Building groundbreaking technology is brutally hard. It takes courage, tale=
nt, and frankly, a willingness to publicly risk embarrassment. OpenAI has c=
ourageously stepped onto this risky stage once again with Agent Mode.=20
But in doing so, they=E2=80=99ve invited scrutiny=E2=80=94and that=E2=80=99=
s exactly why this review matters.
It=E2=80=99s 2025, and we=E2=80=99re sitting at the edge of what could beco=
me a watershed moment for artificial intelligence: the quest for a general-=
purpose AI agent. This isn=E2=80=99t merely a technical curiosity. It=E2=80=
=99s a vision that could reshape entire industries, transform daily workflo=
ws, and redefine productivity. But=E2=80=94and here=E2=80=99s where the sta=
kes become crystal clear=E2=80=94vision is not reality. Yet.
I took on Agent Mode with high hopes. One of the core theses of 2025 is tha=
t adding LLM intelligence to tool use should result in really useful work b=
eing done. I think I=E2=80=99m on track to give that thesis about a C for t=
he year. Coming true in spots (Claude Code is a bright spot), but not by an=
y means universally true. I think we=E2=80=99re uncovering a lot more under=
lying complexity in workflows that current models aren=E2=80=99t yet capabl=
e of tackling independently.
This review isn=E2=80=99t really about critiquing features=E2=80=94it=E2=80=
=99s about asking OpenAI=E2=80=99s Agent to do some of that real work speci=
fically in areas that the team itself highlighted as bright spots (research=
, Excel, PowerPoint, information synthesis, and multi-step tasks). As usual=
, I want to go through real tests, document carefully what I did, and then =
share the results verbatim with you.=20
Agent Mode represents a dream that is one of the biggest in the Valley: Ima=
gine having an AI assistant that can flawlessly build spreadsheets, insight=
ful presentations, and seamlessly navigate complex digital tasks. Imagine w=
hat that would mean for your workflow, your productivity, your competitive =
edge. It may or may not be your dream, but it is more or less the dream Ope=
nAI=E2=80=99s team is building toward. And if this promise isn=E2=80=99t fu=
lly realized yet, it=E2=80=99s worth measuring so we can know precisely how=
 far we are from the goal.
In the review you=E2=80=99re about to dive into, I took Agent Mode through =
five rigorous, real-world tests=E2=80=94no softballs here, only tasks that =
businesses actually wrestle with for real.=20
 Financial portfolio analysis across a portfolio of three dozen equities
Marketing attribution modeling across multiple countries and hundreds of ch=
annels
Strategic real estate acquisition scenarios across US zip codes
Lean customer acquisition strategies for founders and vibe coders
Intricate cross-border incorporation planning for CEOs
The results were illuminating, to put it mildly.
Yes, Agent Mode has arms and legs=E2=80=94it can reach into Google Drive, m=
anipulate spreadsheets, browse the web, and create presentations. This alon=
e is remarkable. But the bigger question=E2=80=94can it use these tools int=
elligently, reliably, and autonomously to enhance human productivity?=E2=80=
=94is where the tests reveal critical insights. The stakes couldn=E2=80=99t=
 be clearer. This isn=E2=80=99t about niche features or incremental improve=
ments; it=E2=80=99s about whether Agent Mode truly brings us closer to a ge=
neral-purpose intelligence that makes us better, faster, smarter.
Why does this matter to you? Because whether you=E2=80=99re a developer, a =
business leader, a product manager, or simply an AI enthusiast, the differe=
nce between promise and performance directly affects your decisions, invest=
ments, and future expectations. You deserve an unvarnished look at how Agen=
t Mode actually performs under real world conditions.
Moreover, this isn=E2=80=99t just an evaluation=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s an hon=
est conversation about what=E2=80=99s achievable, what=E2=80=99s overhyped,=
 and how to navigate expectations wisely. Agent Mode=E2=80=99s current stat=
e holds lessons not just for OpenAI, but for everyone building or relying o=
n AI in critical workflows.
As you read the review, you=E2=80=99ll witness firsthand the ambition, limi=
tations, and potential pitfalls of an agent navigating real-world complexit=
ies. We=E2=80=99re tracing an important step in one of the biggest projects=
 humanity has ever attempted, after all. It=E2=80=99s worth diving deep!
And you know me, each test is deep on tangible detail, and I include actual=
 assets produced by Agent Mode, so if you don=E2=80=99t have it yet you can=
 see how it actually works.=20
With that=E2=80=94let=E2=80=99s dive into the five tests and what you can e=
xpect from OpenAI=E2=80=99s premiere Agent offering of the year=E2=80=A6

Preamble: The Challenge of Building Hard Things
You can look at a lot of things in 2025 as glass-half-full or glass-half-em=
pty. As an example, you=E2=80=99d probably think after reading the piece th=
at follows that Dan Shipper [ https://substack.com/redirect/f1c5427f-5196-4=
408-8dab-2322a71779cb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6=
RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and I would profoundly disagree on our reviews of OpenAI=
=E2=80=99s new Agent Mode.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Dan is opting to see the glass hal=
f full here, and I=E2=80=99m opting to see this one half empty. He and I bo=
th agree Claude Code is a better solution for agentic workflows at this poi=
nt.
And we both agree that ChatGPT Agent Mode is capable of doing large workflo=
ws.
You can read Dan=E2=80=99s full review here [ https://substack.com/redirect=
/77860f41-9908-41fd-8001-4496a67b1365?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQ=
Jf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
So Nate, why are you glass half-empty?
Very simple. Big claims require real-world evidence that actually holds up.=
 And when I read reviews and hype and test results I immediately want to pu=
t this Agent Mode to the test to see how it does on real tests I throw at i=
t.
What I see are the pieces of those big workflows coming together. Deep Rese=
arch does indeed have hands and feet now. I see the care OpenAI as a team h=
as put into making this a safe experience for people, and I appreciate that=
=2E
But I also see an Agent Mode that stumbles in areas where the team claims s=
trengths (like spreadsheets and powerpoints). I think if you=E2=80=99re gon=
na say something is a strength, it shouldn=E2=80=99t just be =E2=80=9Cit ca=
n technically do this now=E2=80=9D (which is true).=20
Instead, my expectation would be that the intelligence OpenAI=E2=80=99s oth=
er models are known for comes through here and we see the strong insights f=
rom say an o3 or o3 Pro coupled with some new excel-building smarts.
I very much want that to be true! But the tests I gave Agent Mode didn=E2=
=80=99t bear out.
Look, building a general purpose agent is incredibly hard. It=E2=80=99s one=
 of the hardest problems in the world right now. Only one or two companies =
are seriously going after it, and I take my beanie off to the OpenAI team f=
or attempting it.
I think OpenAI absolutely correctly framed this as a research preview [ htt=
ps://substack.com/redirect/07cadad8-0ddd-4611-8fc7-21f4bb1d21a2?j=3DeyJ1Ijo=
iNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] with safety cave=
ats. And I think the rate of progress vs. their January release is showing =
me that we are a long long way from a general purpose agent that feels seam=
less in a graphical user interface. We are much closer on the data side (he=
nce me and Dan both leaning toward Claude Code).
And despite my critique below, I think the team was correct to call out tha=
t it is a milestone that the model can do spreadsheets and powerpoint at al=
l. It is! That has been a dream for years. Now it=E2=80=99s real. We contin=
ue to move the goalposts as we see intelligence in action (welcome to being=
 human).
And I=E2=80=99ll go further: the team is not wrong to say real economic wor=
k can be done by this model. I think the glass-half-full part comes in beca=
use I saw the exam scores and the emphasis on excel and powerpoint in the r=
elease and I hoped for a lot more practical work than I think is practical =
now that I=E2=80=99ve used this. I=E2=80=99d grade this as useful for simpl=
e excel and analysis, and likely some helpful digging on your data (Dan has=
 a nice use-case here). Useful, but not compelling yet.
The bar for a general purpose agent needs to be high, or it=E2=80=99s not a=
 general purpose agent.=20
Below you=E2=80=99ll find all five of the tests I ran on Agent Mode that le=
d me to conclude the model isn=E2=80=99t all it=E2=80=99s cracked up to be.=
 I=E2=80=99m also linking a Google Drive with a bunch of the assets produce=
d by the model for transparency here [ https://substack.com/redirect/87cf9f=

UC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Each one is exactly as I received it, including =
the file name.
This preamble has gone on long enough. On to the results! Enjoy the snark, =
and take it with tongue-in-cheek. Remember that it=E2=80=99s possible to be=
 hard on one model and love another from the same company (I adore o3).
And one more thing=E2=80=A6this is the boring release. Rumors are running t=
hat ChatGPT-5 is right around the corner. Nothing here makes me less excite=
d for that!
I. The 58-Minute Cupcake Problem
Here's what convinced me OpenAI's Agent Mode wasn't ready for prime time: W=
ired asked it to order custom cupcakes [ https://substack.com/redirect/11a6=
dab6-e570-4332-8b06-04b7061ad867?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=
hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Simple task, right? Wrong. It took 58 minutes.=
 Nearly one full hour. With half a dozen stops for logins and authenticatio=
n handoffs.
PC Gamer's headline nailed it: "As many as 1 complicated cupcake order per =
hour."
I would not hire this intern.
Think about that for a second. In 58 minutes, I could've driven to three di=
fferent bakeries, taste-tested their offerings, negotiated a bulk discount,=
 and still had time to grab coffee. Hell, I could've learned to pipe frosti=
ng roses from a YouTube tutorial and made the cupcakes myself.
But Agent Mode? It needed an hour to navigate a website my 9yo could handle=
 blindfolded.
Well, maybe it was just the cupcakes! Maybe real world tests would work bet=
ter. I=E2=80=99m not a cupcake guy, so I went for actual work I=E2=80=99ve =
seen done in actual companies.
Five tests. Five real workflows:
Portfolio analysis (because who doesn't want an AI investment advisor?)
Marketing attribution modeling across the US and EU (complete with GDPR com=
pliance)
ZIP code analysis for property investment
A scrappy $1,000 customer acquisition strategy
Cross-border incorporation advice for a US-Canada founding team
These aren't edge cases. I picked these because they are the meat and potat=
oes of modern knowledge work. The stuff we actually need help with.
The results? Let's just say the cupcake disaster was foreshadowing.
Agent Mode has arms and legs now=E2=80=94it can touch Google Drive, build E=
xcel sheets, browse the web. But it's still dragging them like a zombie in =
a B-movie. Every task felt like supervising that intern who's book-smart bu=
t can't figure out which end of the stapler to push.
The pattern became clear fast: Agent Mode thinks. A lot. It asks for permis=
sion. Constantly. It second-guesses itself. Always. And when it finally act=
s? Well, you'll see.
II. Test 1: Portfolio Analysis=20
First test: portfolio analysis. I picked this one because it combined data =
analysis with internet research and powerpoint production, with a side of f=
inancial analysis. I wanted to see if Agent Mode could look at some Robinho=
od holdings and give me something=E2=80=94anything=E2=80=94more insightful =
than "diversification is good."
Here's where things got interesting before they even started. I needed to f=
eed Agent Mode my Robinhood positions. But give it my actual login credenti=
als? Let it navigate my brokerage account where real money lives? After the=
 cupcake incident?
Absolutely not.
So I did what any reasonable person would do: I used a different AI agent t=
o extract the data. Perplexity's Comet scraped my positions from the browse=
r in about 2 minutes. Had to nudge it to spin up python but no drama. It wa=
s like watching the competent intern show up while the anxious one was stil=
l reading the employee handbook.
I couldn't trust Agent Mode with my Robinhood login, but I was supposed to =
trust it with investment advice. The irony wasn't lost on me.
But fine. I hand-fed Agent Mode the position data Comet extracted. Nice cle=
an CSV. Tickers, quantities, current values. Everything it needed to analyz=
e my portfolio and tell me how to optimize for the current market.
What happened next was... technically successful.
Agent Mode churned for a while=E2=80=94thinking, analyzing, researching. It=
 connected to financial data sources, pulled current market metrics, even g=
rabbed some year-to-date performance numbers. Then it produced a PowerPoint=
 deck.
The deck looked professional. Clean templates, branded colors, charts in al=
l the right places. If you squinted, it could've come from any mid-tier fin=
ancial advisor's office. The numbers were accurate. The math checked out. M=
y positions were correctly categorized into their "strategic sleeves"=E2=80=
=94AI barbell, international exposure, real assets, the works.
But the actual advice? The strategic recommendations?
So generic it wasn=E2=80=99t useful at all.
The macro slide literally read like someone copy-pasted from JPMorgan's pub=
lic PDFs. "Deglobalization continues to impact supply chains." No kidding. =
"AI adoption accelerates across sectors." You don't say. "Inflation expecta=
tions remain elevated." Thanks for the breaking news from 2021.
It told me I was underweight international equities. I knew that=E2=80=94it=
's why I asked for help. It suggested I "consider increasing exposure to AI=
-related holdings."=20
I really hoped for better.
The recommendations weren't wrong. They were just useless. It's like asking=
 for investment advice and getting a weather report. "Stocks may go up or d=
own. Diversification is important. Past performance doesn't guarantee futur=
e results."
Sidebar: yes the bar is high
I recognize I am sitting here in the year 2025 complaining about one of the=
 biggest things we all said we wanted the AI to do: be able to do real econ=
omic work and build power points and do excel sheets and actually gets hand=
s on with our data. The irony of seeing this thing work and immediately com=
plaining is not lost on me!
Why am I choosing to be firm here (and admittedly somewhat sarcastic, it=E2=
=80=99s late)? Because I think if you=E2=80=99re going to position this as =
the best agent ever on various exams, and if you=E2=80=99re going to lean e=
xplicitly on strong powerpoint and excel skills in the presentation=E2=80=
=94well then you should be held to a high bar there.
I also am holding this tool to a high bar because I have seen AI models, in=
cluding OpenAI=E2=80=99s own models, do much much better in the past. I hav=
e seen o3 beat this model on insight. I have seen o3 Pro knock it cold out =
of the park. So yes, I expected a little bit better.
Back to it=E2=80=A6 My favorite part? The "Opportunities" slide. Agent Mode=
 identified that I could "optimize tax efficiency through strategic loss ha=
rvesting." That looks actionable, but it=E2=80=99s actionable theater.
You know what would've been actually helpful? Telling me which specific pos=
itions to harvest. When to do it. How to avoid wash sale rules. Actual acti=
onable intelligence.
It was fortune cookie financial advice.
Zero discussion of correlation between my holdings. No analysis of how my t=
ech-heavy portfolio would perform in different rate environments. Nothing a=
bout sector rotation opportunities or specific entry points for new positio=
ns. Hell, a human advisor would at least pretend to have opinions about whe=
ther Tesla is overvalued.
The worst part? It had access to my actual positions, current market data, =
and infinite research capability. It could've backtested strategies, run Mo=
nte Carlo simulations, or identified tax loss harvesting opportunities down=
 to the share lot. Instead, it produced the kind of deck an intern makes by=
 googling "investment presentation template" and filling in the blanks.
I was hoping for so much more.
III. Test 2: Marketing Attribution=20
This test should've been Agent Mode's moment to shine. Excel integration sh=
ould be the cornerstone for useful work, given the fact that most of busine=
ss is still done on spreadsheets (I kid, but slightly). Build me a marketin=
g attribution model across multiple markets=E2=80=94the bread and butter of=
 every marketing team's existence.
The challenge was real-world straightforward: Create an attribution model f=
or an athletic shoe company operating in the US and EU. Track spend and con=
versions across 15 channels for each market. Make it GDPR-compliant for Eur=
opean markets. Budget constraints: $15 million for the US, =E2=82=AC3.75 mi=
llion split across France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the UK.
This is Tuesday afternoon stuff. Every growth marketer has built some versi=
on of this spreadsheet. Or maintained it.
Agent Mode attacked it with confidence. Connected to Excel. Started buildin=
g. Created tabs for each market. Added channels. Formatted cells. It looked=
 like progress. It felt like progress. It was fast!
Then I looked at the numbers.
In Germany, Agent Mode had achieved something miraculous: nearly one conver=
sion per Euro spent. Not per hundred Euros. Not per thousand. Per Euro. Acc=
ording to this model, we could spend =E2=82=AC1 on TikTok ads and get a cus=
tomer.
The New Economy had arrived, apparently.
When I pointed out that this violated basic math=E2=80=94you know, that who=
le "Cost per Acquisition =C3=97 Conversions =3D Spend" thing=E2=80=94Agent =
Mode got defensive. Like that intern who insists they're right even when th=
e spreadsheet is literally showing impossible numbers.
"The calculations are correct based on the formula," it assured me.
I stared at cells showing =E2=82=AC750 in spend yielding 650 conversions. A=
 =E2=82=AC1.15 CAC. For athletic shoes. In Germany. Via paid social.
For context, if you can acquire customers for =E2=82=AC1.15 in any develope=
d market, you don't need an AI assistant. You need a yacht dealer.
Multiple attempts to fix it just made things worse. Agent Mode would "recal=
culate," shuffle some numbers around, and present the same mathematical imp=
ossibilities with slightly different formatting. It's like watching someone=
 confidently solve 2+2=3D5 over and over, each time with more elaborate sho=
wing of their work.
But the math wasn't even the biggest failure.
Remember that GDPR compliance requirement? Zero discussion in the powerpoin=
t. Despite being explicitly invited to think about this, and despite explic=
itly noting there was an issue with the US and EU marketing teams being out=
 of alignment around GDPR. There=E2=80=99s a prompt alignment issue here. T=
he prompt was not subtle!
No discussion of consent management across channels. No consideration of da=
ta residency requirements. Nothing about the attribution window limitations=
 under GDPR. Zero mention of the cookie restrictions that make cross-channe=
l attribution in the EU a completely different beast than US tracking.
Agent Mode didn=E2=80=99t pay any attention.
The PowerPoint it generated to present this disaster was the cherry on top.=
 "Recommendations" included gems like "Focus on high-performing channels" a=
nd "Optimize underperforming markets." It just wasn=E2=80=99t helpful.
The most frustrating part? This wasn't a complex ask. I wasn't requesting s=
ome cutting-edge attribution model with multi-touch algorithmic weighting a=
nd probabilistic matching. Just basic channel math that adds up and some th=
oughtful analysis of regulatory requirements.
Instead, I got an Excel file that violated the laws of mathematics and no d=
iscussion of compliance strategy at all.
When I pushed back harder, Agent Mode finally admitted there "might be some=
 inconsistencies" but immediately said it could fix them, fixed exactly two=
 cells and then called it good.
I really wish it worked better.
IV. Test 3: ZIP Code Analysis=20
Test three seemed foolproof. Dead simple. Find me ZIP codes where buyers ha=
ve leverage for strategic property acquisition. You know, markets where I c=
ould actually negotiate, get a deal, maybe not compete with 47 cash offers.=
 This was supposed to be the easy lowball assignment guys. All public data.=
 All browsing and light powerpoint. Nope.
"Build me a spreadsheet for property acquisition," I told Agent Mode. Clear=
 as day.
What I got back was so disappointing.
Agent Mode proudly presented ten zip codes in places like Gahanna, Ohio and=
 Basking Ridge, New Jersey where houses sell in 27 days with sale-to-list r=
atios above 100%. Where sellers are getting bidding wars. Where buyers are =
literally paying above asking price.
It's like asking for restaurants where you can get a table and getting a li=
st of places with 3-month waits.
The PowerPoint was beautiful, I'll give it that. Professional template. Cle=
an data visualization. Bar charts comparing median listing versus sold pric=
es. Color-coded maps. The kind of deck that would look great in a conferenc=
e room if nobody actually read the content.
But the content? Completely backwards.
Here's Agent Mode's top recommendation: ZIP code 07920, Basking Ridge, with=
 homes selling at 104.98% of list price. Median days on market: 27. That's =
not a buyer's market. That's a seller's feeding frenzy. That's where you go=
 to overpay, not find deals.
When I pointed this out=E2=80=94politely at first=E2=80=94things got weird.
Agent Mode defended itself, started searching in front of me for ways selle=
r=E2=80=99s markets actually worked for buyers.
That's like defending a restaurant's 3-month wait by talking about how popu=
lar it must be.
Sure, hot markets can appreciate. But that wasn't the assignment. I asked f=
or buyer leverage, not "places to compete with Silicon Valley money." I wan=
ted ZIP codes where I could negotiate, not engage in bidding wars.
Again, not what I was hoping for.
V. Test 4: 0-100 Growth Strategy
Here's where I thought Agent Mode might surprise me. Scrappy customer acqui=
sition on a shoestring budget=E2=80=94this is the fun stuff. The creative p=
layground where constraints breed innovation. Give me something clever for =
$1,000. Something that would make growth hackers take notes. And yes, I use=
d a real little project, my own (slowly building) PromptKit.Pro [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/7fa1f848-55a1-497c-b95e-e897e1b1154a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=
TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94actually invit=
ed the model to dive in and explore the product and concept and competitors=
 and market a bit. Nope.
"Create a 0-100 customer acquisition strategy with $1,000," I prompted. "Be=
 creative.=E2=80=9D
What I got back would've made my 9-year-old's lemonade stand business plan =
look like a Peter Thiel masterclass.
Agent Mode's groundbreaking strategy? A laundry list of things people menti=
on on Reddit: Launch platforms. Micro-influencers. Content marketing. Cold =
outreach. Referral programs.
A list. Not a thoughtful strategy.
And the list wasn=E2=80=99t plausible.
Breaking spend into tiny chunks of $50 for categories like micro-influencer=
s. It doesn=E2=80=99t add.=20
Zero creative tactics. Nothing about:
Sponsoring a relevant open-source project
Creating a viral micro-tool that feeds the main product
Partnering with a complementary service for mutual referrals
Building a browser extension that solves one tiny problem perfectly
Maybe a creative meme campaign
Nothing that would make anyone say "Oh, that's clever."
I was hoping for some understanding of strategy here. Some understanding of=
 what it takes to build a sharp acquisition play on the internet in 2025. I=
 did not get it.
VI. Test 5: Incorporation Strategy=20
This one went better. The challenge: incorporation strategy for two founder=
s, one in the US, one in Canada, with dreams of venture funding and cross-b=
order operations. This is the kind of decision that costs real money to fix=
 if you get it wrong.
Credit where it's due: Agent Mode got the basic answer right. Dual corporat=
ion structure. Delaware parent company for the VCs, Canadian subsidiary for=
 the R&D tax credits. Engineering team in Canada to leverage talent and inc=
entives. Sales and business operations in the US for market proximity.
More or less the correct answer given the tax incentives right now.
But here's the thing about $100K decisions=E2=80=94they deserve more than b=
ullet points. This is the kind of strategic choice that determines your tax=
 burden for the next decade. It affects every hire, every investment round,=
 every acquisition opportunity. Getting it "basically right" is like gettin=
g brain surgery "basically right."
The summary was simply too short and too cursory. Especially when I=E2=80=
=99d seen how careful Deep Research was with similar questions. Clean bulle=
t points. Logical flow. Zero depth.
The operational recommendations were particularly thin. "Engineering in Can=
ada, sales in US." Thanks for that groundbreaking insight. How about discus=
sing:
Which Canadian province optimizes for R&D credits versus talent availabilit=
y?
How to structure equity compensation across borders?
Banking relationships and cash management between entities?
Transfer pricing documentation requirements?
Nothing. Just "put engineers in Canada" like it's a game of SimCity.
The worst part? This wasn't even a complex edge case. US-Canada incorporati=
on is a very well-documented pathway on the internet.
This is a decision where details matter. Where the difference between a Can=
adian federal corporation and a British Columbia corporation could save you=
 hundreds of thousands in taxes. Where the wrong structure means your Serie=
s A takes three extra months to close while lawyers untangle your corporate=
 mess.
But Agent Mode treated it like a quiz question. Multiple choice. Pick the r=
ight answer, move on. No discussion of trade-offs. No analysis of alternati=
ves. No "here's what could go wrong" warnings.
Agent Mode got it right here, but not enough right to be genuinely useful. =
And it=E2=80=99s so ironic because I=E2=80=99ve seen other OpenAI models do=
 a really useful job here.
VII. Overall Takeaways
You can see a bunch of the assets the model made at this link [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/be1a6c0c-754e-4f01-9f6d-99700db2334b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
So where do we end up overall?
This model is good at multi-step tasks in a way we haven=E2=80=99t seen bef=
ore. It was able to do a spreadsheet followed by a powerpoint without getti=
ng reminded to stay on task. There=E2=80=99s real potential here.
As advertised, Agent Mode did indeed build both spreadsheets and powerpoint=
s. It does much better when provided with the data directly. Styling ranges=
 from terrible to ok on powerpoints. Spreadsheets top out at very simple ri=
ght now. Yes, I=E2=80=99m sure it will be better in six months, but there=
=E2=80=99s a long way to go.
This model did not do useful work on any of the tasks I gave it. That doesn=
=E2=80=99t mean it can=E2=80=99t, or that the people who say it can are lyi=
ng. I suspect that the useful work ranges are somewhat jagged and narrow, a=
nd it=E2=80=99s about finding what data sources and prompts enable good val=
ue from the model. That said, it=E2=80=99s disappointing to see the model h=
it zero for five here.
The rate of improvement is slow. I have written for awhile about the idea t=
hat we are seeing really jagged intelligence gains, and that valleys or gap=
s in intelligence (like longterm intent) are not closing as fast as they ne=
ed to be to reach generally useful agents that do most tasks across the boa=
rd. I really felt that gap with this model. And I noticed that although it =
got meaningfully better vs. Operator in January, the incremental gains felt=
 much smaller vs. model progress in other areas. When you have a jump from =
o1 to o3 Pro in a few months, you hope for more when you get a similar agen=
t release cadence. Bottom line: Agents are moving slower.
VIII. The Verdict: A Decade-Long Beta Test
Let's call this what it is: OpenAI is building the Tesla of software agents=
=2E They want Agent Mode to navigate ou=
r computers the way Tesla navigates st=
reets. It's an ambitious decade-long project, and Sam Altman's been refresh=
ingly honest about it=E2=80=94they need real-world data to make it work.
Here's the thing: I actually respect the safety-first approach. The constan=
t check-ins, the permission requests, the guardrails=E2=80=94they're annoyi=
ng, but they're not arbitrary. OpenAI is trying to develop intelligence cap=
abilities responsibly.
When Sam Altman warns about email prompt injection, he's not fear-mongering=
=2E He's being responsible. When Agent=20=
Mode asks permission before every purc=
hase, it's not incompetence=E2=80=94it's OpenAI choosing caution over conve=
nience. In a world where AI agents have access to credit cards and private =
documents, that's the right call.
But=E2=80=94and this is the crucial but=E2=80=94that doesn't change the val=
ue equation today.
We're early adopters in the truest sense. Not early like "first iPhone" ear=
ly, where you got revolutionary functionality despite some rough edges. We'=
re early like "first automobile" early, where you need a mechanic riding sh=
otgun and horses are still faster.
So here are my honest recommendations:
If you're in finance and need simple Excel templates: It's worth a shot. Ag=
ent Mode can handle basic financial modeling, and it will be helpful to hav=
e an intern that goes after those spreadsheets for you.
If you have data and can connect it: Give it a try. Again, I think OpenAI i=
s right to emphasize the data connection possibilities, since this gives th=
e agent the chance to hook into data without browsing. It seems to do bette=
r that way (shades of Claude Code and Comet there).=20
If you want a practical assistant today: This isn't it. But that's by desig=
n=E2=80=94OpenAI is building for the long term, not optimizing for quick wi=
ns. Look at specialized tools that solve specific problems well.
The specialized versus general-purpose debate misses the point. OpenAI isn'=
t avoiding specialized agents because they're lazy or misguided. They're be=
tting that general-purpose intelligence, done safely, will eventually subsu=
me all the specialized tools. It's a bold bet. It may take a decade or so t=
o play out. It=E2=80=99s gonna be a heck of a ride along the way.
Here=E2=80=99s to bold bets and the willingness to ship a research preview =
with some very rough edges!

 I see are the pieces of those big workflows coming together. Deep Research=
 does indeed have hands and feet now. I see the care OpenAI as a team has p=

 the intelligence OpenAI=E2=80=99s other models are known for comes through=

 I think the team was correct to call out that it is a milestone that the m=

=E2=80=99ll go further: the team is not wrong to say real economic work can=
 be done by this model. I think the glass-half-full part comes in because I=
 saw the exam scores and the emphasis on excel and powerpoint in the releas=

 Agent Mode could look at some Robinhood holdings and give me something=E2=

0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But fine.=
 I hand-fed Agent Mode the position data Comet extracted. Nice clean CSV. T=

 to financial data sources, pulled current market metrics, even grabbed som=

 we all said we wanted the AI to do: be able to do real economic work and b=

 lost on me!</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=

useful work, given the fact that most of business is still done on spreadsh=

26px;font-size: 16px;">The challenge was real-world straightforward: Create=
 an attribution model for an athletic shoe company operating in the US and =
EU. Track spend and conversions across 15 channels for each market. Make it=
 GDPR-compliant for European markets. Budget constraints: $15 million for t=
he US, =E2=82=AC3.75 million split across France, Germany, Spain, Italy, an=

It looked like progress. It felt like progress. It was fast!</p><p style=3D=

p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=

26px;font-size: 16px;">Multiple attempts to fix it just made things worse. =
Agent Mode would &quot;recalculate,&quot; shuffle some numbers around, and =
present the same mathematical impossibilities with slightly different forma=

each time with more elaborate showing of their work.</p><p style=3D"margin:=

plicitly invited to think about this, and despite explicitly noting there w=
as an issue with the US and EU marketing teams being out of alignment aroun=

seful agents that do most tasks across the board. I really felt that gap wi=
th this model. And I noticed that although it got meaningfully better vs. O=
perator in January, the incremental gains felt much smaller vs. model progr=
ess in other areas. When you have a jump from o1 to o3 Pro in a few months,=
 you hope for more when you get a similar agent release cadence. </span><st=

g Beta Test</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Let's call this what it is: OpenAI is=
 building the Tesla of software agents. They want Agent Mode to navigate ou=
r computers the way Tesla navigates streets. It's an ambitious decade-long =
project, and Sam Altman's been refreshingly honest about it=E2=80=94they ne=
ed real-world data to make it work.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=
: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's the thing: I act=
ually respect the safety-first approach. The constant check-ins, the permis=
sion requests, the guardrails=E2=80=94they're annoying, but they're not arb=
itrary. OpenAI is trying to develop intelligence capabilities responsibly.<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">When Sam Altman warns about email prompt injection, he's no=
t fear-mongering. He's being responsible. When Agent Mode asks permission b=
efore every purchase, it's not incompetence=E2=80=94it's OpenAI choosing ca=
ution over convenience. In a world where AI agents have access to credit ca=
rds and private documents, that's the right call.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =

on today.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>We're early adopters in the truest sense.=
 Not early like &quot;first iPhone&quot; early, where you got revolutionary=
 functionality despite some rough edges.</strong><span> </span><strong>We'r=

e are my honest recommendations:</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>If you're in finan=
ce and need simple Excel templates:</strong><span> It's worth a shot. Agent=
 Mode can handle basic financial modeling, and it will be helpful to have a=

margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
><strong>If you have data and can connect it: </strong><span>Give it a try.=
 Again, I think OpenAI is right to emphasize the data connection possibilit=
ies, since this gives the agent the chance to hook into data without browsi=
ng. It seems to do better that way (shades of Claude Code and Comet there).=
 </span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=

x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The specialize=
d versus general-purpose debate misses the point. OpenAI isn't avoiding spe=
cialized agents because they're lazy or misguided. They're betting that gen=
eral-purpose intelligence, done safely, will eventually subsume all the spe=
cialized tools. It's a bold bet. It may take a decade or so to play out. It=
