is-out-and-its-easily-the

I've been testing AI models for years now. They=E2=80=99re helpful. They=E2=
=80=99re tactical. They=E2=80=99re recently becoming strategic. But they ha=
ven=E2=80=99t been resonant=E2=80=94models with perspective so spot on I ju=
st can=E2=80=99t get it out of my head. o3 Pro is the first model to pass t=
hat test.
Yes, I thought o3 was a big deal. I put a lot of work into how you prompt o=
3 [ https://substack.com/redirect/46436019-9195-47c4-90b3-389fb8f41e41?j=3D=
eyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Hard to =
believe that was just 48 days ago. FML. At the time, o3 struck me as smart,=
 slightly cold, and very strong on technical intelligence. Over the ~6 week=
s since, it=E2=80=99s become an inseparable sparring partner at work.
Well, big brother just arrived. o3 Pro is a different beast altogether. The=
 model takes ~10x as long to respond (we=E2=80=99re talking go get a sandwi=
ch times here). Yep, that makes it sensitive to prompts. I=E2=80=99ll get i=
nto that down below.
For now, I=E2=80=99ll just get the elephant out of the room: this is unques=
tionably the best model in the world right now. I get asked it a lot, and a=
 lot of the time now the answer is =E2=80=9Cwell these three are very close=
=E2=80=9D and then I usually mention an OpenAI model, a Google model, an An=
thropic model, and a DeepSeek model is close behind. Maybe Grok 3.
Not today. Not for a little while anyway. o3 Pro is the first model that gi=
ves me perspective I can take without filtering straight to a founder or C-=
suite leader. It=E2=80=99s sharply strategic enough (with proper prompting)=
 to not need further polish to start a conversation about a meaningful deci=
sion. You=E2=80=99ll see below=E2=80=94we do a roadmap comparison. We also =
do a coding challenge, and for good measure we do a tough web research task=
 (yes it=E2=80=99s about that paper [ https://open.substack.com/pub/natesne=
wsletter/p/lets-talk-that-apple-ai-paperheres?r=3D1z4sm5&utm_campaign=3Dpos=
t&utm_medium=3Dweb&showWelcomeOnShare=3Dfalse ]). o3 Pro vs. o3, every time=
=2E o3 Pro wins easily. Every time.=20
I=E2=80=99m not saying this is a perfect model. I=E2=80=99ll call out some =
caveats toward the end of the piece. But this is absolutely a model that wi=
ll give people who choose to use it well super powers. For now, it=E2=80=99=
s available on Pro and Teams accounts, but since they cut o3 pricing by 80%=
 today, and since they=E2=80=99re launching o3 Pro in API for 87% less than=
 o1 Pro, I=E2=80=99d expect o3 Pro to serve down (in limited quantities) to=
 lower plans soon. Here=E2=80=99s what you need to know to make the most of=
 it=E2=80=A6
PS. Yes, you=E2=80=99re gonna get my full prompt plus the full responses of=
 both o3 and o3 Pro across all three of the tests I did, plus a handy criti=
que from Opus 4 as well, just for fun!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
By The Numbers
Yes, in short, all the numbers agree this is the best model. I think number=
s are a bit overblown these days because I find they often reflect test per=
formance more than they reflect real world performance.
But, if you=E2=80=99re interested, here are a few charts that tell the stor=
y=E2=80=A6
o3 is very good at math and code (no surprise)
It=E2=80=99s the #159 coder in the world
And it=E2=80=99s cheap enough developers can afford to use it
But let=E2=80=99s leave all that aside for a minute. How does it really mea=
sure up in the real world?=20
I put it to the test, and I think I have my finger on why this model is spe=
cial=E2=80=A6
The Resonance Test: Why o3 Pro Is the First AI That Thinks Like a Strategic=
 Partner
There's a moment in every founder's journey when you realize you've outgrow=
n your current advisors. The people who helped you get to $1M ARR suddenly =
feel... limited. Their pattern matching works for obvious problems, but whe=
n you're staring at genuinely strategic decisions=E2=80=94the kind that def=
ine the next three years of your company=E2=80=94you need someone who can s=
ee around corners.
And yes, people can do that stuff. Paul Graham has made a career of it.
I've been waiting for an AI model to reach that level for a long time. Not =
just "better at coding" or "faster at research," but genuinely strategic. M=
aybe not legendary startup guru strategic (give it 48 days) but for now at =
least strategic enough to have a meaningful conversation.
After kicking around some questions designed to push the strategy muscles v=
s little cousin o3, I feel good about saying this: o3 Pro is the first AI t=
hat thinks like the strategic partner you wish you could afford to hire. (B=
ut the catch is you have to prompt it right to get it to talk.)
What Struck Me Most
Here's what struck me most about my head-to-head tests: o3 Pro didn't just =
win on hard problems or complex analysis. It won consistently, across compl=
etely different domains, in ways that revealed a fundamental shift in how i=
t approaches thinking.
On problem solving with code [ https://substack.com/redirect/fb0c647a-967b-=
4e16-8689-cc42907080e0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]: When I asked both models to design a Wordle solver, o3 g=
ave me code that worked. o3 Pro gave me code that worked and included perfo=
rmance optimizations I hadn't asked for (@lru_cache decorators, cleaner enc=
oding schemes) plus the kind of variable naming and structure that signals =
professional craftsmanship. The difference between "gets the job done" and =
"builds something that=E2=80=99s designed to run efficiently from day 1."
On strategic planning [ https://substack.com/redirect/93de5a69-7e19-46a2-a6=
28-369a897c0f7f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tA=
jMRMPOw0 ]: Both models produced 12-month AI roadmaps for Datadog. o3's pla=
n was competent=E2=80=94it hit the major points, included reasonable timeli=
nes, addressed obvious risks. o3 Pro's plan was insightful. It led with "AI=
 only adds shareholder value when it is tightly fused to the data exhaust w=
e already dominate"=E2=80=94a frame that immediately clarifies strategy rat=
her than just listing features. It recognized that Datadog's real moat isn'=
t AI capabilities but data architecture, and built the entire roadmap aroun=
d leveraging that asymmetric advantage. It was proactive, not defensive. It=
 was detailed and compellingly clear while not losing technical detail.
On research analysis [ https://substack.com/redirect/331dd9d0-ee3a-413a-91e=
5-2b450a9b6336?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ]: I threw both models at Apple's recent paper on reasoning model l=
imitations. o3 produced thorough analysis but tried to include everything, =
including a poorly executed social media section that added noise. o3 Pro l=
eveled up analysis by making it more readable and insightful, and then dunk=
ed the ball by making an editorial judgment call=E2=80=94it skipped the Twi=
tter analysis entirely and explained why: "I chose to keep the core deliver=
able clean and on-spec rather than padding with low-value content." That's =
not just better analysis; it's better professional judgment.
The pattern was unmistakable: o3 Pro wasn't just producing better outputs, =
it was making better decisions about what to produce. It chose to shut up.
Why It's Actually Easier to Work With
But here's what really caught my attention: o3 Pro is vastly easier to read=
=2E Not because it's simpler, but becau=
se it's better at translating complex=20=
ideas into accessible language without losing sophistication.
When explaining technical concepts, o3 would give you accurate but dense ex=
planations full of jargon. o3 Pro gives you clear, plain English that still=
 carries all the technical nuance. It's the difference between reading a ac=
ademic paper and reading a really good explanation from a senior engineer w=
ho cares about being understood.
Here=E2=80=99s o3 (this is not ready for C-suite)
Here=E2=80=99s o3 Pro (this is roughly ready for C-suite)
For the first time, you have an AI that can think at expert level but expla=
in itself at human level. That matters more than any benchmark score.
A Different Kind of Optimization
I noticed something else interesting in my testing: o3 Pro seems optimized =
for complete, end-to-end reasoning across tool calls + prompt. When I attac=
hed documents, it felt very free to step away from those documents rather t=
han being constrained by them. When I asked it to synthesize information fr=
om multiple sources and draw strategic conclusions, it was substantially be=
tter.
This suggests OpenAI made a deliberate architectural choice: optimize for c=
omplete strategic thinking rather than information extraction. That's exact=
ly what you'd want if you're building toward AGI-level strategic partners r=
ather than just better research assistants. Presumably, the bet is they=E2=
=80=99ll have other models for the research details.
This reminds me of the anatomy of the prompt from this review of o3 Pro [ h=
ttps://substack.com/redirect/5b68b2ce-e50b-47c6-af1c-0f358b92d8f2?j=3DeyJ1I=
joiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
You gotta give this model a lot of context, but you need to do it in the pr=
ompt. It=E2=80=99s hungry, and it=E2=80=99s a fiercely global thinker.
Prompting Caveats
This model (as you can see above) is not easy to prompt. It is a slower res=
ponse curve (hello 15 minute calls) and it=E2=80=99s extremely picky. I wil=
l probably do a separate post just on the vagaries of prompting o3 Pro, but=
 for now I will say the following:
This model is a global thinker, so assume it=E2=80=99s going to fetch extra=
 context whether you ask it to or not=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s what it is bui=
lt to do
If you=E2=80=99re smart, you=E2=80=99ll prompt it for the context you want =
it to focus on both via tool calls and in the prompt itself
This model has crossed the persuasion event horizon, and you=E2=80=99ll nee=
d to ask another model (like Opus 4) to fact check facts and figures=E2=80=
=94the thinking will hold up but you need to be sure the global context is =
actually pulling from sources you feel good about
If the model does hallucinate, you=E2=80=99re probably not going to see it =
intuitively because it looks so darn good and is nested with so many other =
accurate figures=E2=80=94yes this makes it a model for grownups who are car=
eful thinkers
This model demands hard problems and if you feed it boring problems it real=
ly does grind and overthink=E2=80=94give it problems that actually require =
the GPU cycles
What Makes o3 Pro Feel Different
Let me be specific about what I mean by "strategic thought partner." I'm ta=
lking about AI that can:
Frame problems in ways you hadn't considered ("This isn't about AI features=
, it's about leveraging data asymmetries")
Make judgment calls about what matters (choosing depth over comprehensivene=
ss when appropriate)
Offer perspectives that stick with you (insights you find yourself returnin=
g to hours later)
Communicate complex ideas accessibly (without dumbing them down)
Think in terms of competitive advantage (not just operational efficiency)
Every founder I know has a small circle of people they turn to for this kin=
d of thinking. Usually investors, experienced operators, or industry vetera=
ns who've seen enough patterns to offer genuine strategic insight rather th=
an just tactical advice.
I think o3 Pro is the first AI model that can consistently operate at that =
level, if fed properly.
Three Key Implications
First, the arbitrage opportunity is massive. I've seen consulting projects =
charge $50,000 for strategic analysis that o3 Pro can produce for under $10=
 in API costs. When you combine genuinely strategic-level thinking with 87%=
 cost reduction, entire categories of expensive human expertise become demo=
cratically accessible. Don=E2=80=99t pay McKinsey for a review of your busi=
ness=E2=80=94do it with o3 Pro.
Second, this changes the quality bar for AI work. Previous models required =
extensive human editing and oversight. o3 Pro consistently produces work yo=
u can present directly in important contexts. That's not incremental improv=
ement=E2=80=94it's crossing a threshold from "helpful assistant" to "strate=
gic colleague."
Third, we're approaching abundant intelligence. Complex topics that were pr=
eviously gated behind technical expertise or expensive consultants are now =
accessible to anyone willing to craft thoughtful prompts. The constraint sh=
ifts from access to intelligence to knowing what questions to ask.
The Economics Are Flipping Completely
Here's the uncomfortable truth about previous "Pro" AI models: the quality =
gap rarely justified the cost premium. You paid more for marginally better =
outputs that still required significant human editing and oversight.
With o3 Pro, the economics don't just improve=E2=80=94they flip entirely. o=
3 Pro costs 87% less than o1-pro while delivering dramatically superior str=
ategic thinking. We're talking about $20 per million input tokens compared =
to o1-pro's $150, with output costs dropping from $600 to $80 per million t=
okens.
This isn't just a better deal=E2=80=94it's evidence of what Sam Altman desc=
ribed today [ https://substack.com/redirect/90aa47c5-8518-40c0-8c21-62d348a=
99347?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
 as "intelligence too cheap to meter" becoming reality. When strategic-leve=
l AI thinking costs 87% less while being substantially better, we're witnes=
sing the early stages of abundant intelligence.
The arbitrage opportunity isn't just staggering=E2=80=94it's becoming civil=
izational, which is exactly the point Sam makes in his essay today:
Where This Is Heading (And Why Today Matters)
The notes above are from the "The Gentle Singularity [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/90aa47c5-8518-40c0-8c21-62d348a99347?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]" that puts o3 Pro's release in pe=
rfect context. "We are past the event horizon; the takeoff has started," he=
 writes, but "it's much less weird than it seems like it should be."
That's exactly what testing o3 Pro feels like. You're interacting with genu=
inely strategic-level intelligence, but it doesn't feel alien or disruptive=
=2E It feels like finally having access=
 to the kind of thinking you've always=
 wanted but couldn't afford.
Altman describes how "wonders become routine, and then table stakes." Six m=
onths ago, having an AI produce strategic analysis that passes the resonanc=
e test would have felt miraculous. Today, it's starting to feel like a new =
baseline. What seemed impossible becomes inevitable remarkably quickly.
But here's what makes this moment significant: if o3 Pro represents strateg=
ic thinking at the individual level, the next question is organizational de=
ployment. What happens when every founder has access to board-level strateg=
ic thinking? When every product manager can stress-test roadmaps against ma=
rket dynamics? When every teacher can provide graduate-level feedback to ev=
ery student?
Altman points to scientists already being "two or three times more producti=
ve" with current AI. With o3 Pro's combination of strategic insight and 87%=
 cost reduction, we're looking at a compression of strategic intelligence t=
hat could reshape how decisions get made across every industry.
We're not just getting better AI tools. We're approaching what Altman calls=
 "intelligence too cheap to meter"=E2=80=94and o3 Pro is the first model th=
at makes that future feel tangible rather than theoretical.
The Resonance Test in Practice
I keep coming back to that resonance test. Good AI outputs are useful in th=
e moment. Great AI outputs stick with you. They reframe how you think about=
 problems. They surface insights you reference weeks later in completely di=
fferent contexts.
o3 Pro consistently passes that test in a way no previous model has. It off=
ers perspectives specific enough to resonate, strategic enough to matter, a=
nd accessible enough to implement.
That's not just better AI. That's AI that can genuinely participate in the =
kind of thinking that shapes companies, markets, and industries.
Getting Started (The Right Way)
If you're a Pro user, don't waste o3 Pro on throwaway questions. Start with=
 something strategic=E2=80=94a real decision you're grappling with, a compl=
ex problem you've been avoiding, or a framework you need to build for somet=
hing important.
Give it the kind of prompt you'd send to your smartest advisor:
I'm trying to decide whether to [complex strategic decision].=20
Help me think through this systematically. What am I missing?=20
[Insert LOTS of CONTEXT about the problem space here=E2=80=94like 50-100 li=
nes]
What questions should I be asking that I'm not? What would=20
you do in my position and why?
Then watch what happens. You'll know within the first few minutes whether t=
his represents the strategic upgrade you've been waiting for.
Want something simpler? This is a short one with real power if you talk to =
ChatGPT regularly.
Based on everything you know about me, what would make me 50% happier?
I was really surprised at the difference between o3 Pro and o3 on that one.
The Bottom Line
For two years, I've been testing AI models looking for one that could genui=
nely enhance strategic thinking rather than just automate tactical work. o3=
 Pro is the first model that consistently delivers insights I find myself r=
eferencing days later, frameworks I actually use for important decisions, a=
nd perspectives that genuinely shift how I approach problems.
Sam Altman wrote today that we're climbing "the long arc of exponential tec=
hnological progress; it always looks vertical looking forward and flat goin=
g backwards, but it's one smooth curve." o3 Pro feels like evidence of that=
 curve steepening (just 48 days after o3). We're not just getting increment=
ally better AI=E2=80=94we're approaching the kind of abundant intelligence =
that transforms how strategic work gets done.
The future of work isn't AI replacing human judgment. It's AI democratizing=
 access to the kind of strategic thinking that previously required years of=
 experience, expensive consultants, or rare talent. o3 Pro, with its combin=
ation of strategic insight and 87% cost reduction, is the first model that =
makes that future feel not just possible, but inevitable.
As Altman puts it: "wonders become routine, and then table stakes." Strateg=
ic-level AI thinking is about to become table stakes. The question isn't wh=
ether this transformation is coming=E2=80=94it's how you=E2=80=99ll use it.
And yes, there=E2=80=99s a new open-source model coming from OpenAI later t=
his summer, plus full o4, plus o4 Pro (probably), plus GPT-5 (likely this y=
ear). And we=E2=80=99re not even looking at all the other work the other mo=
del makers are doing! Buckle your seatbelts for takeoff=E2=80=A6

optimized for complete, end-to-end reasoning across tool calls + prompt. Wh=
en I attached documents, it felt very free to step away from those document=

 strategic analysis that o3 Pro can produce for under $10 in API costs. Whe=
n you combine genuinely strategic-level thinking with 87% cost reduction, e=

;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Second, this changes the quali=
ty bar for AI work.</strong><span> Previous models required extensive human=
 editing and oversight. o3 Pro consistently produces work you can present d=
irectly in important contexts. That's not incremental improvement=E2=80=94i=
t's crossing a threshold from &quot;helpful assistant&quot; to &quot;strate=

 gated behind technical expertise or expensive consultants are now accessib=

The Gentle Singularity</a><span>&quot; that puts o3 Pro's release in perfec=
t context. &quot;We are past the event horizon; the takeoff has started,&qu=
ot; he writes, but &quot;it's much less weird than it seems like it should =
be.&quot;</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That's exactly what testing o3 Pro feels l=
ike. You're interacting with genuinely strategic-level intelligence, but it=
 doesn't feel alien or disruptive. It feels like finally having access to t=
he kind of thinking you've always wanted but couldn't afford.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Altman describes how &quot;wonders become routine, and then table stak=
es.&quot; Six months ago, having an AI produce strategic analysis that pass=
es the resonance test would have felt miraculous. Today, it's starting to f=
eel like a new baseline. What seemed impossible becomes inevitable remarkab=
ly quickly.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's what makes this moment significant: =
if o3 Pro represents strategic thinking at the individual level, the next q=
uestion is organizational deployment. What happens when every founder has a=
ccess to board-level strategic thinking? When every product manager can str=
ess-test roadmaps against market dynamics? When every teacher can provide g=
raduate-level feedback to every student?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Altman points to s=
cientists already being &quot;two or three times more productive&quot; with=
 current AI. With o3 Pro's combination of strategic insight and 87% cost re=
duction, we're looking at a compression of strategic intelligence that coul=
d reshape how decisions get made across every industry.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We'=
re not just getting better AI tools. We're approaching what Altman calls &q=
uot;intelligence too cheap to meter&quot;=E2=80=94and o3 Pro is the first m=
odel that makes that future feel tangible rather than theoretical.</p><h2 c=

k with you. They reframe how you think about problems. They surface insight=
s you reference weeks later in completely different contexts.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">For two years, I've been testing AI models looking for one that c=
ould genuinely enhance strategic thinking rather than just automate tactica=
l work. o3 Pro is the first model that consistently delivers insights I fin=
d myself referencing days later, frameworks I actually use for important de=
cisions, and perspectives that genuinely shift how I approach problems.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Sam Altman wrote today that we're climbing &quot;the long arc =
of exponential technological progress; it always looks vertical looking for=
ward and flat going backwards, but it's one smooth curve.&quot; o3 Pro feel=
s like evidence of that curve steepening (just 48 days after o3). We're not=
 just getting incrementally better AI=E2=80=94we're approaching the kind of=
 abundant intelligence that transforms how strategic work gets done.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">The future of work isn't AI replacing human judgment. It's AI dem=
ocratizing access to the kind of strategic thinking that previously require=
d years of experience, expensive consultants, or rare talent. o3 Pro, with =
its combination of strategic insight and 87% cost reduction, is the first m=
odel that makes that future feel not just possible, but inevitable.</p><p s=
