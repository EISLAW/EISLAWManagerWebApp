DAILY MEMO: TRUMP MEETS SYRIAN LEADER [3]
THE ENCOUNTER COULD PAVE THE WAY TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
SUPPORT FOR SYRIA. U.S. President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after Trump announced he would lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman was also present for the meeting, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined by phone. It was the first meeting between U.S. and Syrian leaders in 25 years. According to
the White House press secretary [4], Trump called on al-Sharaa to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, expel all foreign terrorists from the country, help the U.S. prevent the Islamic State’s
resurgence and take control over IS detention centers in northeast Syria. They also discussed regional concerns, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Gaza. Israel, meanwhile, likely
will not be pleased about the developments. The Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news outlet reported [5] that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trump not to ease sanctions on or support stability in Syria
during a White House meeting last month.
IRAN'S OFFER. Iran has proposed creating a consortium of Middle Eastern countries to enrich uranium [6], which has been a critical obstacle in nuclear talks with the United States. The consortium,
which would include Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, would be an alternative to U.S. demands that Tehran completely abandon its uranium enrichment activities. The proposal includes the
possibility of Tehran enriching uranium to 3.67 percent and supplying it to other Arab countries for civilian use. Foreign observers, including from the United States, would then be allowed to inspect
Iran's nuclear facilities.
EUROPEAN PATH. Representatives from the U.K., France and Germany will reportedly meet with Iranian officials in Istanbul on May 16 [7] for nuclear talks. The meeting was previously scheduled for May 2
but postponed over European concerns that it could undermine U.S. negotiations with Tehran, which are expected to continue in the coming days.
BUSINESS DEMANDS. Russian President Vladimir Putin met on Tuesday with representatives of Business Russia [8], an organization representing the interests of private Russian companies, to discuss
support for major corporations across the country. They also discussed the prospect of foreign businesses returning to the Russian market. Relatedly, the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs proposed certain conditions [9] for readmitting foreign companies that left the country following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They include that the companies assign more than 50
percent ownership to Russian residents, allow the transfer of rights to technologies, and promote the presence of all management, production and intellectual operations of the business in Russia.
TRADE WITH UKRAINE. The European Union is preparing to raise duties on Ukrainian goods in the coming weeks, the Financial Times reported [10]. According to the story, the bloc plans to terminate an
agreement, signed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that allowed Ukrainian goods to enter the EU tariff-free. It will be replaced by transitional measures until a new arrangement is negotiated. The
deal, set to expire June 6, was heavily criticized by producers, especially in Poland, for giving an unfair advantage to Ukrainian exporters.
NO TROOPS FOR UKRAINE. Poland does not have any plans to send troops to western Ukraine, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said [11] in a social media post. His comment came after U.S.
special envoy Keith Kellogg suggested in a Fox News interview that Poland could be part of a Western “resilience force” stationed in Ukraine after a peace deal is reached with Russia.
RUSSIAN WEAPONS. India has formally requested additional S-400 air defense systems from Russia, the India Today weekly reported [12]. The systems played a critical role in Operation Sindoor, which
India launched last week in response to a deadly attack in Pahalgam that New Delhi blamed on a Pakistan-based group. According to sources who spoke to the publication, the S-400s demonstrated high
accuracy and effectiveness in intercepting missiles and drones launched from Pakistan during the operation.
EUROPE'S NUCLEAR UMBRELLA. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that he would consider the deployment of French nuclear weapons to other parts of Europe [13]. In an interview with French
broadcaster TF1, Macron noted that U.S. nuclear weapons are already stationed in countries like Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey, and said he would soon outline a framework for discussions on the
matter. He emphasized, however, that France would not finance the security of other countries and that such initiatives could not undermine France’s own defense needs.
DRILLS. China and Cambodia began on Wednesday their largest-ever joint military exercises [14]. The two-week drills will involve 900 Chinese military personnel and more than 1,300 Cambodian soldiers,
as well as advanced Chinese military hardware, including armored vehicles, helicopters, warships, reconnaissance drones and "robot battle dogs."
