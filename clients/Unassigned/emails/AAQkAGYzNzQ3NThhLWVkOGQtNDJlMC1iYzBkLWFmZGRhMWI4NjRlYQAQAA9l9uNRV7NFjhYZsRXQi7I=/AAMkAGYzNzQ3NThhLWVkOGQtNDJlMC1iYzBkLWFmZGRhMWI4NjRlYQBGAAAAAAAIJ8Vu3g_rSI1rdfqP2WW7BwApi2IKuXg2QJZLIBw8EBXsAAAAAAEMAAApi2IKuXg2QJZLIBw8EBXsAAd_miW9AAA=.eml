Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): A step-by-step reasoning process used by models to =
solve problems. Long CoT refers to reasoning paths with many intermediate s=
teps, often needed for complex tasks.
Knowledge Distillation: A training technique where a smaller student model =
learns to imitate a larger teacher model (or an ensemble of models). MoT ex=
tends this to multiple teachers, merging their knowledge into one student.
Reinforcement Learning (RL): A training paradigm where an agent (or model) =
learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties. In the context =
of LLMs, RL is used to improve behaviors (like reasoning or following instr=
uctions) by rewarding correct or desired outputs. Variants include RL with =
human feedback (RLHF) and outcome-based RL that rewards only final answers.
Self-Play: A training technique where an AI plays both sides of a game or t=
ask. In language self-play, an LLM generates challenges and solves them its=
elf, enabling it to improve without external data. This game-theoretic appr=
oach can lead to stronger performance as the model iteratively outcompetes =
its past self.
Verifiable Rewards: A reinforcement learning reward signal that comes from =
checking the correctness of an answer with a reliable method. For example, =
using a code interpreter or a math solver to verify an LLM=E2=80=99s answer=
 and then giving reward if correct. This helps train models on objective ta=
sks like math proofs or code where outcomes can be validated.
Speculative Decoding: An inference speed-up technique where a smaller model=
 generates several tokens in advance (speculatively) and a larger model ver=
ifies or corrects them. This can greatly accelerate text generation without=
 much loss in quality.
Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/=

f9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Researchers introduced Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) as a lightweight=
 framework to distill reasoning skills from multiple =E2=80=9Cteacher=E2=80=
=9D models into one student model. The key insight is that no single teache=
r is best for all tasks =E2=80=93 by alternating between fine-tuning on eac=
h teacher=E2=80=99s outputs and merging the resulting students in weight sp=
ace, MoT fuses diverse problem-solving strategies into a compact model. App=
lied to math reasoning, a MoT-trained 14B model surpassed larger models (30=
B+ parameters) on competition benchmarks. It also outperformed both single-=
teacher distillation and naive multi-teacher blending, raising performance =
ceilings while reducing overfitting. Notably, MoT improved general reasonin=
g beyond math and even produced a student model that became a better teache=
r itself =E2=80=93 showing that combining teachers=E2=80=99 knowledge leads=
 to robust, broadly applicable reasoning skills.

A massive new survey (100+ pages, 39 authors!) examines how reinforcement l=
earning has been used to boost reasoning in large language models. RL has d=
riven impressive gains in logical tasks like math and coding, effectively t=
ransforming LLMs into Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). The survey reviews cor=
e components (like reward design and curriculum), key challenges (scaling u=
p RL requires huge compute, better algorithms, and more data), and recent m=
ilestones (e.g. the DeepSeek-R1 series). Crucially, as we push toward ever =
more capable models (even dreaming of Artificial SuperIntelligence), RL wil=
l need new strategies to remain effective at scale. The authors map out fut=
ure directions, encouraging research on more efficient RL algorithms, bette=
r benchmarks, and techniques to maintain diversity and generalization. This=
 comprehensive review is a timely roadmap for anyone working on RL-enhanced=
 reasoning, highlighting how far we=E2=80=99ve come and what hurdles lie ah=
ead.

RL-based post-training can teach language models complex reasoning without =
supervised data, but scaling this is tricky and expensive. Enter Swarm sAmp=

nguage model fine-tuning. SAPO treats a network of many compute nodes like =
a swarm: each node runs its own policy model, sharing its experience rollou=
ts with others instead of relying on a central controller. This design side=
steps common bottlenecks (latency, memory limits) in distributed RL and eve=
n encourages =E2=80=9CAha! moments=E2=80=9D to spread across the swarm as o=
ne model=E2=80=99s discovery benefits all. In experiments, SAPO achieved up=
 to +94% cumulative reward over baseline in controlled tasks. The team also=
 tested it on a volunteer network of thousands of nodes, demonstrating robu=
st performance in a real-world open-source demo. By embracing collective le=
arning, SAPO offers an efficient route to post-train LLMs at scale, showing=
 that sharing experience truly is caring in multi-node RL.

Large models usually reason sequentially (one step after another), but what=
 if they could reason in parallel? The Parallel-R1 framework trains an LLM =
to explore multiple reasoning paths concurrently for hard problems. Prior a=
ttempts to induce this =E2=80=9Cparallel thinking=E2=80=9D used supervised =
fine-tuning on synthetic data, which often led to imitation rather than tru=
e exploration. Parallel-R1 instead employs a clever two-stage training via =
RL: first use easier tasks and supervised prompts to teach the model how to=
 consider alternatives in parallel, then switch to RL on harder tasks to ha=
ve the model practice and generalize this skill. On math benchmarks like MA=
TH and AIME, this approach boosted solution accuracy by 8.4% over a standar=
d sequential-thinking RL model. Intriguingly, the trained model=E2=80=99s b=
ehavior evolved: early in training it used parallel thinking to explore dif=
ferent strategies, and later it used it to verify answers from multiple per=
spectives. The most striking result was a 42.9% performance jump on a diffi=
cult exam (AIME25) by using parallel thinking as a mid-training =E2=80=9Cex=
ploration scaffold=E2=80=9D. In short, having an LLM entertain several poss=
ible answers at once =E2=80=93 and learn when to branch out or double-check=
 =E2=80=93 can dramatically improve reasoning. Parallel-R1 is the first RL =
framework to successfully instill this capability, pointing to a new avenue=
 for training smarter problem-solvers.

K2-Think employed a six-pillar recipe combining multiple training and infer=

), plus advanced inference-time methods like test-time scaling (leveraging =
ensembles or self-consistency), speculative decoding for speed-ups, and eve=

Scaling LLMs usually demands huge curated datasets =E2=80=93 but this work =
shows a way to improve models with zero new data. The idea is Language Self=
-Play (LSP): let the model teach itself through a game where it plays both =
roles. In LSP, a single model takes turns being the Challenger (posing a di=
fficult query or task) and the Solver (attempting to answer it). By pitting=
 the model against itself, each round generates new training examples on th=
e fly, targeted at the model=E2=80=99s weaknesses. The authors added safegu=
ards like KL-divergence regularization and a =E2=80=9Cself-reward=E2=80=9D =
signal to keep the self-play on track and high-quality. They experimented w=
ith a 3B-parameter Llama model and found that LSP fine-tuning boosted the m=
odel=E2=80=99s performance on hard tasks beyond what a data-trained baselin=
e achieved. In fact, self-play alone outperformed using additional real tra=
ining data on certain instruction-following benchmarks. This is a compellin=
g proof-of-concept that an LLM can generate the challenges and feedback it =
needs to get better. By removing the dependency on ever-growing datasets, l=
anguage self-play offers a tantalizing path toward more sustainable model i=
mprovement =E2=80=93 letting models autonomously sharpen their skills in a =
=E2=80=9Cdata-free=E2=80=9D regime.

A team at Salesforce Research introduced SFR-DeepResearch, a framework for =
training a single LLM agent to conduct =E2=80=9Cdeep research=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=93 think of tasks like investigating a complex question by browsing, re=
asoning, and using tools, all autonomously. Unlike multi-agent systems wher=
e each agent has a fixed role, SFR-DeepResearch focuses on a single agent t=
hat decides on its own actions dynamically (what to read or which tool to r=
un next). The training approach keeps the model=E2=80=99s reasoning abiliti=
es sharp through continual RL fine-tuning on synthetic tasks designed to ex=
ercise complex reasoning. Using this method, they fine-tuned various open-s=
ource LLMs and found the agent improved notably in its research skills with=
out needing human demonstrations. Their best model, a 20B parameter LLM dub=

Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect=

Transformers normally use causal attention for text generation, meaning eac=
h token attends only to earlier tokens. CASTLE (CAuSal aTtention with Looka=
head kEys) is a new attention mechanism that cleverly injects information f=
rom future tokens into past tokens=E2=80=99 representations without breakin=
g the causal order. In standard attention, each token=E2=80=99s key (and va=
lue) is fixed once it=E2=80=99s created, encoding only the context up to th=
at token. CASTLE instead updates the keys of previous tokens as new tokens =
arrive, allowing past tokens to =E2=80=9Cknow=E2=80=9D about later context =
while still not letting a token see future content when generating. These a=
re called lookahead keys: they belong to an earlier position but include in=
fo from later positions (imagine a secret way for the model to consider lat=
er words in computing attention, yet the generation process remains autoreg=
ressive). The authors show mathematically that this can be implemented effi=
ciently in parallel (no need to literally recompute everything sequentially=
). On language modeling tasks, CASTLE consistently reduced perplexity and i=
mproved performance versus standard transformers at various model scales. I=
n essence, CASTLE gives transformers a form of hindsight during training =
=E2=80=93 a lookahead that helps each word=E2=80=99s representation become =
richer =E2=80=93 which translates to better predictions and understanding d=
uring generation. It=E2=80=99s a fresh architectural idea that could boost =
LLM quality by improving how they handle context.
Outcome-Based Exploration for LLM Reasoning (paper [ https://substack.com/r=

How an LLM is trained to search for correct answers can greatly affect its =
behavior. This paper identifies a pitfall in using RL for reasoning: reward=
ing only the correct final answer tends to collapse a model=E2=80=99s diver=
sity of thought. If a model is trained to just output the right answer, it =
might drop all alternative reasoning paths and become too single-minded =E2=
=80=93 good for straightforward accuracy, but bad when you rely on sampling=
 multiple solutions or creative problem-solving. The authors found that suc=
h outcome-based RL even reduced the diversity of answers on the training da=
ta compared to the base model, and this loss of diversity on easy problems =
carried over to harder ones. To fix this, they propose outcome-based explor=
ation: during RL fine-tuning, give the model extra reward for exploring dif=
ferent final answers. They implement two techniques: (1) Historical explora=
tion =E2=80=93 use a bonus (like a UCB bonus) for answers the model hasn=E2=
=80=99t given often before, to resurrect rare but possibly correct solution=
s; (2) Batch exploration =E2=80=93 during training, penalize the model if i=
t generates the same answer multiple times in a batch, forcing it to try va=
ried answers. Testing on competitive math problems with Llama and Qwen mode=
ls, these exploration bonuses improved accuracy while avoiding the collapse=
 in output diversity. In effect, the model learns to keep an open mind and =
consider multiple outcomes, which is crucial for reasoning tasks where we o=
ften want to sample different solution attempts. This work charts a path to=
 RL methods that boost solution quality and maintain creativity, instead of=
 sacrificing one for the other.
The Majority Is Not Always Right: Learning to Aggregate Solutions (paper [ =

IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
When faced with a hard question, a common trick is to have an LLM generate =
several independent answers and then pick the best one =E2=80=93 usually by=
 majority vote or a scoring model. But what if the most common answer is wr=
ong? This paper argues for a smarter approach: train a dedicated model to a=
ggregate multiple solutions using reasoning. Their system, called AggLM, ta=
kes a set of candidate answers and learns to review, cross-check, and recon=
cile them into a single final answer. Crucially, they train AggLM with RL u=
sing verifiable rewards (it gets positive feedback if the final answer is c=
orrect, which can often be checked in tasks like math). They also balance t=
he training data between =E2=80=9Ceasy=E2=80=9D cases (most answers are alr=
eady correct) and =E2=80=9Chard=E2=80=9D cases (only a minority are correct=
) so that the aggregator learns both to trust a consensus and to rescue a c=
orrect minority answer when needed. Experiments on various reasoning benchm=
arks show AggLM beats strong baselines like majority vote and single-soluti=
on reward rerankers. Impressively, it generalizes to aggregating outputs fr=
om models it never saw during training =E2=80=93 even stronger models =E2=
=80=93 indicating robust skills. And it achieves high accuracy with far few=
er total tokens than naive majority voting (which might require many candid=
ates). In summary, this work treats solution aggregation as a learnable ski=
ll: instead of assuming the majority is right, train an AI judge to do the =
wisdom-of-the-crowd more intelligently. The result is better answers from m=
ultiple attempts, moving beyond simple voting to a more nuanced synthesis.

Coding custom software for scientific experiments is a huge time sink for r=

elopment of high-quality scientific software for empirical research. The sy=
stem couples a Large Language Model with a tree search algorithm to iterati=
vely improve code towards maximizing a target metric (like accuracy of a mo=
del, etc.). Essentially, the LLM proposes code solutions, and tree search e=
xplores variations and improvements, guided by performance feedback. The re=
ally exciting part: the system not only writes solid code, it can invent ne=
w methods that outperform state-of-the-art human solutions. In bioinformati=
cs, it discovered 40 novel single-cell analysis techniques that beat the to=
p human-devised methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it genera=
ted 14 models for COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting that outdid the CDC=
=E2=80=99s ensemble model and all other submissions. It also produced state=
-of-the-art code for geospatial data analysis, neural activity prediction, =
time-series forecasting, and even numerical integration problems. These are=
n=E2=80=99t just minor tweaks =E2=80=93 they represent creative, expert-lev=
el advances, found autonomously by AI. By reading and integrating informati=
on from external sources (e.g. research papers or libraries), the system en=
hances its solutions. This work is a landmark in AI-for-science: it suggest=
s we can offload much of the grunt work of scientific programming to AI, an=
d in the process, AI might come up with ingenious solutions that speed up s=
cientific discovery. Truly a win-win for productivity and innovation.

of tasks like investigating a complex question by browsing, reasoning, and =

reasoning abilities sharp through continual RL fine-tuning on </span><em>sy=
nthetic tasks</em><span> designed to exercise complex reasoning. Using this=
 method, they fine-tuned various open-source LLMs and found the agent impro=
ved notably in its research skills without needing human demonstrations. Th=
eir best model, a 20B parameter LLM dubbed </span><strong>SFR-DR-20B</stron=

 =E2=80=9CHumanity=E2=80=99s Last Exam=E2=80=9D</strong><span> challenge. (=
For context, that benchmark poses college-level questions from many domains=
 =E2=80=93 so nearly 30% is a solid start for an autonomous AI researcher.)=
 The work provides insights from ablation studies and shows the promise of =
</span><strong>RL-trained single agents that can conduct multi-step reasoni=

><span>When faced with a hard question, a common trick is to have an LLM ge=
nerate several independent answers and then </span><strong>pick the best on=
e</strong><span> =E2=80=93 usually by majority vote or a scoring model. But=
 what if the most common answer is wrong? This paper argues for a smarter a=
pproach: </span><strong>train a dedicated model to aggregate multiple solut=
ions using reasoning</strong><span>. Their system, called </span><strong>Ag=
gLM</strong><span>, takes a set of candidate answers and learns to </span><=
strong>review, cross-check, and reconcile them into a single final answer</=
strong><span>. Crucially, they train AggLM with RL using </span><em>verifia=
ble rewards</em><span> (it gets positive feedback if the final answer is co=
rrect, which can often be checked in tasks like math). They also balance th=
e training data between =E2=80=9Ceasy=E2=80=9D cases (most answers are alre=
ady correct) and =E2=80=9Chard=E2=80=9D cases (only a minority are correct)=
 so that the aggregator learns both to </span><strong>trust a consensus and=
 to rescue a correct minority answer</strong><span> when needed. Experiment=
s on various reasoning benchmarks show AggLM </span><strong>beats strong ba=
selines</strong><span> like majority vote and single-solution reward rerank=
ers. Impressively, it generalizes to aggregating outputs from models </span=
><em>it never saw during training</em><span> =E2=80=93 even stronger models=
 =E2=80=93 indicating robust skills. And it achieves high accuracy with far=
 fewer total tokens than naive majority voting (which might require many ca=
ndidates). In summary, this work treats solution aggregation as a learnable=
 skill: </span><strong>instead of assuming the majority is right, train an =
AI judge to do the wisdom-of-the-crowd more intelligently</strong><span>. T=
he result is better answers from multiple attempts, moving beyond simple vo=
ting to a more nuanced synthesis.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post=

pan>Coding custom software for scientific experiments is a huge time sink f=
or researchers. Google DeepMind unveiled an AI system that can </span><stro=
ng>automate the development of high-quality scientific software</strong><sp=
an> for empirical research. The system couples a </span><strong>Large Langu=
age Model with a tree search algorithm</strong><span> to iteratively improv=
e code towards maximizing a target metric (like accuracy of a model, etc.).=
 Essentially, the LLM proposes code solutions, and tree search explores var=
iations and improvements, guided by performance feedback. The really exciti=
ng part: the system not only writes solid code, </span><strong>it can inven=
t new methods that outperform state-of-the-art human solutions</strong><spa=
n>. In bioinformatics, it discovered </span><strong>40 novel single-cell an=
alysis techniques</strong><span> that beat the top human-devised methods on=
 a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated </span><strong>14 mode=
ls for COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting</strong><span> that outdid the =
CDC=E2=80=99s ensemble model and all other submissions. It also produced st=
ate-of-the-art code for geospatial data analysis, neural activity predictio=
n, time-series forecasting, and even numerical integration problems. These =
aren=E2=80=99t just minor tweaks =E2=80=93 they represent </span><strong>cr=
eative, expert-level advances</strong><span>, found autonomously by AI. By =
reading and integrating information from external sources (e.g. research pa=
pers or libraries), the system enhances its solutions. This work is a landm=
ark in AI-for-science: it suggests we can </span><strong>offload much of th=
e grunt work of scientific programming to AI</strong><span>, and in the pro=
cess, AI might come up with ingenious solutions that speed up scientific di=
scovery. Truly a win-win for productivity and innovation.</span></p><div st=
