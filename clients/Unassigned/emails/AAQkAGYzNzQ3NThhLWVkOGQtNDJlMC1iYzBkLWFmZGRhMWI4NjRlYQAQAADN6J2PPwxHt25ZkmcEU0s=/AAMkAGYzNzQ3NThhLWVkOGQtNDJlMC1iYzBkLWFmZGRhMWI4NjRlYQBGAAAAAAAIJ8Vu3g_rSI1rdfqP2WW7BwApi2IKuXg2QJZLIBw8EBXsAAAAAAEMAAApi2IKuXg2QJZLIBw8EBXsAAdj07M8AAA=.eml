e-and-why-it-matters

Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
- System prompt: The initial instructions that tell an AI model how to beha=
ve throughout a conversation - like giving a new employee their job descrip=
tion
- Context engineering: The art of structuring information and instructions =
to get better AI outputs (evolved from "prompt engineering")
- Planning tools: Functions that help AI break down complex tasks into step=
s - sometimes just forcing it to think before acting
- Sub-agents: Specialized AI instances spawned to handle specific subtasks,=
 like hiring contractors for parts of a project
- No-op: A programming term for an operation that does nothing - like a "th=
ink about it" button that just makes you pause
Here's something that should sound familiar: the AI community has once agai=
n rebranded something we've been doing all along, and somehow, this time it=
 might actually matter. Remember when, just recently, "prompt engineering" =
suddenly became "context engineering"? Well, we're watching it happen again=
 with "deep agents."=20
But before you roll your eyes at yet another buzzword, let me tell you why =
this particular relabeling could represent something genuinely important - =
a qualitative shift in how we think about AI systems that mirrors other evo=
lutionary moments in computing.
The Pattern We Keep Missing
A recent LangChain blog post [ https://substack.com/redirect/c0a4284b-97bf-=
41e0-9e0f-dd854f5abbb2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] introduced the concept of "deep agents" along with a new =
library [ https://substack.com/redirect/a2d8975f-ec09-44b5-abbc-55e71e0744d=
1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], an=
d it simpy reflects a collective =E2=80=9Caha=E2=80=9D-moment a lot of rese=
archers and practicioners have been experiencing over the last months: Whil=
e everyone was obsessing over the latest models, it was actually the system=
s built around them that make all the difference.=20
You probably know the feeling - when you realize that what seems revolution=
ary is actually the natural convergence of tools we've had all along. It's =
like watching someone discover that peanut butter and chocolate taste good =
together. Of course they do. We just needed someone to point it out.
The components of a "deep agent" read like a grocery list of things we've b=
een using separately:
- A detailed system prompt (we've been crafting these since GPT-3)
- A planning tool (even if it's just a no-op that forces the model to think=
)
- Sub-agents for task delegation
- Access to a file system for memory and collaboration
Sound familiar? It should. Claude Code, OpenAI's Deep Research, and Manus a=
ren't doing anything magically new - they're mostly combining these ingredi=
ents in a way that suddenly makes agents feel, well, deeper.=20
Fun fact: The same can be said about the original ChatGPT. As Yann LeCun po=
inted out [ https://substack.com/redirect/0e3b7a9f-6cba-4eaa-81f4-b3f81efc3=
746?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] a=
t the time, there was =E2=80=9Cnothing revolutionary=E2=80=9D. And despite =
that, we all know by now how much of an impact ChatGPT had on the world of =
AI and beyond.
What "Deep" Actually Means
The shift from =E2=80=9Cshallow=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cdeep=E2=80=9D agents i=
s fundamentally about changing our approach. A shallow agent is like a smar=
t assistant who can only handle one request at a time: "Set a timer for 10 =
minutes." Done. Next request. It might take several steps to fulfill the ta=
sk, but it=E2=80=99s not deviating from its pretty straightforward workflow=
=2E A deep agent is more like a researc=
h assistant you'd actually want to hir=
e: give them a complex task, and they'll break it down, pursue multiple thr=
eads, take notes, and come back with something substantial.=20
What's been recognized is that the difference lies in the scaffolding aroun=
d the LLM. We're seeing context engineering principles applied to agent beh=
avior rather than individual prompts.
One could say that I just described a regular agent and that this has alway=
s been the baseline - and I wouldn't disagree. But with the rampant agentwa=
shing going on, it might not be the worst idea to have one more term to dif=
ferentiate more complex agents from all the rebranded chatbots. I know it c=
an be annoying, but I see it as the lesser evil.
The Todo List That Does Nothing (And Why That's All It Takes)
One particularly interesting detail from the deep agents implementation is =
the planning tool that literally =E2=80=9Cdoes nothing=E2=80=9D. Claude Cod=
e uses a "TodoWrite" tool that's just a no-op - it exists solely to force t=
he agent to articulate its plan. This is peak "working with AI" wisdom: som=
etimes the best tools are the ones that trick the model into better behavio=
r.
This reminds me of rubber duck debugging, where programmers explain their c=
ode to an inanimate object. The duck doesn't do anything, but the act of ex=
planation often reveals the solution. Deep agents sometimes use the same pr=
inciple - forcing structured thinking through tool use, even when the tool =
itself is meaningless. Of course, the next step would be to come up with to=
oling that adds to this process. But if all it takes to get 0 to 80% is =E2=
=80=9Cnothing=E2=80=9D, then that seems like a great start. A practical way=
 to look at this is viewing it as a quick reminder in a stressful situation=
=2E You might be a great performer o=
n stage, but there=E2=80=99s always a cha=
nce that you will forget your lines - and that=E2=80=99s what prompters are=
 for.=20
What This Means for the Rest of Us
Here's where it gets interesting for anyone building with AI. The emergence=
 of deep agents signals that we've crossed a threshold in system design sop=
histication. The models haven't suddenly gotten smarter, we've gotten bette=
r at making them useful.
Think about it this way: we've had all the ingredients for French cooking f=
or centuries, but it took someone to write down the recipes and techniques =
before everyone could make a decent b=C3=A9arnaise. Deep agents are similar=
 - they're a recipe for combining tools we already have into something more=
 powerful than the sum of its parts.
The Real Innovation Is the Mindset
What=E2=80=99s most interesting to the engineers among us is what it repres=
ents about our growing sophistication in working with AI. We're moving from=
 "what can this model do?" to "how can we orchestrate multiple models and t=
ools to accomplish complex goals?"
The fact that an open-source framework can be built over a weekend that rep=
licates much of what the best available tools (e.g., Claude Code) are doing=
 tells you everything you need to know. This is about design patterns that =
anyone can implement, not proprietary breakthroughs. Obviously, this is oft=

So What Should You Do?
If you're building with AI, the lesson is clear: stop thinking about indivi=
dual model capabilities and start thinking about systems. The winners in th=
e AI application space won't be those with access to the best models (those=
 are increasingly commoditized), but those who best understand how to combi=
ne simple components into sophisticated behaviors.
Try this experiment: take any complex task you currently do manually and br=
eak it down into steps a patient but not-too-bright assistant could follow.=
 Add a planning phase, some way to take notes, and the ability to delegate =
subtasks. Congratulations - you've just designed a deep agent.
The tools are all there. We just needed someone to point out that they tast=
e good together.
The shift from shallow to deep agents is less a technological revolution an=
d more a collective "aha" moment about system design. Like the evolution fr=
om prompt to context engineering, it's a recognition that the real gains co=
me not from better models, but from better ways of using them. And that's s=
omething we can all participate in, starting today.

x;font-size: 16px;">The shift from =E2=80=9Cshallow=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cde=
ep=E2=80=9D agents is fundamentally about changing our approach. A shallow =
agent is like a smart assistant who can only handle one request at a time: =
&quot;Set a timer for 10 minutes.&quot; Done. Next request. It might take s=
everal steps to fulfill the task, but it=E2=80=99s not deviating from its p=
retty straightforward workflow. A deep agent is more like a research assist=
ant you'd actually want to hire: give them a complex task, and they'll brea=
k it down, pursue multiple threads, take notes, and come back with somethin=
g substantial. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">One particularly interesting detail from the deep agents implemen=
tation is the planning tool that literally =E2=80=9Cdoes nothing=E2=80=9D. =
Claude Code uses a &quot;TodoWrite&quot; tool that's just a no-op - it exis=
ts solely to force the agent to articulate its plan. This is peak &quot;wor=
king with AI&quot; wisdom: sometimes the best tools are the ones that trick=
 the model into better behavior.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This reminds me of rubber =
duck debugging, where programmers explain their code to an inanimate object=
. The duck doesn't do anything, but the act of explanation often reveals th=
e solution. Deep agents sometimes use the same principle - forcing structur=
ed thinking through tool use, even when the tool itself is meaningless. Of =
course, the next step would be to come up with tooling that adds to this pr=
ocess. But if all it takes to get 0 to 80% is =E2=80=9Cnothing=E2=80=9D, th=
en that seems like a great start. A practical way to look at this is viewin=
g it as a quick reminder in a stressful situation. You might be a great per=
former on stage, but there=E2=80=99s always a chance that you will forget y=
our lines - and that=E2=80=99s what prompters are for. </p><h2 class=3D"hea=
