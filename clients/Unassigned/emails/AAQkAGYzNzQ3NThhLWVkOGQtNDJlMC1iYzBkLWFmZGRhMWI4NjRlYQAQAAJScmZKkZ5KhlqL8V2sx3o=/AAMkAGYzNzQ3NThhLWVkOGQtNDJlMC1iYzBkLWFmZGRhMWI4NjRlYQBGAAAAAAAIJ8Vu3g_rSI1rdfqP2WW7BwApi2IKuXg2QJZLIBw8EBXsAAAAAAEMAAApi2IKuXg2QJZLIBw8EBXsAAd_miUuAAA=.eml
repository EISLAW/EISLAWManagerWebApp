WHEN RIVERS BECOME RED LINES [3]
SCALE AND URGENCY HAVE HEIGHTENED THE IMPORTANCE OF CERTAIN WATER RESOURCES.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
Societies have tried to control resources as long as there have been resources to control. Whether precious metals, arable lands or hydrocarbon deposits, access to resources shapes military postures,
influences political alliances and sets foreign policies – even in 2025. If anything, the scale and urgency of modern operations have made resources all the more critical: The scale of new projects
means that the competition over certain resources is often a global rather than a local affair, and the urgency with which some countries need resources is often a matter of national interest.
Such is the case with inland water systems. At the core is a fixed reality: Rivers lock states into upstream and downstream positions. Control of headwaters confers leverage; dependence on their flow
creates vulnerability. Mega-dams and diversions amplify this disparity, giving upstream states tools of control and leaving downstream states exposed to decisions made beyond their borders. Geography
only makes matters worse, for basins cannot be redrawn, and survival strategies must adapt to fixed upstream-downstream positions.
Military strategy follows a similar logic. Water infrastructure is openly treated as strategic terrain. Dams and diversions are defended with garrisons, air defenses and forward deployments, yet
remain exposed targets. Unlike mobile assets, dams are fixed. River diversions cannot be hidden. Their very permanence makes them at once strategic assets and liabilities. In Ukraine, for example, the
destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in 2023 showed how rivers can be weaponized by flooding terrain, cutting supply and destabilizing civilian populations.
The United States Institute of Peace notes that out of all the recorded incidents targeting water infrastructure over the last 2,000 years, 41 percent have occurred since 2020. The surge reflects two
converging dynamics: the long-range strike capabilities of modern militaries and the multifaceted nature of infrastructure. This elevates dams and diversions to high-value military targets. Militaries
now integrate their defense directly into operational planning, from air defense rings and cyber hardening to contingency plans for rapid strikes. As a result, water control isn’t just a factor in
development policy; it’s fundamentally embedded into military deterrence and force posture.
Military application reinforces the geographic divide. Upstream countries are compelled to secure water and electricity for growing populations, and they can wield control of flows as a coercive tool.
Upstream states typically reinforce control with military assets, securing headwaters and guarding major dam complexes. For downstream states, water is often framed as an existential issue.
Agriculture, food supply and electricity depend on water they cannot control. This dependency drives them to seek outside allies, deploy troops to vulnerable borders and frame interference with river
flows as a red line for potential escalation.
It makes sense that dams would require military defense. They serve a variety of functions by concentrating water, power and infrastructure into a single, highly targetable site. Unlike oil, water
cannot be stockpiled at scale or transported freely. Reservoirs can buffer flows, but storage is limited, leaky and vulnerable to drought. And when rainfall is erratic, even upstream states lose the
ability to control flows reliably.
The result is structural. Engineering projects and military deployments reinforce each other, but neither can resolve disputes outright. Escalation – airstrikes on dams, forward deployments or flow
manipulation – carries inherent risks of destabilization.
Several case studies illustrate the dynamics at play, perhaps none clearer than the Indus River, where India’s upstream control collides directly with Pakistan’s downstream survival. The Indus
supplies more than 80 percent of the water Pakistan uses to irrigate its crops and more than 50 percent of its electricity generation. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty in April marked a
shift from diplomacy to coercion. In the wake of the incident in Pahalgam – where a proxy of a Pakistan-based terrorist organization attacked sites in India-controlled Kashmir – New Delhi
fast-tracked hydropower and irrigation infrastructure on the western Indus tributaries, announcing accelerated timelines for four mega-dams on the Chenab River and planning expanded canal networks on
the Jhelum and Sutlej rivers. Pakistan responded with nuclear-coded rhetoric, warning of strikes on new Indian dams. What had been the world’s most enduring water-sharing agreement has collapsed
into deterrence by infrastructure. The result is not resolution but a locked-in escalatory pattern in which every successive Kashmir flare-up risks pulling water projects into the confrontation,
making dams and canals permanent triggers in the rivalry.
Then there is the case of the Brahmaputra River. Here, China’s control of the upper Yarlung Tsangpo leaves India in the downstream position, with no treaty framework to moderate the relationship.
The absence of rules heightens India’s vulnerability. China’s leverage is political as well as hydrological: Dam announcements can be timed as pressure points in wider disputes, including border
negotiations. The recent China-India dialogue [4] has eased other frictions, but without a basin treaty, water remains a structural vulnerability.
A similar asymmetry of control and dependence can be seen in the Tigris–Euphrates basin. Turkey’s Southeastern Anatolia Project secures irrigation and energy at home but has cut flows into Iraq by
more than a quarter, causing electricity shortages and crop failures. In Basra, water scarcity was one of the sparks that ignited mass protests, and similar unrest has recurred in Baghdad and the
south. In Syria, reduced releases from the Euphrates compound humanitarian crises brought on by years of war, leaving towns with failing irrigation and supply systems.
Scientific assessments estimate that roughly 30 percent of Turkey’s territory, particularly in central and southeastern Anatolia, faces a high risk of desertification. Broader United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification reporting places the “at risk” category much higher (though with looser definitions) at up to 88 percent. Reservoirs in key provinces are already running dry.
Ankara’s need to secure water for its own population intensifies the squeeze downstream, where scarcity translates directly into unrest. Its forward presence in northern Syria and Iraq underscores
how water management and military posture reinforce each other. Crucially, the water that gives Turkey leverage also ties its stability to unstable neighbors: A collapse in Iraq or Syria would surely
spill over. This makes Ankara’s water posture not just a tool of influence but also a structural liability shaping its long-term strategy. Turkey’s forward presence will likely become a
semi-permanent posture, one meant not just to counter militias and Kurdish groups but also to manage flows that bind its own stability to the fate of Iraq and Syria.
Elsewhere, drought in Iran has left reservoirs near empty and has triggered recurring protests, while the Helmand River dispute with Afghanistan compounds pressures in the southeast. In Egypt, the
Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is treated as a matter of life or death. Officials there warn that force remains an option if downstream flow is cut. Each drought season will reopen brinkmanship over
the GERD, keeping military options in play even if direct conflict remains unlikely. For Tehran, water scarcity is as much a domestic stability risk as an external one, making future protests and
border flare-ups more likely than resolution. For both, water scarcity magnifies domestic fragility as much as interstate risk.
In Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan depend on Kyrgyz and Tajik headwaters – now shaped by Chinese-built dams without the Soviet-era mechanisms that once balanced flows. In the Western
Hemisphere, disputes in the La Plata basin in South America and along the U.S.-Mexico border reveal how scarcity strains cross-border relations. These disputes have led to arbitration and periodic
diplomatic strains, even if they fall well short of militarization. Taken together, these cases show how water disputes move from local grievances to structural constraints, setting the stage for
broader patterns visible across history.
The bottom line is that while disputes over water resources are eternal, today’s mega-dams, climate volatility and great power competition magnify their importance. As a result, river basins are
hardening into military frontiers. For militaries, dams and headwaters now function like strategic chokepoints, no less significant than straits or mountain passes. For outside powers, they are no
longer peripheral: The U.S., Russia and China must now factor basins into intervention scenarios and alliance planning, much as they do with maritime routes. Cooperation and arbitration may delay
crises, but they cannot erase the geography that locks states into conflict.
The greater risk is not gradual decline but sudden rupture: a drought, a dam failure or a deliberate cutoff cascading into regional escalation. Water is a structural fault line – slow to shift but
capable of triggering a sudden crisis when red lines are crossed.

														</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Societies have tri=
ed to control resources as long as there have been resources to control. Wh=
ether precious metals, arable lands or hydrocarbon deposits, access to reso=
urces shapes military postures, influences political alliances and sets for=
eign policies =E2=80=93 even in 2025. If anything, the scale and urgency of=
 modern operations have made resources all the more critical: The scale of =
new projects means that the competition over certain resources is often a g=
lobal rather than a local affair, and the urgency with which some countries=
 need resources is often a matter of national interest.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Such is the case w=
ith inland water systems. At the core is a fixed reality: Rivers lock state=
s into upstream and downstream positions. Control of headwaters confers lev=
erage; dependence on their flow creates vulnerability. Mega-dams and divers=
ions amplify this disparity, giving upstream states tools of control and le=
aving downstream states exposed to decisions made beyond their borders. Geo=
graphy only makes matters worse, for basins cannot be redrawn, and survival=
 strategies must adapt to fixed upstream-downstream positions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Military strategy =
follows a similar logic. Water infrastructure is openly treated as strategi=
c terrain. Dams and diversions are defended with garrisons, air defenses an=
d forward deployments, yet remain exposed targets. Unlike mobile assets, da=
ms are fixed. River diversions cannot be hidden. Their very permanence make=
s them at once strategic assets and liabilities. In Ukraine, for example, t=
he destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in 2023 showed how rivers can be weaponi=
zed by flooding terrain, cutting supply and destabilizing civilian populati=
ons.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The United States =
Institute of Peace notes that out of all the recorded incidents targeting w=
ater infrastructure over the last 2,000 years, 41 percent have occurred sin=
ce 2020. The surge reflects two converging dynamics: the long-range strike =
capabilities of modern militaries and the multifaceted nature of infrastruc=
ture. This elevates dams and diversions to high-value military targets. Mil=
itaries now integrate their defense directly into operational planning, fro=
m air defense rings and cyber hardening to contingency plans for rapid stri=
kes. As a result, water control isn=E2=80=99t just a factor in development =
policy; it=E2=80=99s fundamentally embedded into military deterrence and fo=
rce posture.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Military applicati=
on reinforces the geographic divide. Upstream countries are compelled to se=
cure water and electricity for growing populations, and they can wield cont=
rol of flows as a coercive tool. Upstream states typically reinforce contro=
l with military assets, securing headwaters and guarding major dam complexe=
s. For downstream states, water is often framed as an existential issue. Ag=
riculture, food supply and electricity depend on water they cannot control.=
 This dependency drives them to seek outside allies, deploy troops to vulne=
rable borders and frame interference with river flows as a red line for pot=
ential escalation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It makes sense tha=
t dams would require military defense. They serve a variety of functions by=
 concentrating water, power and infrastructure into a single, highly target=
able site. Unlike oil, water cannot be stockpiled at scale or transported f=
reely. Reservoirs can buffer flows, but storage is limited, leaky and vulne=
rable to drought. And when rainfall is erratic, even upstream states lose t=
he ability to control flows reliably.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The result is stru=
ctural. Engineering projects and military deployments reinforce each other,=
 but neither can resolve disputes outright. Escalation =E2=80=93 airstrikes=
 on dams, forward deployments or flow manipulation =E2=80=93 carries inhere=
nt risks of destabilization.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Several case studi=
es illustrate the dynamics at play, perhaps none clearer than the Indus Riv=
er, where India=E2=80=99s upstream control collides directly with Pakistan=
=E2=80=99s downstream survival. The Indus supplies more than 80 percent of =
the water Pakistan uses to irrigate its crops and more than 50 percent of i=
ts electricity generation. India=E2=80=99s suspension of the Indus Waters T=
reaty in April marked a shift from diplomacy to coercion. In the wake of th=
e incident in Pahalgam =E2=80=93 where a proxy of a Pakistan-based terroris=
t organization attacked sites in India-controlled Kashmir =E2=80=93 New Del=
hi fast-tracked hydropower and irrigation infrastructure on the western Ind=
us tributaries, announcing accelerated timelines for four mega-dams on the =
Chenab River and planning expanded canal networks on the Jhelum and Sutlej =
rivers. Pakistan responded with nuclear-coded rhetoric, warning of strikes =
on new Indian dams. What had been the world=E2=80=99s most enduring water-s=
haring agreement has collapsed into deterrence by infrastructure. The resul=
t is not resolution but a locked-in escalatory pattern in which every succe=
ssive Kashmir flare-up risks pulling water projects into the confrontation,=
 making dams and canals permanent triggers in the rivalry.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Then there is the =
case of the Brahmaputra River. Here, China=E2=80=99s control of the upper Y=
arlung Tsangpo leaves India in the downstream position, with no treaty fram=
ework to moderate the relationship. The absence of rules heightens India=E2=
=80=99s vulnerability. China=E2=80=99s leverage is political as well as hyd=
rological: Dam announcements can be timed as pressure points in wider dispu=
tes, including border negotiations. The recent <a href=3D"https://geopoliti=

F0ZWdpZXMv" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">Ch=
ina-India dialogue</a>&nbsp;has eased other frictions, but without a basin =
treaty, water remains a structural vulnerability.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A similar asymmetr=
y of control and dependence can be seen in the Tigris=E2=80=93Euphrates bas=
in. Turkey=E2=80=99s Southeastern Anatolia Project secures irrigation and e=
nergy at home but has cut flows into Iraq by more than a quarter, causing e=
lectricity shortages and crop failures. In Basra, water scarcity was one of=
 the sparks that ignited mass protests, and similar unrest has recurred in =
Baghdad and the south. In Syria, reduced releases from the Euphrates compou=
nd humanitarian crises brought on by years of war, leaving towns with faili=
ng irrigation and supply systems.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Scientific assessm=
ents estimate that roughly 30 percent of Turkey=E2=80=99s territory, partic=
ularly in central and southeastern Anatolia, faces a high risk of desertifi=
cation. Broader United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification reporti=
ng places the =E2=80=9Cat risk=E2=80=9D category much higher (though with l=
ooser definitions) at up to 88 percent. Reservoirs in key provinces are alr=
eady running dry. Ankara=E2=80=99s need to secure water for its own populat=
ion intensifies the squeeze downstream, where scarcity translates directly =
into unrest. Its forward presence in northern Syria and Iraq underscores ho=
w water management and military posture reinforce each other. Crucially, th=
e water that gives Turkey leverage also ties its stability to unstable neig=
hbors: A collapse in Iraq or Syria would surely spill over. This makes Anka=
ra=E2=80=99s water posture not just a tool of influence but also a structur=
al liability shaping its long-term strategy. Turkey=E2=80=99s forward prese=
nce will likely become a semi-permanent posture, one meant not just to coun=
ter militias and Kurdish groups but also to manage flows that bind its own =
stability to the fate of Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Elsewhere, drought=
 in Iran has left reservoirs near empty and has triggered recurring protest=
s, while the Helmand River dispute with Afghanistan compounds pressures in =
the southeast. In Egypt, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is treated as =
a matter of life or death. Officials there warn that force remains an optio=
n if downstream flow is cut. Each drought season will reopen brinkmanship o=
ver the GERD, keeping military options in play even if direct conflict rema=
ins unlikely. For Tehran, water scarcity is as much a domestic stability ri=
sk as an external one, making future protests and border flare-ups more lik=
ely than resolution. For both, water scarcity magnifies domestic fragility =
as much as interstate risk.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Central Asia, K=
azakhstan and Uzbekistan depend on Kyrgyz and Tajik headwaters =E2=80=93 no=
w shaped by Chinese-built dams without the Soviet-era mechanisms that once =
balanced flows. In the Western Hemisphere, disputes in the La Plata basin i=
n South America and along the U.S.-Mexico border reveal how scarcity strain=
s cross-border relations. These disputes have led to arbitration and period=
ic diplomatic strains, even if they fall well short of militarization. Take=
n together, these cases show how water disputes move from local grievances =
to structural constraints, setting the stage for broader patterns visible a=
cross history.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The bottom line is=
 that while disputes over water resources are eternal, today=E2=80=99s mega=
-dams, climate volatility and great power competition magnify their importa=
nce. As a result, river basins are hardening into military frontiers. For m=
ilitaries, dams and headwaters now function like strategic chokepoints, no =
less significant than straits or mountain passes. For outside powers, they =
are no longer peripheral: The U.S., Russia and China must now factor basins=
 into intervention scenarios and alliance planning, much as they do with ma=
ritime routes. Cooperation and arbitration may delay crises, but they canno=
t erase the geography that locks states into conflict.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The greater risk i=
s not gradual decline but sudden rupture: a drought, a dam failure or a del=
iberate cutoff cascading into regional escalation. Water is a structural fa=
ult line =E2=80=93 slow to shift but capable of triggering a sudden crisis =
when red lines are crossed.</p>
