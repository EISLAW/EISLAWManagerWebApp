Yes yes the pun is awful lol
I feel like only developers talk about evals. And the rest of us are missin=
g out.
Because we hear =E2=80=9Cevaluation=E2=80=9D and we think =E2=80=9Cboring d=
eveloper test" when we should be thinking =E2=80=9Chey I=E2=80=99d like to =
not have catastrophic business risk from AI.=E2=80=9D
Yes, it=E2=80=99s that serious. Don=E2=80=99t believe me? Check out the bil=
lions evaporated by eval-related issues in this table [ https://substack.co=
m/redirect/3377bf3f-c028-43e8-b084-9346fa3c88f7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdz=
y88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
Very large companies that had very public eval-related issues=E2=80=A6
Now you might be tempted to throw up your hands and say: =E2=80=9CIf public=
ly traded companies screw this up, how can we hope to get it right? Why bot=
her?=E2=80=9D
I will tell you: the answer to =E2=80=9Cevals are hard and risk is high=E2=
=80=9D is not =E2=80=9Cwe shouldn=E2=80=99t do evals.=E2=80=9D Risk with sm=
arter systems is high enough that working on evals is important even if you=
 know they are not perfect. You=E2=80=99d rather some less risk than be ful=
l risk-on and just YOLO your prompts into the void. Would you let your soft=
ware team just yeet stuff into production at 4:30 PM on a Friday with zero =
testing?=20
Same deal here. Evals matter. Read on for a practical way to go from panic =
to productive with your eval setup, including a framework to assess risk an=
d eval how-to=E2=80=99s matched to various risk profiles. You know, the kin=
d of nerdy stuff that makes my nerdy heart sing lol
Subscribers get all these pieces!
2 a.m. Your phone lights up: the new =E2=80=9CAI=E2=80=91powered=E2=80=9D b=
illing system just sent twenty customers invoices that are off by a whole z=
ero=E2=80=94about $320k evaporated in one click. Yesterday=E2=80=99s launch=
 deck bragged the same model placed top=E2=80=9110=E2=80=AF% on a public ba=
r=E2=80=91exam test. Academic bragging rights don=E2=80=99t cover real=E2=
=80=91world liability=E2=80=94ask Air Canada, whose chatbot=E2=80=99s made=

Thesis
Slide=E2=80=91worthy benchmark scores aren=E2=80=99t guardrails for your re=
venue, latency, or legal exposure. This guide takes you on a four=E2=80=91s=
top Eval=E2=80=91Adventure=E2=80=94Extraction Alley, Latency & Cost Bypass,=
 RAG Boulevard, and Compliance Crossing=E2=80=94so you can bolt the right, =
context=E2=80=91specific tests onto your stack before the next 2=E2=80=AFa.=
m. wake=E2=80=91up.
Overhead Map =E2=80=94 find your quadrant
So let=E2=80=99s not hide the good stuff here. I=E2=80=99m presenting a qua=
drant structure to help you evaluate your AI eval needs. I will get into wh=
at all these mean in a moment, but for now just admire this pretty chart ma=
pping evals to business risk and output format.
So what do these quadrants mean? Here=E2=80=99s a TLDR:
TLDR for skimmers:=20
Top row=E2=80=AF=3D=E2=80=AFhigher risk, loop Legal/Data=E2=80=91Sec in
Bottom row =3D=E2=80=AF, lower risk grab=E2=80=91and=E2=80=91go demos
Find your quadrant, then read the matching stop for code, cost math, and go=
tchas
Stop #1 =E2=80=94 Extraction Alley
Structured output =E2=80=A2 High business risk
Ok let=E2=80=99s go on a tour! Our first stop is Extraction Alley. Think of=
 it as the place where you need to be absolutely sure the data outputs are =
correct, and it=E2=80=99s really a function of aligning outputs to low-tole=
rance downstream systems that only tolerate data that is both correct and c=
orrectly formatted.
What it is =E2=80=94 in plain English
An extraction evaluation checks that the model=E2=80=99s answer follows the=
 exact format your downstream systems demand. Think of it as a unit test fo=
r numbers, dates, IDs, or JSON. If the shape is wrong, even a =E2=80=9Ccorr=
ect=E2=80=9D answer can crash billing pipelines or BI dashboards.
Why it matters
Miss-formatted data rarely throws an error=E2=80=94it just flows quietly in=
to revenue reports, refunds, or compliance audits. One wrong decimal can er=
ase a week of profit.
Cautionary tale
Imagine=E2=80=A6 a nutrition app lets its LLM read grocery receipts. An OCR=
 glitch turns =E2=80=9C$12.50=E2=80=9D into =E2=80=9C$1250.00=E2=80=9D for =
200 users. No big deal right? It=E2=80=99s not the actual calories. Well=E2=
=80=A6not so fast. It turns out your team was trusting that total number as=
 a measure of the total amount of food bought. Now calories blow up, none o=
f your customers can figure out why their calorie budgets are broken, churn=
 goes through the roof, cashflow falls, and you have a crisis on your hands=
=2E When you investigate, the team h=
ad skipped format tests because =E2=80=9C=
the model scores well on public math benchmarks.=E2=80=9D
How might this have gone differently?
How the eval works
Sample 100 real receipts (or realistic synthetic ones).
Assert a rule like =E2=80=9Ctotal must match ^\d{1,4}\.\d{2}\sUSD$=E2=80=9D=
=2E
Fail the deploy if fewer than 99 % of answers pass that rule.

What a non-technical leader can do
Declare the =E2=80=9Ccritical fields.=E2=80=9D Totals, dates, IDs=E2=80=94w=
hatever would be catastrophic if wrong.
Set the go/no-go bar. For money fields: =E2=80=9CAnything below 99 % pass-r=

Monday-morning builder checklist
Pull 100 live examples & hand-label totals.
Add the 4-line regex metric to OpenAI Evals (or DeepEval).
Plug a =E2=80=9Cblock-merge-if-fail=E2=80=9D step into GitHub Actions.
Revisit the 99 % threshold quarterly as volume grows.
Takeaway: A tiny regex gate catches six-figure mistakes long before Finance=
=E2=80=94or Twitter=E2=80=94does.
Stop #2 =E2=80=94 Latency & Cost Bypass
Structured output =E2=80=A2 Low intrinsic risk, high margin impact
Next, let's stop at Latency & Cost Bypass. This one doesn=E2=80=99t seem so=
 bad at first glance, but the lack of frontline legal liability can be dece=
ptive=E2=80=94fundamentally this is about evaluating structured outputs in =
a rigorous way to ensure a consistent cost profile.
What it is =E2=80=94 in plain English
A latency-and-cost evaluation records two numbers for every model call:
p95 latency (speed for the slowest 5 % of calls).
Cost per call (tokens =C3=97 $ per token).
The deploy fails if either number exceeds your budget.
Why it matters
Each extra 100 ms on checkout drops conversion ~5 %.
A =E2=80=9Charmless=E2=80=9D prompt tweak can add another LLM round-trip an=
d 10=C3=97 your cloud bill overnight.
Cautionary tale
Imagine=E2=80=A6A fintech chatbot inserted a =E2=80=9Cthink-step=E2=80=9D i=
nto its prompt. Latency spiked from 120 ms to 820 ms; spend shot to $4 000/=
day. Users abandoned mid-flow; the CFO saw the AWS invoice before anyone el=
se noticed.
How the eval works
Snapshot 50=E2=80=93100 top-traffic prompts nightly.
Record latency with time.perf_counter() and cost from the token counts the =
API returns.
Block merges if p95 > 200 ms or cost > $0.001.
Minimal metric definition (5 lines)
yaml

metrics: - name: latency_p95 # threshold_ms: 200 - name: cost_usd # max_usd=
: 0.001
What a non-technical leader can do
Define clear SLAs. =E2=80=9CAnswers must land in < 300 ms=E2=80=9D translat=
es tech speed into business risk.
Own the cost ceiling. Agree on the maximum $ per 1 000 calls the margin can=
 absorb.
Review a weekly dashboard. One chart: p95 latency; one: total spend.
Treat breaches like uptime incidents. Require a post-mortem and rollback pl=
an.
Monday-morning builder checklist
Wrap calls with a 2-line timer; log token costs.
Fail CI if p95 > 200 ms or cost > $0.001.
Pipe daily metrics to Slack for visibility.
Tune thresholds monthly as pricing or traffic changes.
Takeaway: Automated speed-and-spend gates protect conversion and gross marg=
in=E2=80=94no CFO surprises required.
Stop #3 =E2=80=94 RAG Boulevard
Free-form output =C2=B7 Moderate risk (truthfulness & citations)
This one is brutally hard to evaluate, and it can be tempting to skip it or=
 go light here. It=E2=80=99s hard to know when a RAG output is correct (dat=
a is very free-form), and since there is often not massive compliance risk =
here you can be tempted to just let it go. Don=E2=80=99t. Getting it right =
is one way you can drive reliability in a world of half-assed LLM applicati=
ons.
What it is =E2=80=93 in plain English
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: the model first pulls snippe=
ts from your knowledge base and then composes an answer that should stay fa=
ithful to those snippets=E2=80=94and should cite them. A RAG eval checks tw=
o things:
Faithfulness =E2=80=94 does the answer stick to retrieved text, or hallucin=
ate?
Citation quality =E2=80=94 do the cited snippets actually support the answe=
r?
Why it matters
Users trust answers that show receipts. If the citations are wrong=E2=80=94=
or missing=E2=80=94confidence tanks, support tickets spike, and brand credi=
bility erodes.
Cautionary tale
Imagine=E2=80=A6A SaaS help-center bot used RAG on its docs. A broken retri=
ever served an old pricing page; the bot assured prospects that upgrades we=
re free. Dozens of angry =E2=80=9Cbait-and-switch=E2=80=9D reviews later, t=
he team discovered their RAG pipeline had no faithfulness test=E2=80=94just=
 uptime checks.
How the eval works
Curate 50=E2=80=93100 real user questions with their ground-truth answers.
Run the RAG pipeline in CI.
Score each response with RAGAS (or DeepEval) for answer_faithfulness and co=
ntext_precision.
Fail the deploy if faithfulness < 0.8 or context precision < 0.7.
Minimal metric (5 lines)
yaml

metrics: - name: answer_faithfulness # threshold: 0.8 - name: context_preci=
sion # threshold: 0.7
What a non-technical leader can do
Flag =E2=80=9Cmust-cite=E2=80=9D sources. Docs, T&Cs, pricing=E2=80=94defin=
e what must appear in citations.
Set the trust bar. e.g., =E2=80=9CAny answer with faithfulness < 0.8 rolls =

Review a monthly hallucination log. Top five fails, impact, fix status.
Schedule spot-checks. Read three bot answers a week; verify citations manua=
lly.
Monday-morning quick wins for builders
Export 50 recent support queries + correct answers.
pip install ragas and wrap the pipeline with its CLI.
Fail CI if faithfulness < 0.8 or context precision < 0.7.

your cheapest insurance against public hallucination fiascos.
Stop #4 =E2=80=94 Compliance Crossing
Free-form output =C2=B7 High legal and reputational risk
Ok, people sort of get why you have to do evals here. This is where the sca=
ry legal risk comes in. But most of the time even here people settle for in=
adequate safeguards. In this case =E2=80=9Clegal says it=E2=80=99s probably=
 fine=E2=80=9D is just an invitation to a problem. Legal has no idea that t=
hese LLMs are going to generate different probabilistic answers in one of a=
 100 different cases. And they tested 2 of them.
What it is =E2=80=93 in plain English
A compliance evaluation asks: =E2=80=9CDoes the model ever say something th=
at breaks policy, law, or brand safety?=E2=80=9D It probes for hate speech,=
 PII leaks, jailbreaks, or unapproved advice. The test is usually run in tw=
o modes:
Red-team prompts =E2=80=94 deliberately abusive or manipulative inputs.
Policy rubric =E2=80=94 an LLM (or human) grades each response for safety a=
nd compliance.
Why it matters
One rogue reply can trigger lawsuits, regulator attention, or front-page he=
adlines. Unlike latency or accuracy bugs, compliance failures can=E2=80=99t=
 be rolled back quietly=E2=80=94they live forever on screenshots.
Cautionary tale
Imagine=E2=80=A6A legal-advice chatbot was fine in demos but, under subtle =
prompts, produced immigration instructions that violated federal law. The c=
ompany was fined and forced to add a manual review layer because no automat=
ed policy gate was in place.
How the eval works
Compile a red-team prompt set: hate speech, PII requests, jailbreak pattern=
s.
Generate model responses in CI.
Score each with a policy rubric=E2=80=94OpenAI =E2=80=9Charmlessness=E2=80=
=9D or a custom safety model.
Fail the deploy if safety < 0.9 or harmful content detected.
Minimal metric (5 lines)
yaml

metrics: - name: policy_harmlessness # threshold: 0.90 - name: disallowed_c=
ontent # threshold: 0
What a non-technical leader can do
Define the red lines. List forbidden topics, words, or data types (e.g., he=
alth advice, SSNs).
Own the safety threshold. Decide =E2=80=9CAnything below 0.9 safety blocks =
release.=E2=80=9D
Review monthly incident reports. How many prompts failed, what was fixed, E=
TA on new tests.
Coordinate with Legal & PR. Pre-draft escalation playbooks for worst-case l=
eaks.
Monday-morning quick wins for builders
Start with OpenAI=E2=80=99s public =E2=80=9Cjailbreak=E2=80=9D list or Prom=
ptfoo=E2=80=99s red-team suite.
Pipe responses through the safety rubric in your eval harness.
Block merges on safety < 0.9 or any disallowed content.
Run the suite nightly; add new edge-case prompts after each incident.
Takeaway: Compliance gates turn potential headline disasters into low-risk,=
 testable failures=E2=80=94saving lawyers, PR teams, and your brand from fi=
refighting later.
Stop #5 =E2=80=94 Agentic Outskirts
Multi-turn agents =C2=B7 Highest complexity, cascading risk
Yep bonus section! This wasn=E2=80=99t on that quadrant map. Agentic system=
s need their own risk profiles, but we talk about them enough I wanted to i=
nclude a short section here. Fundamentally, you need to view agentic risk a=
s combinatorial=E2=80=94risks multiply as multi-agent scenarios develop, th=
ey don=E2=80=99t just add.=20
What it is =E2=80=93 in plain English
An agentic workflow is a model that thinks and acts in multiple steps: it p=
lans, invokes tools or APIs, reads the results, and loops until it believes=
 the job is done. Evaluating an agent means testing the whole mission, not =
just a single answer. You care about two layers:
Macro success =E2=80=94 Did the agent achieve the user=E2=80=99s goal?
Micro safety & efficiency =E2=80=94 Were any steps unsafe, wasteful, or off=
-policy?
Why it matters
Errors can snowball. A single bad decision early in the chain can trigger f=
ive API calls, rack up cost, or even delete data. Because traces are long, =
bugs stay invisible until the agent wreaks real-world havoc.
Cautionary tale
Imagine=E2=80=A6A customer-support agent was tasked with closing tickets au=
tomatically. During a weekend beta it hit the =E2=80=9Cescalate=E2=80=9D en=
dpoint on every unresolved case, flooding human reps and sending apology cr=
edits to 8000 users. Root cause: its success metric checked only ticket clo=
sure, not the quality of the resolution path.
How the eval works
Record full traces (JSON of every thought, tool call, and observation).
Define macro criteria (e.g., =E2=80=9Cmeeting booked=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Ctic=
ket solved with no reopen in 24 h=E2=80=9D).
Score micro steps for safety, cost, and policy compliance.
Fail the run if macro success < 90 % or any micro step violates policy / co=
st caps.
Minimal metric sketch (6 lines)
yaml

metrics: - name: macro_success # threshold: 0.90 - name: step_safety # thre=
shold: 0.95 - name: total_cost_usd # max_usd: 0.05
What a non-technical leader can do
Define =E2=80=9Cdone.=E2=80=9D Write a plain-language goal the agent must h=
it (e.g., =E2=80=9Cflight booked in correct currency=E2=80=9D).
List forbidden moves. APIs or actions that always need human sign-off.
Set a cost ceiling per task and a maximum retry count.
Require a weekly trace review. Spot-check three successes and three failure=
s; demand fix plans.
Monday-morning quick wins for builders
Log every tool call and model thought to JSON; store in S3 or Postgres.
Write a Python scorer that marks macro_success and tallies cost.
Add a safety rubric to grade each step for policy breaches.
Gate deployment on 90 % success and zero red-flag steps.
Takeaway: Agents amplify both productivity and risk. Evaluating the entire =
trace=E2=80=94goal, steps, and spend=E2=80=94turns =E2=80=9Cblack-box magic=
=E2=80=9D into a controlled, measurable workflow.
Packing List =E2=80=94 the gear that works in every neighbourhood
Even though each stop has its own quirks, four items travel well no matter =
where you=E2=80=99re headed:
Pro tip: Store every eval run in a lightweight DB (SQLite or Postgres). Tre=
nd lines are more valuable than snapshots when you=E2=80=99re hunting regre=
ssions.

Evals are about risk management
Ship-ready evals are less about fancy metrics and more about turning invisi=
ble risks into visible gates. Once you have even a single YAML file blockin=
g a bad deploy, you=E2=80=99ve crossed the rubicon: the organisation now tr=
eats model quality just like uptime or test coverage.
Start tiny, iterate weekly. A four-line regex gate today beats a 20-page be=
nchmark report next quarter.
Let thresholds breathe. Review them every sprint; tighten when you can, loo=
sen when the business shifts.
Add one new eval per roadmap feature. New modality? New eval. New prompt ch=
ain? New eval. It becomes muscle memory.
Ways you sleep better:
You actually know the answer to the board=E2=80=99s question about LLM risk
You have the confidence to know you can measure what you ship ahead
You can better quantify actual launch risk (is 3% error acceptable here?)
If this all seemed like a lot, start with something simple=E2=80=94what qua=
drant are you in? Where are you building right now, and how does that plus =
your own organizational context shape your risk profile? Drop a note in the=
 comments and let me know.
