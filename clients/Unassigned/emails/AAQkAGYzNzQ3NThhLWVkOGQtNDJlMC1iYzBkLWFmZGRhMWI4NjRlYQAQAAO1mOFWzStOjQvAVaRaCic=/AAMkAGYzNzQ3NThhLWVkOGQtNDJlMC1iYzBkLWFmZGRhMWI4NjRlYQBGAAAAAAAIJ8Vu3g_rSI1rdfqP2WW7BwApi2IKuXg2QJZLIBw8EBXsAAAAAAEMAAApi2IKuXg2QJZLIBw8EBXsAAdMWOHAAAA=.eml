DAILY MEMO: IRAN'S MISSING URANIUM, ABRAHAM ACCORDS ENLARGEMENT [3]
THE U.N.'S NUCLEAR WATCHDOG "LOST VISIBILITY" ON HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
MISSING URANIUM. The International Atomic Energy Agency has lost track [4] of 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of Iranian uranium enriched to 60 percent, according to Director General Rafael Grossi. He said
Tehran must show inspectors where the uranium is. He also criticized the Iranian parliament’s decision to suspend cooperation with the agency, stressing that Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
obligations are binding.
STAY TUNED. Key announcements are expected soon regarding the expansion of the Abraham Accords [5], U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said. According to Witkoff, several states have signaled readiness
to pursue normalization with Israel, describing the post-ceasefire environment following the Iran-Israel escalation as an opportunity for broader regional peace. Witkoff expressed cautious optimism
that Iran may be willing to negotiate on its nuclear program, which he said remains a red line for Washington.
INVESTMENT SLUMP. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. foreign direct investment inflows fell [6] to $52.8 billion, a 21 percent drop from the same period in 2024 and the lowest level since the fourth
quarter of 2022, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Despite the decline in actual capital inflows, greenfield FDI commitments hit a record $183 billion. The disparity suggests that while
firms are announcing investments aligned with President Donald Trump’s "America First" agenda, execution remains limited. Further uncertainty looms with the July 8 expiration of the 90-day
“Liberation Day” tariff pause, which could further depress annual FDI.
ON ONE CONDITION. Iran has agreed to the creation of a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction [7] – on the condition that Israel is included. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian
conveyed this position during a phone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. The two leaders also discussed the importance of cooperation among regional and extra-regional powers to
stabilize the Middle East.
THREAT ASSESSMENTS. Israel must accelerate its rearmament [8] to counter Iran, whose ambitions remain unchanged, according to Amir Baram, the director general of Israel’s Defense Ministry. Speaking
during a visit to defense contractor Rafael, Baram called for the urgent expansion of production capacity and the development of next-generation combat systems, urging full mobilization of state
institutions. Meanwhile, Mossad chief David Barnea said the Iranian threat had been “significantly neutralized” [9] but added that Israel would continue to monitor developments in the Islamic
Republic.
DIRECT TALKS. Israel and Syria are engaged in direct dialogue [10] on security and political coordination, according to Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi. Speaking at a closed meeting
of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, Hanegbi identified Syria and Lebanon as candidates to join the Abraham Accords and added that Israel could consider withdrawing from the buffer
zone in Syria if relations normalize. Meanwhile, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa said Damascus is talking to Israel [11] through international mediators about ending Israeli strikes on "peaceful
areas" in Quneitra province. At a meeting with Druze elders from Quneitra and the Golan Heights, al-Sharaa said the discussions also addressed worsening humanitarian and security conditions amid
recent Israeli incursions. Syrian media noted this was his first public acknowledgment of the talks.
REINFORCEMENTS. North Korea is expected to deploy more troops to Russia [12] within two months to support the invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean intelligence. In addition to new infantry
units, 25,000 North Koreans may be sent to produce Shahed-type drones. Pyongyang will also reportedly send 1,000 combat engineers and 5,000 military construction personnel to help rebuild Russia’s
Kursk region.
SCO RIFT. Defense ministers of Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states convened [13] in Qingdao, China, one day after the NATO summit in The Hague. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh
declined to sign the joint communique [14], objecting to its omission of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir, while citing militant activity in
the Pakistani province of Balochistan. Singh said the statement threatened to undermine India’s counterterrorism stance. On the sidelines, Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun met separately with
Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov [15] and Iran’s defense chief aboard an advanced Chinese warship. Dong reportedly condemned hegemonic behavior [16].
CHINESE STEEL. China has sharply increased exports [17] of iron, steel and related products to Russia. In the first five months of 2025, exports rose 16 percent year-over-year to $1.63 billion. May
alone saw a 22 percent surge, reaching $355.4 million. The uptick comes amid weak domestic demand in China and is concentrated in Russia’s Far East and Siberia.
GREEN ENERGY. China Datang Overseas Investment Co. and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum to advance a "green energy corridor," [18] focusing on offshore wind and solar energy development [19]. Baku has
expressed interest in expanding cooperation with China, including joint research, tech transfer and workforce development.
TRANSPORT CORRIDORS. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov in Ashgabat to discuss logistics and transport corridors [20]. The meeting coincided with a
session of the Russian-Turkmen Intergovernmental Commission in which the International North–South Transport Corridor is expected to be discussed.
