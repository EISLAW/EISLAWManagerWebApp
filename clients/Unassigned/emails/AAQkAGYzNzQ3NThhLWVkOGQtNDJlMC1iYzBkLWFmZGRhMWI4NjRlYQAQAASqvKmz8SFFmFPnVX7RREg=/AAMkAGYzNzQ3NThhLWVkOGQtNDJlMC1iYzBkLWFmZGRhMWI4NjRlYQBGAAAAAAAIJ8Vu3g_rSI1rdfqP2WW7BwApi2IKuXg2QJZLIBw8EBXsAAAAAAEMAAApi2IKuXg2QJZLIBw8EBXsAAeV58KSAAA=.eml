A REALIST VIEW OF EUROPE’S ‘DRONE WALL’ [3]
POLITICAL EXPECTATIONS MAY DIFFER FROM THE OPERATIONAL REALITY.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
European capitals and NATO partners are getting serious about a “drone wall” for Europe’s eastern flank. Public pressure and a series of recent incursions by small unmanned aircraft systems
(UAS) in multiple European states have pushed air defense onto national agendas. While drones can be used as weapons themselves (and often are in war zones), European governments today are focused on
other UAS-related threats. Indeed, drones can serve as persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, and can carry jammers, spoofers or electronic decoys that interfere with
air defense systems. Europe’s political commitment to a barrier against this threat is real, but the operational foundations beneath the rhetoric remain uncertain simply because there is no common
understanding of what a wall would entail.
Cheap, long-range drones have become a cost-effective way of needling an adversary. A $30,000 one-way drone can force a defending nation to spend 10 times more on interception. Unless this gap
narrows, perimeter deployments could become financially unsustainable over time. Low-altitude flight and near-border launch zones reduce reaction time, demanding dense sensor networks that expand
costs and require continuous energy input and coordination few states can sustain alone.
Electronic warfare is a powerful but limited counter. Its reach depends on power, geometry and logistics: Small jammers cover only a few kilometers, while even large fixed emitters rarely exceed
70-100 kilometers (about 40-60 miles) under ideal conditions. That limited reach matters because much of Europe’s industrial and energy base lies close to its eastern borders. The absence of deep
geographic buffers – and the presence of open air corridors such as the narrow Baltic passage near Kaliningrad – makes detection and response complex. Europe’s geography thus underscores that
mobility, coordination and energy resilience should be central to its counter-drone strategy.
LOGISTICS
Defending against long-range and loitering drones is first a problem of physics and logistics, not just technology. Effective jamming is ultimately a power contest: the jammer must overwhelm the
drone’s control signal by transmitting a stronger interfering signal – known as achieving a favorable jammer-to-signal ratio – requiring antenna alignment, cooling and constant energy.
Maintaining that margin requires continuous power supply and operational flexibility to sustain detection and response across European airspace. A comprehensive defense also depends on shared command
structures and compatible procedures between states to manage the wider network and prevent gaps in coverage.
Small, mobile jammers can cover one segment of airspace at a time, while stronger fixed emitters can reach limited distances within a fixed line of sight. Even airborne and maritime radars, while
extending coverage, have physical limitations: Surface clutter, radar horizon limits and small radar cross-sections reduce their detection range. Maintaining coverage across an entire frontier would
also present challenges in terms of power supply and sustainment. A 50-kilowatt jammer requires 300-800 liters of diesel per day under continuous load, so every section of the drone wall would require
daily refueling and other logistics. Mobile electronic warfare teams, pre-positioned hybrid power kits and modular generators could help consolidate these costs in high-risk areas without requiring
permanent, fuel-hungry installations.
CASE STUDIES
Ukrainian drones have in recent months been targeting oil refineries deep within Russian territory. But these attacks have been unable to cripple Russia’s energy infrastructure [4], in part because
its key refineries are located hundreds of kilometers from its borders, meaning electronic warfare, short-range air defense and surface-to-air missile systems together create multiple lines of
defense. Europe, on the other hand, doesn’t have the benefit of distance. Much of its industry lies within proximity to Russian-controlled territory, Russian neighbors or Russia proper, condensing
warning times and demanding wide and costly coverage for defense.
Yet even Russia’s layered model – with depth, practice and dense electronic warfare grids – has limitations. Persistent proximate launches, swarm attacks and terrain-hugging flight paths have
repeatedly found openings. Russia’s strategic depth can delay impact, but it is not a guaranteed safeguard.
Ukraine, lacking geographic depth of its own, relies on mobility, dispersion and improvisation. Small electronic warfare teams, mobile radar relays and locally produced interceptors enable rapid
repositioning and partial denial around critical sites. This flexibility blunts many attacks but also reveals the cost of endurance.
Israel, meanwhile, compensates for its own lack of depth in a very different way, with tight integration, centralized command, constant coordination and years of operational experience. Its compact
size (its international borders measure roughly 700 kilometers) and centralized command enable tight sensor-to-shooter loops and a high operational tempo, helping defend even against massed attacks.
Systems such as the Drone Dome, the Iron Dome and the Iron Beam combine soft-kill jamming with kinetic and directed-energy interceptors, showing that layering can work when centralized. Like Russia,
Israel possesses advantages Europe lacks, meaning the Continent will find it difficult to emulate Israeli results.
Even in Israel, however, swarm attacks and simultaneous pressure on multiple fronts can breach defenses, underscoring that integration and tempo reduce vulnerability but cannot eliminate it. In all
these cases, therefore, the common lesson is that coverage does not guarantee security. Layered sensors and effectors need to be sustained with energy, mobility and disciplined munitions management.
It would be unrealistic, then, to think of Europe’s drone wall as an impenetrable barrier.
IMPERATIVES AND CONSTRAINTS
The project’s core imperative is to deny drones access to critical nodes and corridors through detection, disruption and, when necessary, interception. Defense of rail, port, telecommunications and
energy infrastructure would be key. Multiple tools must be used to achieve these ends. Electronic warfare, interceptor drones, gun systems and directed energy weapons offer sustainable and
cost-effective options. Proximate launch corridors must be disrupted through persistent surveillance, policing and law enforcement coordination. A fusion of civil and military efforts is also
necessary to coordinate radar, telecoms and ISR capabilities. Regular anti-drone exercises and streamlined legal protocols ensure quick decision-making and enforcement without interfering with
civilian systems or violating the sovereignty of neighboring nations.
In terms of constraints, Europe is facing many. Chief among them are a severe attacker-defender cost asymmetry and a large coverage area. Reloading modern mobile surface-to-air missile launchers
typically requires a transloader (or crane) and 30-60 minutes per launch. Reconstituting a full battery takes even longer and exposes resupply crews to risk. High-end systems like the Patriot are
optimized for high-altitude aircraft and ballistic missile threats and are ill-suited for small, low-signature drones. Geography, meanwhile, is an ever-present constraint. NATO’s eastern flank
stretches nearly 3,800 kilometers along the borders of Russia and Belarus, demanding continuous coverage across multiple national boundaries.
Drone detection is also challenging, requiring different sensors than long-range air surveillance would offer. Counter-drone systems typically use specialized high-resolution radars supported by
radio-frequency, electro-optical and acoustic sensors that help locate and track small, low-flying drones. These sensors trade range for the finer resolution needed to detect and follow low-altitude
targets. Over time, these measures erode the attacker’s cost advantage, as raids become more expensive and therefore intermittent and politically ineffective.
Legal and diplomatic constraints also apply. Bureaucracy and complex decision-making structures can delay procurement and hiring of qualified personnel, slowing expansion and complicating
implementation. Political pressure for tangible results encourages quick outcomes, risking secondary effects that could have unintended consequences and ramifications for civilian networks. Human
error, resulting from operator fatigue or information overload, is another potential risk. Drone swarms and decoys can flood an airspace with false targets, making automation and disciplined
engagement essential. Trained and competent staff is essential for each node in the system to operate, refuel and rotate equipment. Ultimately, no system is airtight. Resilience – rapid repair and
functional redundancy – is key to success.
LOOKING AHEAD
In the near term, Europe may respond unevenly. Governments will secure corridors to potential targets – energy networks, ports and rail junctions – by deploying mobile electronic warfare units,
containerized power kits and layered soft-kill systems. These efforts will blunt most small-scale intrusions but will not eliminate them. Adversaries will adapt with proximate launches, decoys and
saturation tactics that test reload cycles. Militaries will quickly discover that jamming and denial are continuous power and logistics operations, not one-off undertakings.
Over the next several years, two trajectories are possible. In the first, Europe will treat UAS defense as a political-industrial project, enhancing energy and mobility capacity, upgrading low-cost
effectors, harmonizing civil-military data and conducting continuous tests of key corridors to measure recovery time and interception success. The European Defense Fund and NATO’s counter-UAS task
force offer models for turning fragmented national efforts into a coordinated defense posture.
Modern detection equipment will be central to this effort. Beyond incremental upgrades, Europe will need to design, test and field systems specifically built for sustained counter-UAS operations –
networked sensors, mobile power kits and interoperable command links that can function under hostile conditions.
The alternative path sees governments chasing the idea of an uninterrupted, impenetrable “wall.” Budgets will balloon as high-end interceptors and rushed prototypes fill the gap between political
expectations and operational reality. The result will be fiscal exhaustion without credible deterrence.
The direction Europe takes will involve political considerations. It cannot buy impermeability, but it can boost its response readiness and promote continuity by investing in energy security, mobile
denial capacity and institutional integration that keep defenses adaptable under strain.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">European capitals and NATO partners are getting serious about a “drone wall” for Europe’s eastern flank. Public pressure and a series of recent incursions by small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in multiple European states have pushed air defense onto national agendas. While drones can be used as weapons themselves (and often are in war zones), European governments today are focused on other UAS-related threats. Indeed, drones can serve as persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, and can carry jammers, spoofers or electronic decoys that interfere with air defense systems. Europe’s political commitment to a barrier against this threat is real, but the operational foundations beneath the rhetoric remain uncertain simply because there is no common understanding of what a wall would entail.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cheap, long-range drones have become a cost-effective way of needling an adversary. A $30,000 one-way drone can force a defending nation to spend 10 times more on interception. Unless this gap narrows, perimeter deployments could become financially unsustainable over time. Low-altitude flight and near-border launch zones reduce reaction time, demanding dense sensor networks that expand costs and require continuous energy input and coordination few states can sustain alone.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Electronic warfare is a powerful but limited counter. Its reach depends on power, geometry and logistics: Small jammers cover only a few kilometers, while even large fixed emitters rarely exceed 70-100 kilometers (about 40-60 miles) under ideal conditions. That limited reach matters because much of Europe’s industrial and energy base lies close to its eastern borders. The absence of deep geographic buffers – and the presence of open air corridors such as the narrow Baltic passage near Kaliningrad – makes detection and response complex. Europe’s geography thus underscores that mobility, coordination and energy resilience should be central to its counter-drone strategy.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Logistics</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Defending against long-range and loitering drones is first a problem of physics and logistics, not just technology. Effective jamming is ultimately a power contest: the jammer must overwhelm the drone’s control signal by transmitting a stronger interfering signal – known as achieving a favorable jammer-to-signal ratio – requiring antenna alignment, cooling and constant energy. Maintaining that margin requires continuous power supply and operational flexibility to sustain detection and response across European airspace. A comprehensive defense also depends on shared command structures and compatible procedures between states to manage the wider network and prevent gaps in coverage.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Small, mobile jammers can cover one segment of airspace at a time, while stronger fixed emitters can reach limited distances within a fixed line of sight. Even airborne and maritime radars, while extending coverage, have physical limitations: Surface clutter, radar horizon limits and small radar cross-sections reduce their detection range. Maintaining coverage across an entire frontier would also present challenges in terms of power supply and sustainment. A 50-kilowatt jammer requires 300-800 liters of diesel per day under continuous load, so every section of the drone wall would require daily refueling and other logistics. Mobile electronic warfare teams, pre-positioned hybrid power kits and modular generators could help consolidate these costs in high-risk areas without requiring permanent, fuel-hungry installations.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ukrainian drones have in recent months been targeting oil refineries deep within Russian territory. But these attacks have been <a href="https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/414784/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW9wb2xpdGljYWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9ydXNzaWFuLWVuZXJneS1pcy1maW5lLWZvci1ub3cv" style="color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">unable to cripple Russia’s energy infrastructure</a>, in part because its key refineries are located hundreds of kilometers from its borders, meaning electronic warfare, short-range air defense and surface-to-air missile systems together create multiple lines of defense. Europe, on the other hand, doesn’t have the benefit of distance. Much of its industry lies within proximity to Russian-controlled territory, Russian neighbors or Russia proper, condensing warning times and demanding wide and costly coverage for defense.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Yet even Russia’s layered model – with depth, practice and dense electronic warfare grids – has limitations. Persistent proximate launches, swarm attacks and terrain-hugging flight paths have repeatedly found openings. Russia’s strategic depth can delay impact, but it is not a guaranteed safeguard.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ukraine, lacking geographic depth of its own, relies on mobility, dispersion and improvisation. Small electronic warfare teams, mobile radar relays and locally produced interceptors enable rapid repositioning and partial denial around critical sites. This flexibility blunts many attacks but also reveals the cost of endurance.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel, meanwhile, compensates for its own lack of depth in a very different way, with tight integration, centralized command, constant coordination and years of operational experience. Its compact size (its international borders measure roughly 700 kilometers) and centralized command enable tight sensor-to-shooter loops and a high operational tempo, helping defend even against massed attacks. Systems such as the Drone Dome, the Iron Dome and the Iron Beam combine soft-kill jamming with kinetic and directed-energy interceptors, showing that layering can work when centralized. Like Russia, Israel possesses advantages Europe lacks, meaning the Continent will find it difficult to emulate Israeli results.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Even in Israel, however, swarm attacks and simultaneous pressure on multiple fronts can breach defenses, underscoring that integration and tempo reduce vulnerability but cannot eliminate it. In all these cases, therefore, the common lesson is that coverage does not guarantee security. Layered sensors and effectors need to be sustained with energy, mobility and disciplined munitions management. It would be unrealistic, then, to think of Europe’s drone wall as an impenetrable barrier.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Imperatives and Constraints</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The project’s core imperative is to deny drones access to critical nodes and corridors through detection, disruption and, when necessary, interception. Defense of rail, port, telecommunications and energy infrastructure would be key. Multiple tools must be used to achieve these ends. Electronic warfare, interceptor drones, gun systems and directed energy weapons offer sustainable and cost-effective options. Proximate launch corridors must be disrupted through persistent surveillance, policing and law enforcement coordination. A fusion of civil and military efforts is also necessary to coordinate radar, telecoms and ISR capabilities. Regular anti-drone exercises and streamlined legal protocols ensure quick decision-making and enforcement without interfering with civilian systems or violating the sovereignty of neighboring nations.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In terms of constraints, Europe is facing many. Chief among them are a severe attacker-defender cost asymmetry and a large coverage area. Reloading modern mobile surface-to-air missile launchers typically requires a transloader (or crane) and 30-60 minutes per launch. Reconstituting a full battery takes even longer and exposes resupply crews to risk. High-end systems like the Patriot are optimized for high-altitude aircraft and ballistic missile threats and are ill-suited for small, low-signature drones. Geography, meanwhile, is an ever-present constraint. NATO’s eastern flank stretches nearly 3,800 kilometers along the borders of Russia and Belarus, demanding continuous coverage across multiple national boundaries.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Drone detection is also challenging, requiring different sensors than long-range air surveillance would offer. Counter-drone systems typically use specialized high-resolution radars supported by radio-frequency, electro-optical and acoustic sensors that help locate and track small, low-flying drones. These sensors trade range for the finer resolution needed to detect and follow low-altitude targets. Over time, these measures erode the attacker’s cost advantage, as raids become more expensive and therefore intermittent and politically ineffective.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Legal and diplomatic constraints also apply. Bureaucracy and complex decision-making structures can delay procurement and hiring of qualified personnel, slowing expansion and complicating implementation. Political pressure for tangible results encourages quick outcomes, risking secondary effects that could have unintended consequences and ramifications for civilian networks. Human error, resulting from operator fatigue or information overload, is another potential risk. Drone swarms and decoys can flood an airspace with false targets, making automation and disciplined engagement essential. Trained and competent staff is essential for each node in the system to operate, refuel and rotate equipment. Ultimately, no system is airtight. Resilience – rapid repair and functional redundancy – is key to success.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the near term, Europe may respond unevenly. Governments will secure corridors to potential targets – energy networks, ports and rail junctions – by deploying mobile electronic warfare units, containerized power kits and layered soft-kill systems. These efforts will blunt most small-scale intrusions but will not eliminate them. Adversaries will adapt with proximate launches, decoys and saturation tactics that test reload cycles. Militaries will quickly discover that jamming and denial are continuous power and logistics operations, not one-off undertakings.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Over the next several years, two trajectories are possible. In the first, Europe will treat UAS defense as a political-industrial project, enhancing energy and mobility capacity, upgrading low-cost effectors, harmonizing civil-military data and conducting continuous tests of key corridors to measure recovery time and interception success. The European Defense Fund and NATO’s counter-UAS task force offer models for turning fragmented national efforts into a coordinated defense posture.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Modern detection equipment will be central to this effort. Beyond incremental upgrades, Europe will need to design, test and field systems specifically built for sustained counter-UAS operations – networked sensors, mobile power kits and interoperable command links that can function under hostile conditions.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The alternative path sees governments chasing the idea of an uninterrupted, impenetrable “wall.” Budgets will balloon as high-end interceptors and rushed prototypes fill the gap between political expectations and operational reality. The result will be fiscal exhaustion without credible deterrence.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The direction Europe takes will involve political considerations. It cannot buy impermeability, but it can boost its response readiness and promote continuity by investing in energy security, mobile denial capacity and institutional integration that keep defenses adaptable under strain.</p>
