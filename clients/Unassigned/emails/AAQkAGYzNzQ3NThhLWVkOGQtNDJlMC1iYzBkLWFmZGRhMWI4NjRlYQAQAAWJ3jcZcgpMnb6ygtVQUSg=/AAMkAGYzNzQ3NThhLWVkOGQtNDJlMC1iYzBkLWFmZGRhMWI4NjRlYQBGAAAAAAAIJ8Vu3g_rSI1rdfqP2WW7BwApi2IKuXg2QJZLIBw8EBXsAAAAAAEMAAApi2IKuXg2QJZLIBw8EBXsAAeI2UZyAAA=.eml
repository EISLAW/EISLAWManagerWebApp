-dollar-workflows-in-10-minutes

In six months, AI agents have gone from speculative tech to must-haves.
And Notion AI just gave everyone the key to managing their own team of cust=
om agents for $20 a month.
And honestly, you can spin up the prompts to run this team in just a few mi=
nutes. Notion isn=E2=80=99t really admitting this, but the key to the magic=
 is their ability to combine smart AI agents with lots of tools to operate =
against your data. =20
Work is evolving so fast it sometimes makes me breathless. I just got done =
writing about how we=E2=80=99re evolving work into AI artifacts a few weeks=
 ago [ https://substack.com/redirect/72814927-f960-4fc1-b751-667d52ed24a9?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=
=94artifacts are interactive tools that you can create using a prompt in Cl=
aude or ChatGPT.=20
Well, now you can create ENTIRE WORKFLOWS and run them using AI agents in N=
otion AI. It=E2=80=99s not just one artifact. It=E2=80=99s a whole assembly=
 line. That=E2=80=99s how fast things are moving.
These aren=E2=80=99t simple automations. I=E2=80=99m talking about million =
dollar pieces of value. Agents that understand context, make decisions, che=
ck their own work, and operate across your entire knowledge base for up to =
10-20 minutes at a time. They can turn meeting notes into PRDs, act as an i=
nterview coach and score your interview responses against custom scoring ru=
brics, evaluate prompt variants and track them for you, generate task backl=
ogs=E2=80=94whatever repetitive knowledge work is eating your time.
These prompts might seem complex, but I=E2=80=99m gonna show you how easy t=
hey are to create. You can use ChatGPT-5 to build prompts to do this with n=
atural language. No code. No API wrangling. Just clear, structured instruct=
ions about what you want done. These agents need precision, but ChatGPT-5 i=
s well-equipped to provide that precision and I=E2=80=99m here to give you =
all the principles and prompt examples along the way.
After hammering on this since launch, I=E2=80=99ve figured out the patterns=
 that work.=20
8 principles that turn wishful instructions into production systems
I built 3 complete agent templates you can steal
You=E2=80=99ll get links to the Notion pages themselves
Plus a video breakdown
Plus the prompts I used to create the pages
These are valuable workflows=E2=80=94they cost millions to run at most comp=
anies
I also built you a master prompt template you can use for other workflows
And I laid out where Notion does and doesn=E2=80=99t work well (it=E2=80=99=
s not perfect!)
The future of work isn=E2=80=99t about AI replacing us. It=E2=80=99s about =
every knowledge worker commanding their own team of specialized agents. Tha=
t future isn=E2=80=99t in five years. It=E2=80=99s available right now, for=
 about one Netflix per month.
Let me show you exactly how to build your first AI work engine, and why the=
 people who figure this out today will have massive leverage over everyone =
still copying and pasting from ChatGPT tomorrow.
Every knowledge worker is about to become an AI systems architect. They jus=
t don=E2=80=99t know it yet. The good news is it=E2=80=99s really easy with=
 a little bit of LLM help.
The gap between =E2=80=9CAI user=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CAI builder=E2=80=9D =
just collapsed to zero. For twenty dollars.
Documents are dead, but AI workflows are exploding to life. Hop aboard=E2=
=80=94it=E2=80=99s tons of fun!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Notion Just Built the Agentic Artifacts Factory Nobody=E2=80=99s Talking Ab=
out
Why custom AI agents are about to transform how every knowledge worker oper=
ates
The Opportunity Most People Are Missing
I spent the last few days hammering on Notion=E2=80=99s new AI agents, and =
I=E2=80=99m going to tell you something their marketing team won=E2=80=99t:=
 they accidentally built the most accessible custom AI agent platform on th=
e market.=20
They keep talking about it as if it=E2=80=99s for Notion users. It=E2=80=99=
s not. It=E2=80=99s for all of us. And almost nobody realizes it yet.
If you=E2=80=99re hunting for a job right now, this is your secret weapon f=
or standing out. I=E2=80=99ll show you how to build an interview coach that=
 scores your answers in real-time. If you=E2=80=99re an AI builder, this is=
 how you prototype agent workflows without writing code. And if you=E2=80=
=99re a PM, engineer, or marketer trying to keep up with AI transformation,=
 this is the bridge between where work is today and where it=E2=80=99s head=
ing tomorrow.
The shift I=E2=80=99m about to describe isn=E2=80=99t coming in five years.=
 It=E2=80=99s happening right now, and the people who understand it first w=
ill have a massive advantage.
Understanding Agentic Artifacts
Here=E2=80=99s what most people miss about AI: we=E2=80=99re moving from a =
world where we write documents to a world where we create living artifacts =
that AI can operate on.
Think about the difference between a static PRD sitting in Google Docs vers=
us a PRD that=E2=80=99s actually a database where AI can check completion s=
tatus, update risk assessments, and automatically generate tasks. The first=
 is a document. The second is what I call an agentic artifact - something d=
esigned from the ground up to be both human-readable and agent-operable.
This isn=E2=80=99t about making prettier documents. It=E2=80=99s about fund=
amentally rethinking how work gets structured. When I create a meeting note=
s database in Notion now, I=E2=80=99m not just organizing information. I=E2=
=80=99m creating a substrate that agents can traverse, update, and act upon=
 autonomously. The artifact becomes the interface between human intent and =
agent execution.
The traditional document is dead. What=E2=80=99s replacing it is something =
far more interesting: structured data that agents can manipulate while huma=
ns supervise. And this changes everything about how we think about knowledg=
e work.
What Notion 3.0 Actually Built
Notion didn=E2=80=99t call their release =E2=80=9Ccustom AI agents,=E2=80=
=9D but that=E2=80=99s exactly what they built. Their AI can now perform au=
tonomous work across multiple steps, running for up to 20 minutes (though i=
n my testing, 5-10 minutes was more typical).
What makes this powerful isn=E2=80=99t just the AI - it=E2=80=99s how Notio=
n married databases, page permissions, and AI together. The system now has =
granular database row permissions, meaning AI can update specific rows with=
out touching everything else. It=E2=80=99s using MCP (Model Context Protoco=
l) connectors to pull in data from Gmail, Google Drive, Linear, and GitHub.
But here=E2=80=99s what really matters: you control all of this through nat=
ural language instructions, not code. You=E2=80=99re essentially programmin=
g agent behavior through detailed prompts. The barrier to entry just droppe=
d from =E2=80=9Cknows Python=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Ccan write clear instructi=
ons.=E2=80=9D
They=E2=80=99re positioning this as a way to save money by consolidating AI=
 tools, which is smart marketing. But what they=E2=80=99ve actually built i=
s a platform where any knowledge worker can create custom agents that opera=
te on their data. That=E2=80=99s a much bigger deal than they=E2=80=99re le=
tting on.
Strengths and Weaknesses
Let me be clear about what works and what doesn=E2=80=99t, because Notion=
=E2=80=99s marketing won=E2=80=99t tell you the painful parts.
What Works: The agent=E2=80=99s ability to create and modify complex databa=
se structures is genuinely impressive. I built an interview coaching system=
 with scoring rubrics in minutes. The meeting-to-PRD pipeline I created wou=
ld have taken days of manual work - it took about two minutes to generate o=
nce I had the right prompt. The integration with external tools through MCP=
 means you can pull in real data, not just shuffle existing information aro=
und.
What=E2=80=99s Painful: This system is incredibly prompt-dependent. Casual =
instructions like =E2=80=9Cmake a database for this=E2=80=9D rarely work we=
ll. You need structured, specific prompting that tells the agent exactly wh=
ere to work, what done looks like, and how to handle edge cases. The learni=
ng curve isn=E2=80=99t in the technology - it=E2=80=99s in learning to thin=
k like an agent orchestrator.
Performance can be inconsistent. While Notion claims 20-minute execution ti=
mes, I found 5-10 minutes was easy to get, and incomplete results were rela=
tively common on first run unless I got obsessive about prompting. The agen=
t also tends toward token efficiency, doing less than expected unless you e=
xplicitly define quality checks and completion criteria.
Most frustrating: error messages are often opaque. When something fails, yo=
u=E2=80=99re left guessing whether it=E2=80=99s a permissions issue, a prom=
pt problem, or a system limitation. This makes debugging your agent workflo=
ws an exercise in patient experimentation.
Eight Principles for Agent Prompting
After digging in a fair bit since Notion AI was released, I=E2=80=99ve real=
ized that there=E2=80=99s no escaping some core principles of good agentic =
prompting. This model does not like wishy washy prompts. Through practice, =
I identified eight principles that separate functional agent prompts from w=
ishful thinking. These aren=E2=80=99t Notion-specific - they=E2=80=99re rul=
es for the future of working with AI agents on any platform.
1. Lock down the scope like you=E2=80=99re containing a hazard
The first thing you learn the hard way is that agents will interpret =E2=80=
=9Cwork on my stuff=E2=80=9D as broadly as possible. I once asked an agent =
to =E2=80=9Corganize my meeting notes=E2=80=9D and watched it start editing=
 pages from three months ago. Now I always specify: =E2=80=9COperate only o=
n this page and its direct subpages, touching only items created or modifie=
d in the last 24 hours.=E2=80=9D
The temporal boundary is crucial. Without it, agents will helpfully =E2=80=
=9Cfix=E2=80=9D historical data, breaking references and confusing your ent=
ire team. Think of scope definition as drawing a fence around a constructio=
n site - you want the work happening inside the fence, not randomly across =
the neighborhood.
I=E2=80=99ve found the sweet spot is usually 24-48 hours for most workflows=
, though some batch operations might need a week. The key is being explicit=
 about both spatial boundaries (which pages) and temporal ones (how recent)=
=2E
2. Define =E2=80=9Cdone=E2=80=9D with receipt confirmation
Agents need closure, and so do you. The biggest source of frustration I enc=
ountered was not knowing whether an agent had finished, failed, or was stil=
l thinking. Now every prompt I write includes this instruction: =E2=80=9CWh=
en finished, append exactly one line at the bottom: OK - [what you accompli=
shed]. If blocked, append: BLOCKED - [specific reason].=E2=80=9D
This simple pattern transforms vague AI behavior into clear communication. =
You glance at the page and immediately know the status. No more wondering i=
f the agent is still processing or if it silently failed ten minutes ago.
The receipt also becomes valuable documentation. When you run the same agen=
t weekly, those receipts create a natural log of what changed over time. I=
=E2=80=99ve caught data quality issues just by noticing the receipt said =
=E2=80=9C3 items processed=E2=80=9D when it usually says =E2=80=9C8 items p=
rocessed.=E2=80=9D
3. Structure everything as tables before text
This was my biggest mental shift. My instinct was to have agents write docu=
ments, but documents are terrible for validation and iteration. Tables, on =
the other hand, are structured, queryable, and easy to validate.
Now I design workflows where agents first populate database fields - title,=
 summary, metrics, status - and only after all validation passes do they re=
nder that data into readable text. This approach catches errors before they=
 become embedded in paragraphs of prose.
For example, when converting meeting notes to PRDs, the agent first creates=
 database rows with fields for =E2=80=9CProblem Statement,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=
=9CSuccess Metrics,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CNon-Goals.=E2=80=9D Each field ca=
n be individually validated. Only after checks pass does it create the form=
atted PRD document (optionally, if you ask it). This two-phase approach - s=
tructured data first, formatted output second - prevents the kind of halluc=
ination that=E2=80=99s hard to spot in flowing text.
4. Build quality gates that actually gate
Without explicit quality checks, agents optimize for completion, not qualit=
y. They=E2=80=99ll mark tasks done that are barely started. The solution is=
 building gates that must be passed before anything is marked complete.
Here=E2=80=99s what actually works: specific, measurable criteria. Instead =
of =E2=80=9Cwrite a good cover letter,=E2=80=9D I specify: =E2=80=9CLength =
must be 180-220 words. Must include the company name and role. Must contain=
 at least one quantified achievement from the resume. Must include one spec=
ific initiative you=E2=80=99d pursue in the first 90 days. Cannot use these=
 words: innovative, passionate, synergy, leverage, cutting-edge.=E2=80=9D
Yes this is work to think about, and ChatGPT-5 can help here by using best =
practice. But the detail is crucial to get it right.
The banned words list is particularly powerful. It forces the agent away fr=
om generic AI-speak and toward specific, concrete language. I maintain a ru=
nning list of overused AI phrases and add to it whenever I spot new pattern=
s.
The key insight: make the agent fail rather than guess. If it can=E2=80=99t=
 find a required element, it should mark the item as incomplete and tell yo=
u what=E2=80=99s missing, not make something up.
5. Prevent duplication with explicit rules
Agents have no memory between runs unless you build it in. Run the same pro=
mpt twice and you=E2=80=99ll get duplicate entries. This clutters your work=
space and makes it impossible to track what=E2=80=99s actually new.
The solution is simple but must be explicit: =E2=80=9CIf an item with the s=
ame title and type exists from the last 10 minutes, update it instead of cr=
eating a new one. Increment the version number only if you make material ch=
anges.=E2=80=9D
I learned to think about timing windows carefully. Too short (like 1 minute=
) and legitimate re-runs create duplicates. Too long (like 24 hours) and yo=
u can=E2=80=99t iterate quickly. Ten minutes is my default for most interac=
tive workflows.
The version numbering becomes crucial for audit trails. When something brea=
ks, you can see exactly which version introduced the problem. It=E2=80=99s =
also helpful for stakeholders who want to know if a document has been updat=
ed since they last reviewed it.
6. Create audit trails before you need them
The first time an agent corrupts important data, you=E2=80=99ll wish you ha=
d logs. Now I build them in from the start. Every agent maintains a simple =
Run Log table: timestamp, items processed, changes made, warnings, and link=
s to modified content.
This isn=E2=80=99t just for debugging. These logs become valuable analytics=
=2E I can see patterns like =E2=80=9CPRD=20=
generation takes longer on Mondays=
=E2=80=9D (more meeting notes to process) or =E2=80=9CCustomer feedback pro=
cessing peaks after our Thursday customer success calls.=E2=80=9D
The log should be lightweight - you=E2=80=99re not building a surveillance =
system. But having even basic tracking means you can answer questions like =
=E2=80=9CWhen did this change?=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CHow many items did we p=
rocess last month?=E2=80=9D without detective work.
7. Write in absolutes, not suggestions
Agents interpret vagueness as permission to improvise. =E2=80=9CAdd several=
 examples=E2=80=9D becomes anywhere from 2 to 15. =E2=80=9CMake it concise=
=E2=80=9D could mean 50 words or 500. This variability makes outputs unpred=
ictable and breaks downstream processes.
Instead, I write with newspaper-like precision: =E2=80=9CCreate exactly 6 q=
uestions: 2 behavioral, 3 technical, 1 culture fit. Each answer must be 75-=
100 words. Include one specific metric in each technical answer.=E2=80=9D
This extends to style instructions too. Rather than =E2=80=9Cwrite professi=
onally,=E2=80=9D I specify: =E2=80=9CUse active voice. Start sentences with=
 verbs where possible. One idea per sentence. No sentences over 20 words.=
=E2=80=9D The result is consistent, predictable output that doesn=E2=80=99t=
 require human editing.
8. Never allow invented facts
The most dangerous agent behavior is confident fabrication. An agent will h=
appily invent customer quotes, metric improvements, or technical specificat=
ions if not explicitly prevented.
My rule is REAL clear: =E2=80=9CIf information is not found in the source d=
ata, insert [TK-confirm] and mark the item as incomplete. Do not infer, est=
imate, or create placeholder data.=E2=80=9D The [TK-confirm] marker is an o=
ld editorial notation that stands out visually and is easy to search for.
This principle extends to calculations and analysis. If the agent is comput=
ing metrics, I require it to show the source numbers and calculation method=
=2E If it=E2=80=99s making a claim about p=
erformance, it must cite the specif=
ic data point. No exceptions.
The result is outputs I can trust. Yes, they sometimes have [TK-confirm] ma=
rkers that require human input. But that=E2=80=99s infinitely better than p=
lausible-sounding fiction that makes it into production.
Master Template Prompt Structure

n scan through here (and watch the video) to quickly see how I apply each o=

w minutes.

This agent solves a problem every AI team faces: prompt regression. You twe=
ak a prompt to fix one issue and break three others. This system treats pro=
mpts like code that needs testing. You define evaluation rules (must includ=
e metrics, must avoid certain phrases, must be under 200 words), and the ag=
ent runs your prompts through these tests, scoring them on a 0-100 scale. I=
t maintains variant tracking so you can see how v2-temperature-0.3 performs=
 compared to v1-baseline. Failed checks are explicitly logged with reasons,=
 not just pass/fail. Over time, you build a library of tested, scored promp=
ts with known performance characteristics rather than a folder of random te=
xt files.
ROLE
You are a Notion Agent that turns prompt experiments into evaluated, linked=
 records. Execute actions; do not print code. Operate ONLY inside this page=

with problem statements, success metrics, non-goals, risk matrices, and eva=
luation plans. But it doesn=E2=80=99t stop there - it generates a task back=
log with specific work items for engineering, design, data, and launch team=
s. Each PRD must pass acceptance checks: quantified success metrics with ti=
melines, explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep, and evaluation plans wi=
th red flags identified. Tasks are automatically categorized and linked bac=
k to their source PRD. What used to take a PM days of documentation work ha=
ppens in minutes, and the output is consistently structured.
ROLE
You are a Notion Agent that converts fresh meeting notes into a PRD and a l=
inked task backlog. Execute actions; keep changes scoped to this page (=E2=
=80=9DProduct Hub=E2=80=9D) and child pages.

SCOPE & SAFETY
- Only process Meetings updated in the last 24 hours with Status=3D=E2=80=
=9DNeeds PRD=E2=80=9D.
- Do not overwrite existing PRDs; create new with Versioning.
- If required databases are missing, create them inline.

DATA MODEL (create if missing)
1) Meetings (inline DB)
   - Title (title)
   - Notes (rich text)
   - Decision Owner (people)
   - Status (select: Notes, Needs PRD, PRD Created)
   - Date (date)

2) PRDs (inline DB)
   - Title (title)
   - Problem (rich text)
   - Users & Use Cases (rich text)
   - Success Metrics (rich text) -> 2-4 concrete, falsifiable metrics
   - Non-Goals (rich text)
   - Risks & Mitigations (rich text)
   - Eval Plan (rich text) -> eval data, acceptance tests, red flags
   - Version (number, default 1)
   - Source Meeting (relation -> Meetings)
   - Status (select: Draft, Ready for Review, Approved)

3) Tasks (inline DB)
   - Title (title)
   - Type (select: Design, Backend, Data, Eval, Launch)
   - PRD (relation -> PRDs)
   - Owner (people)
   - Due (date)
   - State (select: Todo, Doing, Done)

4) Run Log (inline DB)
   - Run At (date/time)
   - Meetings Processed (number)
   - PRDs Created (number)
   - Tasks Created (number)
   - Links (rich text)
   - Warnings (rich text)

TASKS (batch <=3D 3 meetings)
For each Meeting with Status=3D=E2=80=9DNeeds PRD=E2=80=9D in last 24h:
1) Draft a PRD:
   - Problem: 1-3 paragraphs; avoid solution language.
   - Users & Use Cases: bulleted; include 1 =E2=80=9Cedge=E2=80=9D case.
   - Success Metrics: =E2=89=A52 metrics with target & timing (e.g., =E2=80=
=9CReduce TAT from 48h=E2=86=9212h in 60 days=E2=80=9D).
   - Non-Goals: 3-5 bullets that explicitly say what we will NOT do.
   - Risks & Mitigations: at least 3 paired items.
   - Eval Plan: acceptance tests, offline vs online eval, red flags (brand/=
legal).
   - Link to Source Meeting; set Status=3D=E2=80=9DDraft=E2=80=9D.
2) Create seed Tasks (5-9) linked to the PRD:
   - Must include one Eval task (define test fixtures, golden sets, accepta=
nce rules).
   - Must include one Data task (instrumentation, logging for traces).
   - Must include one Launch task (guardrails, rollback plan).
3) Increment PRD Version if regenerating within 2 hours for same meeting.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (fail PRD if any fail)
- Success Metrics present with at least one numeric target + timeframe.
- Eval Plan contains both acceptance tests and red flags section.
- Non-Goals present with =E2=89=A53 bullets.
If any fail: set PRD.Status=3D=E2=80=9DDraft=E2=80=9D, append a callout =E2=
=80=9CPRD Checks Failed: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D listing missing items; DO NOT c=
reate tasks.

PUBLISH
Create/refresh a child page: =E2=80=9CPRD =E2=80=94 {Title} (v{Version})=E2=
=80=9D rendering all sections neatly, with a linked Tasks view filtered to =
this PRD. Set Meeting.Status=3D=E2=80=9DPRD Created=E2=80=9D.

LOGGING
Write a Run Log entry with counts and links to created PRDs and Tasks.

FINAL OUTPUT
Append exactly one line to the bottom of this page:=20
OK =E2=80=94 {N} PRDs drafted; {M} tasks seeded.
Making This Your Own
The real power here isn=E2=80=99t in copying my prompts - it=E2=80=99s in u=
nderstanding that we=E2=80=99re at an inflection point in how work gets don=
e.
Start by picking one workflow that frustrates you. Maybe it=E2=80=99s turni=
ng customer feedback into feature specs. Maybe it=E2=80=99s creating weekly=
 reports from scattered data. Maybe it=E2=80=99s maintaining a content cale=
ndar. Whatever it is, that=E2=80=99s your first agent.
Build it simple first. Get it working on a single page with a basic table. =
Then gradually add sophistication: quality checks, version control, connect=
ions to external data. The beauty of this approach is that you=E2=80=99re n=
ot committing to a complex system upfront. You=E2=80=99re evolving it as yo=
u learn what works.
Note: If you=E2=80=99re looking for a weakness, here it is. External data n=
eeds to be made available for Notion to work. So marketers looking for comp=
lex ad analytics could theoretically build something like a custom agent in=
 Notion=E2=80=94as long as the analytics got into Notion so the agent could=
 work. Notion knows this, and this is why they are actively building out th=
eir agent connectors via MCP.
Regardless, the bigger picture is this: every knowledge worker is about to =
become an agent orchestrator. The question isn=E2=80=99t whether this shift=
 happens - it=E2=80=99s whether you=E2=80=99re ahead of it or behind it. Th=
e people who figure out how to structure their work for agent operation wil=
l have massive leverage over those still treating documents as static artif=
acts.
This isn=E2=80=99t about Notion specifically. It=E2=80=99s about recognizin=
g that the interface between human creativity and AI execution is shifting =
from conversation to structured, operational artifacts. Notion just happens=
 to be the first platform that makes this accessible to non-programmers. Th=
ere will be others, but the principles remain the same.
The companies that figure this out will move at a different speed than thei=
r competitors. The individuals who master this will become indispensable. N=
ot because they=E2=80=99re better at using AI chat interfaces, but because =
they understand how to architect work itself for an agentic world.
Stop thinking about AI as a better search engine or writing assistant. Star=
t thinking about it as an operational layer that can traverse and transform=
 structured work artifacts. That=E2=80=99s the shift that=E2=80=99s actuall=
y happening, and now you have the tools to be part of it.

=E2=80=99s exactly what they built. Their AI can now perform autonomous wor=

isn=E2=80=99t just the AI - it=E2=80=99s how Notion married databases, page=
 permissions, and AI together. The system now has granular database row per=

 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What Works:</strong><span> The agent=E2=80=
=99s ability to create and modify complex database structures is genuinely =
impressive. I built an interview coaching system with scoring rubrics in mi=
nutes. The meeting-to-PRD pipeline I created would have taken days of manua=

 The integration with external tools through MCP means you can pull in real=

><strong>What=E2=80=99s Painful:</strong><span> This system is incredibly p=
rompt-dependent. Casual instructions like =E2=80=9Cmake a database for this=
=E2=80=9D rarely work well. You need structured, specific prompting that te=
lls the agent exactly where to work, what done looks like, and how to handl=

"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">Performance can be inconsistent. While Notion claims 20-minute execution =
times, I found 5-10 minutes was easy to get, and incomplete results were re=
latively common on first run unless I got obsessive about prompting. The ag=
ent also tends toward token efficiency, doing less than expected unless you=
 explicitly define quality checks and completion criteria.</p><p style=3D"m=

otion AI was released, I=E2=80=99ve realized that there=E2=80=99s no escapi=
ng some core principles of good agentic prompting. This model does not like=
 wishy washy prompts. Through practice, I identified eight principles that =
separate functional agent prompts from wishful thinking. These aren=E2=80=
=99t Notion-specific - they=E2=80=99re rules for the future of working with=
 AI agents on any platform.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The first =
thing you learn the hard way is that agents will interpret =E2=80=9Cwork on=
 my stuff=E2=80=9D as broadly as possible. I once asked an agent to =E2=80=
=9Corganize my meeting notes=E2=80=9D and watched it start editing pages fr=
om three months ago. Now I always specify: =E2=80=9COperate only on this pa=
ge and its direct subpages, touching only items created or modified in the =
last 24 hours.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The temporal boundary is crucial. W=
ithout it, agents will helpfully =E2=80=9Cfix=E2=80=9D historical data, bre=
aking references and confusing your entire team. Think of scope definition =
as drawing a fence around a construction site - you want the work happening=
 inside the fence, not randomly across the neighborhood.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=
=E2=80=99ve found the sweet spot is usually 24-48 hours for most workflows,=
 though some batch operations might need a week. The key is being explicit =
about both spatial boundaries (which pages) and temporal ones (how recent).=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;"><strong>2. Define =E2=80=9Cdone=E2=80=9D with receipt conf=
irmation</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Agents need closure, and so do you. The b=
iggest source of frustration I encountered was not knowing whether an agent=
 had finished, failed, or was still thinking. Now every prompt I write incl=
udes this instruction: =E2=80=9CWhen finished, append exactly one line at t=
he bottom: OK - [what you accomplished]. If blocked, append: BLOCKED - [spe=
cific reason].=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This simple pattern transforms vagu=
e AI behavior into clear communication. You glance at the page and immediat=
ely know the status. No more wondering if the agent is still processing or =
if it silently failed ten minutes ago.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The receipt also bec=
omes valuable documentation. When you run the same agent weekly, those rece=
ipts create a natural log of what changed over time. I=E2=80=99ve caught da=
ta quality issues just by noticing the receipt said =E2=80=9C3 items proces=
sed=E2=80=9D when it usually says =E2=80=9C8 items processed.=E2=80=9D</p><=

/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">This was my biggest mental shift. My instinct was to have a=
gents write documents, but documents are terrible for validation and iterat=
ion. Tables, on the other hand, are structured, queryable, and easy to vali=
date.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">Now I design workflows where agents first populate da=
tabase fields - title, summary, metrics, status - and only after all valida=
tion passes do they render that data into readable text. This approach catc=
hes errors before they become embedded in paragraphs of prose.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

eates database rows with fields for =E2=80=9CProblem Statement,=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9CSuccess Metrics,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CNon-Goals.=E2=80=9D Each fi=
eld can be individually validated. Only after checks pass does it create th=
e formatted PRD document (optionally, if you ask it). This two-phase approa=
ch - structured data first, formatted output second - prevents the kind of =
hallucination that=E2=80=99s hard to spot in flowing text.</p><p style=3D"m=

Without explicit quality checks, agents optimize for completion, not qualit=
y. They=E2=80=99ll mark tasks done that are barely started. The solution is=
 building gates that must be passed before anything is marked complete.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=

ria. Instead of =E2=80=9Cwrite a good cover letter,=E2=80=9D I specify: =E2=
=80=9CLength must be 180-220 words. Must include the company name and role.=
 Must contain at least one quantified achievement from the resume. Must inc=
lude one specific initiative you=E2=80=99d pursue in the first 90 days. Can=

6px;font-size: 16px;">The banned words list is particularly powerful. It fo=
rces the agent away from generic AI-speak and toward specific, concrete lan=
guage. I maintain a running list of overused AI phrases and add to it whene=
ver I spot new patterns.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The key insight: make the agent fa=
il rather than guess. If it can=E2=80=99t find a required element, it shoul=
d mark the item as incomplete and tell you what=E2=80=99s missing, not make=
 something up.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=

 explicit: =E2=80=9CIf an item with the same title and type exists from the=
 last 10 minutes, update it instead of creating a new one. Increment the ve=

16px;">The first time an agent corrupts important data, you=E2=80=99ll wish=
 you had logs. Now I build them in from the start. Every agent maintains a =
simple Run Log table: timestamp, items processed, changes made, warnings, a=
nd links to modified content.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn=E2=80=99t just for d=

basic tracking means you can answer questions like =E2=80=9CWhen did this c=

If information is not found in the source data, insert [TK-confirm] and mar=

;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This principle ex=
tends to calculations and analysis. If the agent is computing metrics, I re=
quire it to show the source numbers and calculation method. If it=E2=80=99s=
 making a claim about performance, it must cite the specific data point. No=
 exceptions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=

TASKS (batch &lt;=3D 10 experiments)
For each Experiments row with Status in {Proposed, Run} edited in last 2 ho=
urs:
1) Produce one Output using Prompt + Input (use low creativity, determinist=
ic tone).
2) Evaluate against Eval Rules:
   - For each rule, compute pass/fail.
   - Score =3D 100 * (sum of passed weights / sum of all weights).
   - Build Fails list describing any violations (cite rule names).
3) Write/Update a Results row (linked to this Experiment):
   - Output, Pass/Fail (Pass if Score=E2=89=A580), Fails, Score, Version (i=
ncrement if changed), Run At=3Dnow.
4) If at least one Result exists: set Experiment.Status=3D=E2=80=9DScored=
=E2=80=9D; else set =E2=80=9CRun=E2=80=9D.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (before saving a Result as final)
- Output must be =E2=89=A4 300 words.
- If Output makes a factual claim not in Input, replace with =E2=80=9C[TK-c=
onfirm]=E2=80=9D and mark Fail with reason =E2=80=9Cunverifiable=E2=80=9D.
- If regex rule exists for metric and none found, mark Fail.

PUBLISH
Create/refresh a child page: =E2=80=9CScorecard =E2=80=94 {today}=E2=80=9D
- Table with Experiments (Title, Variant Tag, Status) and their latest Resu=
lts (Score, Pass/Fail).
- A =E2=80=9CTop 3=E2=80=9D callout summarizing highest scores with links.

LOGGING

ting notes dying in notebooks. It ingests raw meeting notes and transforms =
them into structured PRDs with problem statements, success metrics, non-goa=
ls, risk matrices, and evaluation plans. But it doesn=E2=80=99t stop there =
- it generates a task backlog with specific work items for engineering, des=
ign, data, and launch teams. Each PRD must pass acceptance checks: quantifi=
ed success metrics with timelines, explicit non-goals to prevent scope cree=
p, and evaluation plans with red flags identified. Tasks are automatically =
categorized and linked back to their source PRD. What used to take a PM day=
s of documentation work happens in minutes, and the output is consistently =
structured.</p><pre style=3D"position: relative;background: #eeeeee;padding=

You are a Notion Agent that converts fresh meeting notes into a PRD and a l=
inked task backlog. Execute actions; keep changes scoped to this page (=E2=
=80=9DProduct Hub=E2=80=9D) and child pages.

SCOPE &amp; SAFETY
- Only process Meetings updated in the last 24 hours with Status=3D=E2=80=
=9DNeeds PRD=E2=80=9D.
- Do not overwrite existing PRDs; create new with Versioning.
- If required databases are missing, create them inline.

   - Run At (date/time)
   - Meetings Processed (number)
   - PRDs Created (number)
   - Tasks Created (number)
   - Links (rich text)
   - Warnings (rich text)

TASKS (batch &lt;=3D 3 meetings)
For each Meeting with Status=3D=E2=80=9DNeeds PRD=E2=80=9D in last 24h:
1) Draft a PRD:
   - Problem: 1-3 paragraphs; avoid solution language.
   - Users &amp; Use Cases: bulleted; include 1 =E2=80=9Cedge=E2=80=9D case=
.
   - Success Metrics: =E2=89=A52 metrics with target &amp; timing (e.g., =
=E2=80=9CReduce TAT from 48h=E2=86=9212h in 60 days=E2=80=9D).
   - Non-Goals: 3-5 bullets that explicitly say what we will NOT do.
   - Risks &amp; Mitigations: at least 3 paired items.
   - Eval Plan: acceptance tests, offline vs online eval, red flags (brand/=
legal).
   - Link to Source Meeting; set Status=3D=E2=80=9DDraft=E2=80=9D.
2) Create seed Tasks (5-9) linked to the PRD:
   - Must include one Eval task (define test fixtures, golden sets, accepta=
nce rules).
   - Must include one Data task (instrumentation, logging for traces).
   - Must include one Launch task (guardrails, rollback plan).
3) Increment PRD Version if regenerating within 2 hours for same meeting.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (fail PRD if any fail)
- Success Metrics present with at least one numeric target + timeframe.
- Eval Plan contains both acceptance tests and red flags section.
- Non-Goals present with =E2=89=A53 bullets.
If any fail: set PRD.Status=3D=E2=80=9DDraft=E2=80=9D, append a callout =E2=
=80=9CPRD Checks Failed: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D listing missing items; DO NOT c=
reate tasks.

PUBLISH
Create/refresh a child page: =E2=80=9CPRD =E2=80=94 {Title} (v{Version})=E2=
=80=9D rendering all sections neatly, with a linked Tasks view filtered to =
this PRD. Set Meeting.Status=3D=E2=80=9DPRD Created=E2=80=9D.

LOGGING
Write a Run Log entry with counts and links to created PRDs and Tasks.

FINAL OUTPUT
Append exactly one line to the bottom of this page:=20
OK =E2=80=94 {N} PRDs drafted; {M} tasks seeded.</code></code></pre><h2 cla=

re at an inflection point in how work gets done.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Start by p=
icking one workflow that frustrates you. Maybe it=E2=80=99s turning custome=
r feedback into feature specs. Maybe it=E2=80=99s creating weekly reports f=
rom scattered data. Maybe it=E2=80=99s maintaining a content calendar. What=
ever it is, that=E2=80=99s your first agent.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=

e first. Get it working on a single page with a basic table. Then gradually=
 add sophistication: quality checks, version control, connections to extern=
al data. The beauty of this approach is that you=E2=80=99re not committing =
to a complex system upfront. You=E2=80=99re evolving it as you learn what w=
orks.</p><blockquote style=3D"border-left: 4px solid #04d4f4;margin: 20px 0=

ft: 20px;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Note: If you=E2=80=99re lookin=
g for a weakness, here it is. External data needs to be made available for =
Notion to work. So marketers looking for complex ad analytics could theoret=
ically build something like a custom agent in Notion=E2=80=94as long as the=
 analytics got into Notion so the agent could work. Notion knows this, and =
this is why they are actively building out their agent connectors via MCP.<=

ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Regardless, the bigger picture is this: every =
knowledge worker is about to become an agent orchestrator. The question isn=
=E2=80=99t whether this shift happens - it=E2=80=99s whether you=E2=80=99re=
 ahead of it or behind it. The people who figure out how to structure their=
 work for agent operation will have massive leverage over those still treat=
ing documents as static artifacts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn=E2=80=99t about=
 Notion specifically. It=E2=80=99s about recognizing that the interface bet=
ween human creativity and AI execution is shifting from conversation to str=
uctured, operational artifacts. Notion just happens to be the first platfor=
m that makes this accessible to non-programmers. There will be others, but =
the principles remain the same.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The companies that figure t=
his out will move at a different speed than their competitors. The individu=
als who master this will become indispensable. Not because they=E2=80=99re =
better at using AI chat interfaces, but because they understand how to arch=
itect work itself for an agentic world.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Stop thinking about=
 AI as a better search engine or writing assistant. Start thinking about it=
 as an operational layer that can traverse and transform structured work ar=
tifacts. That=E2=80=99s the shift that=E2=80=99s actually happening, and no=
w you have the tools to be part of it.</p><blockquote style=3D"border-left:=
