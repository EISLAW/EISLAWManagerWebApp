 		 EDITOR=E2=80=99S NOTE: Sometimes the quietest days hide the biggest
trades. This story from Andrew is a perfect reminder of why
timing=E2=80=94and the right signal=E2=80=94matters. - Hannah

Yo Pit Crazies,

Tranquil summer days take me back to those crazy low days on the Cboe
floor=E2=80=94so slow that I=E2=80=99d sometimes nap at the bottom of my tr=
ading
pit. Yes, it really was that slow. But for a floor trader who didn=E2=80=99t
try to force things, those days also held great opportunity.=C2=A0

What I mean is chasing orders, filling trades at irrational prices,
and generally trying to force action=E2=80=94especially with a seat lease
and overhead to cover. That=E2=80=99s exactly how traders could get
themselves into trouble. Those were also the times when off-floor
firms would fish for distracted market makers. THAT=E2=80=99S WHERE OUR
SHORT SQUEEZE INDICATOR COMES IN
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/9c29bf82cc1d49308b20174f8e42a3de-407bce=
f48a694756bd22ac2398112381/57]=E2=80=94it's designed to help
identify those moments when it really _is_ time to pay attention. And
often, knowing when to focus is more than half the battle.

What began as a quiet summer day quickly turned into something very
different. I was trading a stock called C-CUBE in the mid-1990s,
during the early days of the Tech Boom. Customers loved selling puts
in that name=E2=80=94since they couldn=E2=80=99t get shares at the IPO, the=
re was
a constant stream of put orders flowing to market makers. With a small
number of shares issued, the stock had a limited float and very low
outstanding supply. To hedge, we bought stock=E2=80=94lots of it. I ended up
with a sizable position in both stock and puts, though at the time, it
was only making a little bit of money.

What happened next was the exact opposite of what I
expected=E2=80=94off-floor traders began quoting reversal conversions. These
are trades you typically see when a stock becomes hard to borrow. At
that point, I was long over 100,000 shares, and the interest costs
were climbing. I thought, =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s no way anyone would want=
 to
take me out of this position=E2=80=94it would be crazy.=E2=80=9D But they d=
id. An
off-floor trader offered to pay me to short the stock and sell
puts=E2=80=94effectively taking me out of my position with about a $50,000
profit. Not bad for what started as a slow summer day.

But my early experience spotting squeezes kicked in. I figured=E2=80=94no
one=E2=80=99s paying me $50K unless they expect to make at least $100K. So I
tested the waters with a small, aggressive bid on just a fraction of
my position=E2=80=94and the trader hit it. Suddenly, I was sitting on nearly
$100K in marked profits with 90% of my position still intact. Over the
next week, C-CUBE went wild as shorts were forced to cover, driving
the stock sharply higher. They came for my puts and stock, and by the
final sales, I was getting up to $4.00 more than my original price.
When it was all said and done, that quiet summer trade ended up
netting me $350,000.

All of that just from unwinding my positions.=C2=A0

When the Short Stock Indicator starts to move, that=E2=80=99s when I know
it=E2=80=99s time to pay attention.

ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 15pt; font-family: sans=

y different. I was trading a stock called C-CUBE in the mid-1990s, during t=
he early days of the Tech Boom. Customers loved selling puts in that name=
=E2=80=94since they couldn=E2=80=99t get shares at the IPO, there was a con=
stant stream of put orders flowing to market makers. With a small number of=
 shares issued, the stock had a limited float and very low outstanding supp=
ly. To hedge, we bought stock=E2=80=94lots of it. I ended up with a sizable=
 position in both stock and puts, though at the time, it was only making a =
little bit of money.</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 15pt; font-family: sans=
-serif;">What happened next was the exact opposite of what I expected=E2=80=
=94off-floor traders began quoting reversal conversions. These are trades y=
ou typically see when a stock becomes hard to borrow. At that point, I was =
long over 100,000 shares, and the interest costs were climbing. I thought, =
=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s no way anyone would want to take me out of this po=
sition=E2=80=94it would be crazy.=E2=80=9D But they did. An off-floor trade=
r offered to pay me to short the stock and sell puts=E2=80=94effectively ta=
king me out of my position with about a $50,000 profit. Not bad for what st=
arted as a slow summer day.</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 15pt; font-family: sans=

=80=94no one=E2=80=99s paying me $50K unless they expect to make at least $=
100K. So I tested the waters with a small, aggressive bid on just a fractio=
n of my position=E2=80=94and the trader hit it. Suddenly, I was sitting on =
nearly $100K in marked profits with 90% of my position still intact. Over t=
he next week, C-CUBE went wild as shorts were forced to cover, driving the =
stock sharply higher. They came for my puts and stock, and by the final sal=
es, I was getting up to $4.00 more than my original price. When it was all =
said and done, that quiet summer trade ended up netting me $350,000.</span>=
