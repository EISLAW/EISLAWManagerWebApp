GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: US INTERESTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
WHAT TO MAKE OF THE ALASKA SUMMIT [4]
Aug. 18, 2025
_Question: Why do you assert that the survival of Ukraine as an independent, sovereign state is not in the U.S. interest? If there is no danger to U.S. interests, why bother sending billions in funds
and weapons to Ukraine?_
Response: The fundamental concern of the United States is to prevent the rise of a nation that can threaten the United States directly. Its secondary concern is to prevent the rise of such nations
that might emerge in the future. Its third concern is to calibrate the risks and costs of actions in pursuit of these ends with the level of the threat. In shorter terms, don’t spend years in
Vietnam and 50,000 American lives based on the level of threat of a communist government in South Vietnam. So the level of effort and risk must be calibrated.
The issue here is the Russian threat to American interests in Europe. The United States limited the Russian threat to Europe for decades during the Cold War, with the boundary line in Germany. The
U.S. was prepared to wage war if Russia initiated it. This was a calibration of threat, effort and risk, and it worked. The border is now far to the east, and given what we now know of the Russian
military as opposed to what we thought of the Russian military in the Cold War, the threat to Europe is both more distant and much less threatening. Russia, having withdrawn from its former position,
has far reduced the threat it poses. If the border moves a few hundred miles west, the border and Russian capability would pose a rather minorly greater danger to American interests. The calibrated
answer would be to resist with limited risk to the U.S., without the use of U.S. forces. In this case, sending money and weapons to Ukraine to try to limit Russian actions is a prudent step. The cost
is far less than sending troops and engaging Russia directly, and to this point, it has been instrumental in limiting the Russian advance. For any nation, calibrating the interest, the risk and the
cost is essential.
There is, of course, the moral question of allowing blatant aggression. If we take a moral stance, then we could be involved in many wars around the world, as there are constant conflicts between and
within nations. But the primary moral responsibility of a nation’s government is to its people, the nation’s safety and the lives of its citizens. So the moral imperative to prevent Russia’s
success in invading Ukraine must be balanced carefully. So far, both the Biden and the Trump administrations have acted prudently by limiting American exposure to the war by providing aid and trying
to negotiate peace. The risk to the United States has guided the extent of involvement, and the imperative of serving American interests has been followed, as well as its moral responsibility.
-------------------------
_Question: Why do you believe Russia is not capable of coming back in the long term (in another few years) to take another bite from Ukraine even if it capitulates for now? Can you explain further why
you believe this?_
Response: The performance of Russia’s military in Ukraine has been far from competent. After more than three years, it has failed in its mission to take Ukraine. This was without any direct
intervention from foreign forces on the ground. I never thought the Russians were as powerful in conventional warfare during the Cold War as others did, and I have been shocked at how badly they have
fought in Ukraine and the massive losses they have incurred. Such a military failure cannot be solved in a few years.
War is about more than weapons. It means a massive shift in the military high command, generating a new doctrine of war, training less senior and junior officers in the new doctrine, and recruiting
and training a new force. The key is developing a new doctrine and a senior command built around it. It also requires designing weapons based on the doctrine. For that to happen, there has to be a
dynamic economy that can, as the United States did in World War II, produce the new weapons needed. For the United States in World War II, it required a massive change in both the national culture and
the American economy. I do not see that kind of dynamism in the Russian military, economy, or society. So while we must always be alert to the possibility of a shift and recalibrate based on that, I
do not see Russia as flexible and dynamic, nor as a nation so committed to this war that it will carry out a massive and rapid shift in its military capability.
-------------------------
_Question: Why does there need to be a ceasefire before discussions on a peace treaty can begin? It seems that many of the issues that will come up in a peace treaty will have to be decided on to
arrange a ceasefire. So why go through the same exercise twice?_
Response: I do not see a ceasefire as essential, but on both sides, there is a danger of their forces welcoming the ceasefire and then maintaining their morale if the war resumes. There is also the
danger that both sides will regroup, rearm and be more effective after a ceasefire. Both scenarios are possible. I think Russia fears that a ceasefire would strengthen Ukraine’s forces and weaken
its own, so it wants to maintain the war. I think Ukraine would benefit from a rest and getting increased weapons. It is defending its homeland; Russia is not. Ukrainian morale therefore would (I
believe) moderately benefit. It is clear that the Russians don’t want to risk this, although I do not believe they are now capable of taking Ukraine. So the Russians fear a ceasefire, while the
Ukrainians welcome it. Either way, peace can be negotiated while the war is ongoing (afterall, the U.S. and Vietnam negotiated peace while the war raged on), but in both cases, the Russians would have
to accept that they failed to defeat what they thought was going to be a slam-dunk, and Ukraine would have to accept that a part of Ukraine will be lost. Ceasefire or not, a negotiation can succeed.
The issue is far deeper than that.
-------------------------
_Question: Are we in the first stage of WWIII? The world is dividing into two basic camps – democratic systems of governance and dictatorial systems of governance. We already have the Ukraine war
and the Israel war. There is a significant chance that China will attempt to take advantage of a weakened Russia by annexing the eastern portion of Russia to secure its access to oil and gas supplies.
China is the greatest enemy of the democratic alliance._
Response: The First World War was not a world war but a European war in which the Americans intervened. The Second World War was much more of a global conflict because the European war evolved into a
massive fight in the Pacific. If, however, by a world war you mean simply a confrontation between great powers, I also find that unlikely. The limitation on a war between great powers is the existence
of nuclear weapons, and the principle that prevented a world war during the Cold War was mutual assured destruction. No nation is prepared for nuclear war with another nuclear power because of that
principle and reality. Wars between Russia, China and the United States have the real potential of being catastrophic for all. So we will see many strongly worded statements, and an entire generation
of diplomats making a good living.

<strong>What to Make of the Alaska Summit</strong></a><br>
Aug. 18, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Why =
do you assert that the survival of Ukraine as an independent, sovereign sta=
te is not in the U.S. interest? If there is no danger to U.S. interests, wh=
y bother sending billions in funds and weapons to Ukraine?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The fund=
amental concern of the United States is to prevent the rise of a nation tha=
t can threaten the United States directly. Its secondary concern is to prev=
ent the rise of such nations that might emerge in the future. Its third con=
cern is to calibrate the risks and costs of actions in pursuit of these end=
s with the level of the threat. In shorter terms, don=E2=80=99t spend years=
 in Vietnam and 50,000 American lives based on the level of threat of a com=
munist government in South Vietnam. So the level of effort and risk must be=
 calibrated.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The issue here is =
the Russian threat to American interests in Europe. The United States limit=
ed the Russian threat to Europe for decades during the Cold War, with the b=
oundary line in Germany. The U.S. was prepared to wage war if Russia initia=
ted it. This was a calibration of threat, effort and risk, and it worked. T=
he border is now far to the east, and given what we now know of the Russian=
 military as opposed to what we thought of the Russian military in the Cold=
 War, the threat to Europe is both more distant and much less threatening. =
Russia, having withdrawn from its former position, has far reduced the thre=
at it poses. If the border moves a few hundred miles west, the border and R=
ussian capability would pose a rather minorly greater danger to American in=
terests. The calibrated answer would be to resist with limited risk to the =
U.S., without the use of U.S. forces. In this case, sending money and weapo=
ns to Ukraine to try to limit Russian actions is a prudent step. The cost i=
s far less than sending troops and engaging Russia directly, and to this po=
int, it has been instrumental in limiting the Russian advance. For any nati=
on, calibrating the interest, the risk and the cost is essential.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There is, of cours=
e, the moral question of allowing blatant aggression. If we take a moral st=
ance, then we could be involved in many wars around the world, as there are=
 constant conflicts between and within nations. But the primary moral respo=
nsibility of a nation=E2=80=99s government is to its people, the nation=E2=
=80=99s safety and the lives of its citizens. So the moral imperative to pr=
event Russia=E2=80=99s success in invading Ukraine must be balanced careful=
ly. So far, both the Biden and the Trump administrations have acted prudent=
ly by limiting American exposure to the war by providing aid and trying to =
negotiate peace. The risk to the United States has guided the extent of inv=
olvement, and the imperative of serving American interests has been followe=
d, as well as its moral responsibility.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Why =
do you believe Russia is not capable of coming back in the long term (in an=
other few years) to take another bite from Ukraine even if it capitulates f=
or now? Can you explain further why you believe this?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The perf=
ormance of Russia=E2=80=99s military in Ukraine has been far from competent=
. After more than three years, it has failed in its mission to take Ukraine=
. This was without any direct intervention from foreign forces on the groun=
d. I never thought the Russians were as powerful in conventional warfare du=
ring the Cold War as others did, and I have been shocked at how badly they =
have fought in Ukraine and the massive losses they have incurred. Such a mi=
litary failure cannot be solved in a few years.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">War is about more =
than weapons. It means a massive shift in the military high command, genera=
ting a new doctrine of war, training less senior and junior officers in the=
 new doctrine, and recruiting and training a new force. The key is developi=
ng a new doctrine and a senior command built around it. It also requires de=
signing weapons based on the doctrine. For that to happen, there has to be =
a dynamic economy that can, as the United States did in World War II, produ=
ce the new weapons needed. For the United States in World War II, it requir=
ed a massive change in both the national culture and the American economy. =
I do not see that kind of dynamism in the Russian military, economy, or soc=
iety. So while we must always be alert to the possibility of a shift and re=
calibrate based on that, I do not see Russia as flexible and dynamic, nor a=
s a nation so committed to this war that it will carry out a massive and ra=
pid shift in its military capability.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Why =
does there need to be a ceasefire before discussions on a peace treaty can =
begin? It seems that many of the issues that will come up in a peace treaty=
 will have to be decided on to arrange a ceasefire. So why go through the s=
ame exercise twice?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I do not=
 see a ceasefire as essential, but on both sides, there is a danger of thei=
r forces welcoming the ceasefire and then maintaining their morale if the w=
ar resumes. There is also the danger that both sides will regroup, rearm an=
d be more effective after a ceasefire. Both scenarios are possible. I think=
 Russia fears that a ceasefire would strengthen Ukraine=E2=80=99s forces an=
d weaken its own, so it wants to maintain the war. I think Ukraine would be=
nefit from a rest and getting increased weapons. It is defending its homela=
nd; Russia is not. Ukrainian morale therefore would (I believe) moderately =
benefit. It is clear that the Russians don=E2=80=99t want to risk this, alt=
hough I do not believe they are now capable of taking Ukraine. So the Russi=
ans fear a ceasefire, while the Ukrainians welcome it. Either way, peace ca=
n be negotiated while the war is ongoing (afterall, the U.S. and Vietnam ne=
gotiated peace while the war raged on), but in both cases, the Russians wou=
ld have to accept that they failed to defeat what they thought was going to=
 be a slam-dunk, and Ukraine would have to accept that a part of Ukraine wi=
ll be lost. Ceasefire or not, a negotiation can succeed. The issue is far d=
eeper than that.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Are =
we in the first stage of WWIII? The world is dividing into two basic camps =
=E2=80=93 democratic systems of governance and dictatorial systems of gover=
nance. We already have the Ukraine war and the Israel war. There is a signi=
ficant chance that China will attempt to take advantage of a weakened Russi=
a by annexing the eastern portion of Russia to secure its access to oil and=
 gas supplies. China is the greatest enemy of the democratic alliance.</em>=
</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The Firs=
t World War was not a world war but a European war in which the Americans i=
ntervened. The Second World War was much more of a global conflict because =
the European war evolved into a massive fight in the Pacific. If, however, =
by a world war you mean simply a confrontation between great powers, I also=
 find that unlikely. The limitation on a war between great powers is the ex=
istence of nuclear weapons, and the principle that prevented a world war du=
ring the Cold War was mutual assured destruction. No nation is prepared for=
 nuclear war with another nuclear power because of that principle and reali=
ty. Wars between Russia, China and the United States have the real potentia=
l of being catastrophic for all. So we will see many strongly worded statem=
ents, and an entire generation of diplomats making a good living.</p>
