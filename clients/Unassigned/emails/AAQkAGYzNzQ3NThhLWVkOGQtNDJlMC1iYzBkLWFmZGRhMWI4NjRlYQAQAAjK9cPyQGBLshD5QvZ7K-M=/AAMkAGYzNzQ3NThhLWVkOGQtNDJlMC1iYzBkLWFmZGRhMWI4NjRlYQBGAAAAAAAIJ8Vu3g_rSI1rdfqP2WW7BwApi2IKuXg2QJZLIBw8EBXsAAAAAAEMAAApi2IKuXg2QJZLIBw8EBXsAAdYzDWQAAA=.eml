HOW HEZBOLLAH CONTROLLED LEBANESE SHIITES [3]
THE GROUP IS FACING AN EXISTENTIAL DILEMMA.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Hezbollah originated in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon. Iran had sent a contingent of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps there to fight the Israeli army, but it instead headed to the city of
Baalbek, where it formally announced Hezbollah’s establishment in 1985. Following Israel's assassination of Hezbollah chief Abbas Musawi in 1992, the party's Consultative Council elected Hassan
Nasrallah as his successor. Under Nasrallah’s charismatic leadership, Hezbollah became the dominant political movement among Lebanese Shiites. Hezbollah grew phenomenally, literally forming a state
within the Lebanese state that came with an armed wing, a substantial bureaucracy and a wide array of public services, including a separate banking sector that operated outside the international
banking system.
Hezbollah’s reputation was derived primarily from its armed wing, which was seen as an efficient military machine that compared favorably with the militaries of midsized countries. However, after
its defeat in the war with Israel in 2024, the group now faces a dilemma: It must disarm to avoid the resumption of war, but disarming would cause it to wither away as a political party. This prospect
is precisely why some Hezbollah leaders would rather fight a suicidal war instead of suffering the indignity of losing their military. And this is a sentiment shared by many Shiites – despite the
fact that they blame Hezbollah for the destruction that befell them in 2024.
THREATS OF ANOTHER WAR
A few days ago, Saudi Deputy Foreign Minister Yazid bin Farhan rushed to Beirut to strongly encourage Lebanese officials to honor their commitment to disarm Hezbollah. He warned them that Israel had a
green light from U.S. President Donald Trump to attack Lebanon again if Hezbollah did not abide by its commitments. Following his visit, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack arrived in Beirut. He emphasized that
Hezbollah's disarmament is an internal Lebanese issue, hinting that the U.S. would not engage in dialogue with Hezbollah on the matter and that there would be dire consequences for circumventing it.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who represents Hezbollah in talks with U.S. and Saudi officials, stipulated that Israel must withdraw from the five points it occupied in its recent war
against Hezbollah. He also insisted on halting Israel's daily targeting of Hezbollah operatives, as well as all other violations, and demanded strict U.S. guarantees that Israel would not violate
Lebanese territory after Hezbollah disarms.
Hezbollah seeks to negotiate with Washington, as it did with Germany in 2000. Though the group has rejected the idea that it wants to negotiate with the U.S., it has, in fact, engaged its Lebanese
allies to open channels of communication with the Trump administration. Hezbollah believes that dealing with Washington will give it a sense of legitimacy and confirm its role as a regional player. It
also believes the U.S. could provide security guarantees – hence the reason Hezbollah linked disarmament through guarantees via direct negotiation. Hezbollah understands that if it surrenders its
weapons, it will lose its political power. (Some influential figures in Hezbollah privately claim that they will not negotiate over their weapons under any circumstances.) The U.S. has maintained a
policy of not engaging in negotiations with Hezbollah, indirectly or otherwise. The U.S. firmly believes that the Lebanese government should take on this task directly.
HEZBOLLAH'S EVASIVE TACTICS
The pressure to disarm Hezbollah has increased dramatically since 2024. War with Israel left the group decimated, and Syrian leader Bashar Assad, a fellow client of Iran, was overthrown. Hezbollah’s
goal, then, is to become part of a national defense strategy by integrating it into the Lebanese military apparatus, similar to what the Popular Mobilization Forces did in Iraq. Hezbollah says it is
willing to discuss the future of its military component with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun if Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon and ceases its strikes, though it has yet to specify the nature of
that future.
After Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah expressed willingness to discuss the future of its weapons within the framework of a national defense strategy. However, Lebanese
rivals concluded that Hezbollah was simply maneuvering and would not accept disarmament, leading to the suspension of meetings on formulating a national defense strategy. Hezbollah's categorical
refusal to disarm led to its occupation of Beirut in 2008 and the elimination of the Sunni militia of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri.
Sources close to Hezbollah say it is considering discussing the transferal of heavy weapons, including drones and anti-tank missiles, north of the Litani River to the Lebanese army. While Washington
insists on Hezbollah's complete disarmament by the end of September 2025, its leaders have rejected the idea of discussing a timetable. When Aoun met with a Hezbollah delegation as part of the
dialogue to implement the ceasefire terms, the head of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc insisted on a series of demands upon which disarmament would depend. These demands included a complete Israeli
withdrawal and a halt to assassinations, the release of all prisoners of war held by Israel, and the creation of a comprehensive program to rebuild areas destroyed by the war. Despite Hezbollah's
evasiveness, Aoun insists on dealing with its weapons realistically, without ignoring internal sectarian balances, to avoid risking civil war.
Hezbollah has always felt that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) hindered its activities in the region, and it has long hoped that the U.N. Security Council would discontinue its
presence in Lebanon. Therefore, Hezbollah supporters regularly attack UNIFIL units to convince them that they are unwanted. In December 2022, Hezbollah members killed an Irish soldier, but a Lebanese
military tribunal bowed to pressure from Hezbollah to release the killer (because he allegedly had cancer). The most serious attack on UNIFIL occurred in 2007, resulting in the deaths of six Spanish
soldiers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but many blamed extremist groups close to Hezbollah. Hezbollah considers UNIFIL a spy agency colluding with Israel, a Western tool used to
monitor and limit its capabilities. When Lebanese authorities prevented Iranian aircraft from landing at the airport in Beirut, Hezbollah supporters set fire to a UNIFIL vehicle, assaulted a UNIFIL
member and stole his cash.
DISILLUSION
Most Shiites now realize that Iran used them as pawns in its proxy regional wars. Serving Tehran's failed regional ambitions exacted a heavy toll on them, corrupting their worldview and distorting
their perception of reality. Since Hezbollah's crushing defeat, many Shiites have asked how Hezbollah played with their minds and led them to this bitter end.
From its beginnings in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has used its military forces and its propaganda machine to convince Shiites that it is their protector. Hezbollah has used the concept of the
Guardianship of the Jurist, which recognizes the religious authority of the supreme guardian of religious and political society (Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei),
to legitimize its existence and its subordination to the Iranian regime and to marginalize its Shiite opponents. Hezbollah also dubbed its military activity the Islamic Resistance, bestowing upon it
an aura of sanctity and invincibility, which helped it engineer the social and cultural climate in Shiite society through its ideology.
Hezbollah has established organizational structures to consolidate its control over the Shiite community. It has established social, educational, health, cultural and financial institutions that
benefit only its members, making it a parallel entity to the state. It also established a police security system as a fundamental pillar of its control over Shiite society. Meanwhile, it has
established an unofficial security apparatus, known as al-Ahali (the people), which carries out the secretary-general's instructions and operates at his behest. It acts as a civilian paramilitary
force operating on the ground to disperse protests and demonstrations and to deliver strategic or political messages.
Hezbollah's security apparatus has instilled a climate of fear and repression in Shiite society, preventing the growth or expansion of any opposition movement or dissenting opinion. It devised and
generalized dualities across Shiite society, such as the resistor (committed to God's war project) versus the traitor (opposed to its project). Since its founding, Hezbollah has established a
repressive, authoritarian regime in Shiite society, controlling the minds of its members not only by refusing to accept other opinions but also by using the harshest means of coercion, suppression and
elimination.
STUCK WITH HEZBOLLAH
The disastrous consequences of Hezbollah's Gaza solidarity front have raised questions about the extent to which the Shiites will continue supporting it. Despite the devastation, killing and
displacement they have suffered, most Shiites still support Hezbollah, even if they resent its policies. Shiites believe they are in the throes of an existential threat, especially after the events on
the Syrian coast following the fall Assad, the massacres that befell the Alawites and their political marginalization.
Despite their criticism of Hezbollah's choices, the Shiites seem determined to support it and trust its ability to recover and rebuild its capabilities and leadership. Shiites, even unreligious ones
like secularists, atheists and those who have not gained from its material and social benefits, continue to support Hezbollah. They believe that abandoning it at this critical moment in history will
turn other sects against them, as happened to the Alawites in Syria. They therefore see their relationship with Hezbollah as an alliance of necessity, regardless of the results. As the conflict
throughout the country continues, Lebanon once again appears at a dangerous crossroads, one in which it will either submit to international pressure regarding Hezbollah's weapons or slide into a
military confrontation that could be even bloodier than previous conflicts.
Hezbollah is in a state of unprecedented exhaustion. The technological gap between it and Israel has widened, and its security infrastructure has suffered severe blows with the assassination of first-
and second-tier leaders. Iran has substantially reduced its financial support, leaving it unable to pay salaries and compensation to those affected by the recent war. Despite this decline, Hezbollah
still maintains an organizational structure and security influence within the state, thanks to the absence of any serious Shiite political alternative that could fill the void left by Hezbollah's
decline.
Lebanon faces the challenge of implementing a plan to establish a state monopoly on arms possession by the end of September or risk a large-scale military escalation. The country's future is now a
regional and international concern. Hezbollah refuses to back down, the government is unable to impose its authority, and the U.S. and Israel are losing patience. Amid all this, the Lebanese people,
especially the Shiites, are the biggest victims. Hezbollah has succeeded only in destroying the political and social foundations of its sectarian base of support, just as authoritarian Arab regimes
did to their peoples. Lebanese Shiites will need several years to recover.

Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps there to fight the Israeli army, but it i=
nstead headed to the city of Baalbek, where it formally announced Hezbollah=
=E2=80=99s establishment in 1985. Following Israel's assassination of Hezbo=
llah chief Abbas Musawi in 1992, the party's Consultative Council elected H=
assan Nasrallah as his successor. Under Nasrallah=E2=80=99s charismatic lea=
dership, Hezbollah became the dominant political movement among Lebanese Sh=
iites. Hezbollah grew phenomenally, literally forming a state within the Le=
banese state that came with an armed wing, a substantial bureaucracy and a =
wide array of public services, including a separate banking sector that ope=
rated outside the international banking system.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah=E2=80=99=
s reputation was derived primarily from its armed wing, which was seen as a=
n efficient military machine that compared favorably with the militaries of=
 midsized countries. However, after its defeat in the war with Israel in 20=
24, the group now faces a dilemma: It must disarm to avoid the resumption o=
f war, but disarming would cause it to wither away as a political party. Th=
is prospect is precisely why some Hezbollah leaders would rather fight a su=
icidal war instead of suffering the indignity of losing their military. And=
 this is a sentiment shared by many Shiites =E2=80=93 despite the fact that=
 they blame Hezbollah for the destruction that befell them in 2024.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Threats of=
 Another War</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A few days ago, Sa=
udi Deputy Foreign Minister Yazid bin Farhan rushed to Beirut to strongly e=
ncourage Lebanese officials to honor their commitment to disarm Hezbollah. =
He warned them that Israel had a green light from U.S. President Donald Tru=
mp to attack Lebanon again if Hezbollah did not abide by its commitments. F=
ollowing his visit, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack arrived in Beirut. He emphasized=
 that Hezbollah's disarmament is an internal Lebanese issue, hinting that t=
he U.S. would not engage in dialogue with Hezbollah on the matter and that =
there would be dire consequences for circumventing it. Lebanese parliament =
speaker Nabih Berri, who represents Hezbollah in talks with U.S. and Saudi =
officials, stipulated that Israel must withdraw from the five points it occ=
upied in its recent war against Hezbollah. He also insisted on halting Isra=
el's daily targeting of Hezbollah operatives, as well as all other violatio=
ns, and demanded strict U.S. guarantees that Israel would not violate Leban=
ese territory after Hezbollah disarms.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah seeks to=
 negotiate with Washington, as it did with Germany in 2000. Though the grou=
p has rejected the idea that it wants to negotiate with the U.S., it has, i=
n fact, engaged its Lebanese allies to open channels of communication with =
the Trump administration. Hezbollah believes that dealing with Washington w=
ill give it a sense of legitimacy and confirm its role as a regional player=
. It also believes the U.S. could provide security guarantees =E2=80=93 hen=
ce the reason Hezbollah linked disarmament through guarantees via direct ne=
gotiation. Hezbollah understands that if it surrenders its weapons, it will=
 lose its political power. (Some influential figures in Hezbollah privately=
 claim that they will not negotiate over their weapons under any circumstan=
ces.) The U.S. has maintained a policy of not engaging in negotiations with=
 Hezbollah, indirectly or otherwise. The U.S. firmly believes that the Leba=
nese government should take on this task directly.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Hezbollah'=
s Evasive Tactics</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The pressure to di=
sarm Hezbollah has increased dramatically since 2024. War with Israel left =
the group decimated, and Syrian leader Bashar Assad, a fellow client of Ira=
n, was overthrown. Hezbollah=E2=80=99s goal, then, is to become part of a n=
ational defense strategy by integrating it into the Lebanese military appar=
atus, similar to what the Popular Mobilization Forces did in Iraq. Hezbolla=
h says it is willing to discuss the future of its military component with L=
ebanese President Joseph Aoun if Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon and=
 ceases its strikes, though it has yet to specify the nature of that future=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">After Israel's wit=
hdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah expressed willingness to d=
iscuss the future of its weapons within the framework of a national defense=
 strategy. However, Lebanese rivals concluded that Hezbollah was simply man=
euvering and would not accept disarmament, leading to the suspension of mee=
tings on formulating a national defense strategy. Hezbollah's categorical r=
efusal to disarm led to its occupation of Beirut in 2008 and the eliminatio=
n of the Sunni militia of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Sources close to H=
ezbollah say it is considering discussing the transferal of heavy weapons, =
including drones and anti-tank missiles, north of the Litani River to the L=
ebanese army. While Washington insists on Hezbollah's complete disarmament =
by the end of September 2025, its leaders have rejected the idea of discuss=
ing a timetable. When Aoun met with a Hezbollah delegation as part of the d=
ialogue to implement the ceasefire terms, the head of Hezbollah's parliamen=
tary bloc insisted on a series of demands upon which disarmament would depe=
nd. These demands included a complete Israeli withdrawal and a halt to assa=
ssinations, the release of all prisoners of war held by Israel, and the cre=
ation of a comprehensive program to rebuild areas destroyed by the war. Des=
pite Hezbollah's evasiveness, Aoun insists on dealing with its weapons real=
istically, without ignoring internal sectarian balances, to avoid risking c=
ivil war.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah has alwa=
ys felt that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) hindered =
its activities in the region, and it has long hoped that the U.N. Security =
Council would discontinue its presence in Lebanon. Therefore, Hezbollah sup=
porters regularly attack UNIFIL units to convince them that they are unwant=
ed. In December 2022, Hezbollah members killed an Irish soldier, but a Leba=
nese military tribunal bowed to pressure from Hezbollah to release the kill=
er (because he allegedly had cancer). The most serious attack on UNIFIL occ=
urred in 2007, resulting in the deaths of six Spanish soldiers. No group cl=
aimed responsibility for the attack, but many blamed extremist groups close=
 to Hezbollah. Hezbollah considers UNIFIL a spy agency colluding with Israe=
l, a Western tool used to monitor and limit its capabilities. When Lebanese=
 authorities prevented Iranian aircraft from landing at the airport in Beir=
ut, Hezbollah supporters set fire to a UNIFIL vehicle, assaulted a UNIFIL m=
ember and stole his cash.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Disillusio=
n</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Most Shiites now r=
ealize that Iran used them as pawns in its proxy regional wars. Serving Teh=
ran's failed regional ambitions exacted a heavy toll on them, corrupting th=
eir worldview and distorting their perception of reality. Since Hezbollah's=
 crushing defeat, many Shiites have asked how Hezbollah played with their m=
inds and led them to this bitter end.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">From its beginning=
s in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has used its military forces and its propag=
anda machine to convince Shiites that it is their protector. Hezbollah has =
used the concept of the Guardianship of the Jurist, which recognizes the re=
ligious authority of the supreme guardian of religious and political societ=
y (Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei), =
to legitimize its existence and its subordination to the Iranian regime and=
 to marginalize its Shiite opponents. Hezbollah also dubbed its military ac=
tivity the Islamic Resistance, bestowing upon it an aura of sanctity and in=
vincibility, which helped it engineer the social and cultural climate in Sh=
iite society through its ideology.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah has esta=
blished organizational structures to consolidate its control over the Shiit=
e community. It has established social, educational, health, cultural and f=
inancial institutions that benefit only its members, making it a parallel e=
ntity to the state. It also established a police security system as a funda=
mental pillar of its control over Shiite society. Meanwhile, it has establi=
shed an unofficial security apparatus, known as al-Ahali (the people), whic=
h carries out the secretary-general's instructions and operates at his behe=
st. It acts as a civilian paramilitary force operating on the ground to dis=
perse protests and demonstrations and to deliver strategic or political mes=
sages.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah's securi=
ty apparatus has instilled a climate of fear and repression in Shiite socie=
ty, preventing the growth or expansion of any opposition movement or dissen=
ting opinion. It devised and generalized dualities across Shiite society, s=
uch as the resistor (committed to God's war project) versus the traitor (op=
posed to its project). Since its founding, Hezbollah has established a repr=
essive, authoritarian regime in Shiite society, controlling the minds of it=
s members not only by refusing to accept other opinions but also by using t=
he harshest means of coercion, suppression and elimination.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Stuck with=
 Hezbollah</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The disastrous con=
sequences of Hezbollah's Gaza solidarity front have raised questions about =
the extent to which the Shiites will continue supporting it. Despite the de=
vastation, killing and displacement they have suffered, most Shiites still =
support Hezbollah, even if they resent its policies. Shiites believe they a=
re in the throes of an existential threat, especially after the events on t=
he Syrian coast following the fall Assad, the massacres that befell the Ala=
wites and their political marginalization.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite their crit=
icism of Hezbollah's choices, the Shiites seem determined to support it and=
 trust its ability to recover and rebuild its capabilities and leadership. =
Shiites, even unreligious ones like secularists, atheists and those who hav=
e not gained from its material and social benefits, continue to support Hez=
bollah. They believe that abandoning it at this critical moment in history =
will turn other sects against them, as happened to the Alawites in Syria. T=
hey therefore see their relationship with Hezbollah as an alliance of neces=
sity, regardless of the results. As the conflict throughout the country con=
tinues, Lebanon once again appears at a dangerous crossroads, one in which =
it will either submit to international pressure regarding Hezbollah's weapo=
ns or slide into a military confrontation that could be even bloodier than =
previous conflicts.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah is in a =
state of unprecedented exhaustion. The technological gap between it and Isr=
ael has widened, and its security infrastructure has suffered severe blows =
with the assassination of first- and second-tier leaders. Iran has substant=
ially reduced its financial support, leaving it unable to pay salaries and =
compensation to those affected by the recent war. Despite this decline, Hez=
bollah still maintains an organizational structure and security influence w=
ithin the state, thanks to the absence of any serious Shiite political alte=
rnative that could fill the void left by Hezbollah's decline.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Lebanon faces the =
challenge of implementing a plan to establish a state monopoly on arms poss=
ession by the end of September or risk a large-scale military escalation. T=
he country's future is now a regional and international concern. Hezbollah =
refuses to back down, the government is unable to impose its authority, and=
 the U.S. and Israel are losing patience. Amid all this, the Lebanese peopl=
e, especially the Shiites, are the biggest victims. Hezbollah has succeeded=
 only in destroying the political and social foundations of its sectarian b=
ase of support, just as authoritarian Arab regimes did to their peoples. Le=
banese Shiites will need several years to recover.</p>
