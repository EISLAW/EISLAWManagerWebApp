NEW BATTLEGROUNDS IN INFORMATION WARFARE [3]
INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS CAN BE AS BIG A THREAT TO NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AS MILITARY CAMPAIGNS.
BY: RONAN WORDSWORTH
The concept of disinformation isn’t new; it’s been around as long as information has. The difference between then and now is that now there are more, and arguably more effective, avenues for
controlling public opinion. And there are more people trying to control it. In addition to large media organizations, which can, to varying degrees, cooperate with the state, virtually anyone can try
to control information. As a result, trust in institutions has been eroded, democratic processes have been undermined, perceptions have been altered, and societies have been conditioned to be
disillusioned throughout the world. Governments have realized that information campaigns can be as big a threat to national sovereignty as military campaigns.
ADOPTION AND DEPLOYMENT
Foreign information manipulation and interference, or FIMI, has been recognized as a growing security threat. One small but significant component of FIMI is disinformation – that is, misleading
content that is meant to deceive. This is not to be confused with misinformation: information that is merely inaccurate. Both, however, can affect public health, subvert attempts to address certain
challenges, destabilize societies, shape narratives and undermine adversaries.
As the use of FIMI becomes more frequent, governments increasingly lack the tools to adequately counter it. It’s no easy task; education in, say, media literacy typically lags behind new forms of
FIMI. But the bottom line is that as the threat matrix grows, so do the risks of inaction. Russia was perhaps the earliest and most high-profile proponent of mass-scale disinformation operations, and
though they are especially useful to authoritarian regimes acting against democratic adversaries, countless state and non-state actors weaponize FIMI as a tool of asymmetric warfare.
There are many reasons for engaging in disinformation. One is to sow division and discord. When done properly, it is invaluable. It can turn citizens against each other, undermine trust in otherwise
trusted groups and institutions, influence the outcomes of elections and shape government policy. Another reason is to promote positive narratives for preferred figures. Russia frequently attempts to
undermine the credibility of pro-Europe leaders and promote pro-Russia ones.
In fact, Russia is a logical starting point in looking for examples of information warfare. Through coordinated operations by state and pro-Kremlin affiliates, Moscow was one of the earliest adopters
of social media for large-scale disinformation activities. Whether on Facebook, X/Twitter, WhatsApp or, now, video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, disinformation campaigns have also become
increasingly sophisticated.
The strategy is as important as the message. Russia, for instance, has a tried and true method for waging information warfare. First, it creates a narrative or specific angle of attack. Rather than
being an outright lie, the message is usually based on a kernel of truth that taps into local grievances and thus appears legitimate. This can take the form of doctored images, memes, fabricated
statistics and completely misleading headlines. Once the content is created, the message is amplified by pushing the narrative, over and over, in a process called “flooding the zone.”
The narratives are often picked up by others, including state-controlled media accounts, troll farms, private entities' social media channels and paid local influencers. They are also spread liberally
across as many platforms as possible to help amplify the message and give it credibility. Meanwhile, the person or group that issued the disinformation often sends out competing narratives to
overwhelm its targets with content. This further obfuscates the truth by normalizing more “moderate” accounts of an otherwise extreme narrative. Crucially, support for these messages can develop
organically through local influencers who actually believe the false narrative. Multipronged strategies like these necessarily have a built-in layer of plausible deniability for whoever issued the
disinformation.
Other countries follow similar playbooks, of course, while some use their own. China, for example, tends to use disinformation as a piece in a larger campaign that includes cyber threats, intimidation
of critical voices with transnational repression and economic coercion – all in the service of pushing pro-Beijing narratives and silencing critics. Though it’s not as ubiquitous as Russia, China
has been ready to deploy voices when needed to change the narrative on particular topics, especially those around the COVID-19 pandemic and Taiwan.
GEOPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES
The mass adoption of FIMI operations has a number of direct consequences, perhaps the most important of which is that it doesn’t require a ton of material capability to carry out. In more concrete
terms, however, Russian activity is instructive because it has been wildly successful and because it offers two helpful use cases: disrupting internal stability in the domestic markets of Western
countries and undermining the West as part of a broader competition for influence in the so-called Global South.
Indeed, Africa has become arguably one of the most frequent targets of FIMI operations [4] as many new actors emerge to compete for influence there, but Russia was sort of a pioneer in the modern
information warfare era. It started in the Central African Republic, then parlayed its successes over the past few years to the Sahel region, including Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and beyond. Many of
these countries had legitimate grievances with their former colonial master, France. These grievances were amplified such that the population demanded that French troops leave. It culminated in the
ouster of democratically elected governments by military juntas, ostensibly for being too pro-France. Local influencers were paid directly by Russian agents to push Kremlin talking points. Local media
outlets were chosen to amplify the message and ensure the domination of Moscow’s narrative in the information sphere.
There are many benefits for Russia. In exchange for providing soldiers (and mercenaries through private outfits like Africa Corps) to embattled juntas, Russia received significant mining rights
throughout the region. Burkina Faso, despite claims of nationalizing gold mines operated by Canadian and Australian companies, has signed a new agreement with Russian miner Nordgold to extract gold
from a new mine in Niou. The site is expected to yield over 20 tons of gold over the next eight years to the tune of approximately $2.1 billion. The government will receive just $89 million. This deal
is being celebrated in Burkina Faso as a liberation from colonial powers, but it’s hard to argue that it’s any less exploitative.
Likewise, new Russian mining licenses are being granted in Mali and Niger, demonstrating the large return on investment achieved through FIMI. Along with the Central African Republic, the three
Sahelian states now have very popular public opinions of Russian intervention, even as internal security has weakened by every conceivable metric.
Notably, there are structural factors that make the Sahel especially vulnerable to Russian influence. They include low media and digital literacy in rural areas, insufficient traditional media
sources, a population only relatively recently introduced to the internet, the proliferation of chat groups on platforms like WhatsApp, a high level of trust in informal channels of media, and
distrust in institutions thanks to years of neglect by successive governments.
[Disinformation Campaigns in Africa] [5]
_(click to enlarge) [6]_
Recent events in Romania are similarly illustrative. The presidential election last year featured a relative unknown outsider named Calin Georgescu, who rose to prominence and topped the polls in a
major surprise to observers and established parties alike. The constitutional court annulled the election results after intelligence documents revealed a targeted Russian influence operation was
promoting Georgescu. And it just so happened that he favored closer relations with Moscow than with Brussels.
Here again, Russia was able to effectively leverage an existing discontent with the status quo to promote an outsider who could have fundamentally altered Romania's democratic outlook. The campaign
was conducted via readily available media channels such as Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp. In other words, Moscow was almost able to fundamentally change the direction of Romania’s foreign policy
using a relatively paltry amount of resources.
This case was the first time a Western country was forced to take concrete and drastic steps to counter FIMI operations. But in a democratic country, this has consequences of its own. The people who
voted for Georgescu believe democracy was undermined by the court’s nullification of the election results, while the people who voted against him also believed they were undermined. Governments that
follow the example of Bucharest risk pushing more people to extreme parties, especially if they believe mainstream parties are working against them. (It’s important to note, too, that no one likes
to admit that they were duped. This entrenchment adds another layer of complexity to an already difficult problem.)
NEW RISKS
Over the past two years, the risk posed by FIMI has been made worse by generative AI and automation. Generative AI allows users to produce images and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from
reality. Large language models allow external actors to produce convincing content in many languages without needing to expend the time and resources to groom local assets or learn the language
otherwise. Similarly, automation is a vital tool for amplifying messages hundreds of times to “flood the zone” with information. Whereas before troll farms required thousands of employees to
produce fake or doctored content, they can now be mass-produced and distributed with minimal labor across multiple platforms.
FIMI is a risk that evolves in lockstep with new technologies. That one country can affect another’s elections for its own geostrategic ends is fundamentally an act of aggression and undermines the
entire democratic process. The solutions required are complex and long-term. Russian Chief of General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov has said that the world is moving to a “nonlinear battlefield,”
where psychological, informational and cognitive operations are just as decisive to outcomes as kinetic operations. Vulnerable groups are manipulated for a host of reasons, and the cost of doing so is
significantly lower than a conventional challenge to the status quo.
On a state level, the European Union is a leader in countering FIMI. These operations require more than just fact-checking; once the disinformation is out there, the damage is often already done.
Effective counteroperations require investment in media literacy, regulatory frameworks for tech platforms to prevent rapid dissemination, and coordinated intelligence sharing among allies who
understand the risks.

														</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The concept of dis=
information isn=E2=80=99t new; it=E2=80=99s been around as long as informat=
ion has. The difference between then and now is that now there are more, an=
d arguably more effective, avenues for controlling public opinion. And ther=
e are more people trying to control it. In addition to large media organiza=
tions, which can, to varying degrees, cooperate with the state, virtually a=
nyone can try to control information. As a result, trust in institutions ha=
s been eroded, democratic processes have been undermined, perceptions have =
been altered, and societies have been conditioned to be disillusioned throu=
ghout the world. Governments have realized that information campaigns can b=
e as big a threat to national sovereignty as military campaigns.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Adoption a=
nd Deployment</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Foreign informatio=
n manipulation and interference, or FIMI, has been recognized as a growing =
security threat. One small but significant component of FIMI is disinformat=
ion =E2=80=93 that is, misleading content that is meant to deceive. This is=
 not to be confused with misinformation: information that is merely inaccur=
ate. Both, however, can affect public health, subvert attempts to address c=
ertain challenges, destabilize societies, shape narratives and undermine ad=
versaries.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As the use of FIMI=
 becomes more frequent, governments increasingly lack the tools to adequate=
ly counter it. It=E2=80=99s no easy task; education in, say, media literacy=
 typically lags behind new forms of FIMI. But the bottom line is that as th=
e threat matrix grows, so do the risks of inaction. Russia was perhaps the =
earliest and most high-profile proponent of mass-scale disinformation opera=
tions, and though they are especially useful to authoritarian regimes actin=
g against democratic adversaries, countless state and non-state actors weap=
onize FIMI as a tool of asymmetric warfare.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There are many rea=
sons for engaging in disinformation. One is to sow division and discord. Wh=
en done properly, it is invaluable. It can turn citizens against each other=
, undermine trust in otherwise trusted groups and institutions, influence t=
he outcomes of elections and shape government policy. Another reason is to =
promote positive narratives for preferred figures. Russia frequently attemp=
ts to undermine the credibility of pro-Europe leaders and promote pro-Russi=
a ones.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In fact, Russia is=
 a logical starting point in looking for examples of information warfare. T=
hrough coordinated operations by state and pro-Kremlin affiliates, Moscow w=
as one of the earliest adopters of social media for large-scale disinformat=
ion activities. Whether on Facebook, X/Twitter, WhatsApp or, now, video pla=
tforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, disinformation campaigns have also =
become increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The strategy is as=
 important as the message. Russia, for instance, has a tried and true metho=
d for waging information warfare. First, it creates a narrative or specific=
 angle of attack. Rather than being an outright lie, the message is usually=
 based on a kernel of truth that taps into local grievances and thus appear=
s legitimate. This can take the form of doctored images, memes, fabricated =
statistics and completely misleading headlines. Once the content is created=
, the message is amplified by pushing the narrative, over and over, in a pr=
ocess called =E2=80=9Cflooding the zone.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The narratives are=
 often picked up by others, including state-controlled media accounts, trol=
l farms, private entities' social media channels and paid local influencers=
. They are also spread liberally across as many platforms as possible to he=
lp amplify the message and give it credibility. Meanwhile, the person or gr=
oup that issued the disinformation often sends out competing narratives to =
overwhelm its targets with content. This further obfuscates the truth by no=
rmalizing more =E2=80=9Cmoderate=E2=80=9D accounts of an otherwise extreme =
narrative. Crucially, support for these messages can develop organically th=
rough local influencers who actually believe the false narrative. Multipron=
ged strategies like these necessarily have a built-in layer of plausible de=
niability for whoever issued the disinformation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Other countries fo=
llow similar playbooks, of course, while some use their own. China, for exa=
mple, tends to use disinformation as a piece in a larger campaign that incl=
udes cyber threats, intimidation of critical voices with transnational repr=
ession and economic coercion =E2=80=93 all in the service of pushing pro-Be=
ijing narratives and silencing critics. Though it=E2=80=99s not as ubiquito=
us as Russia, China has been ready to deploy voices when needed to change t=
he narrative on particular topics, especially those around the COVID-19 pan=
demic and Taiwan.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Geopolitic=
al Consequences</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The mass adoption =
of FIMI operations has a number of direct consequences, perhaps the most im=
portant of which is that it doesn=E2=80=99t require a ton of material capab=
ility to carry out. In more concrete terms, however, Russian activity is in=
structive because it has been wildly successful and because it offers two h=
elpful use cases: disrupting internal stability in the domestic markets of =
Western countries and undermining the West as part of a broader competition=
 for influence in the so-called Global South.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Indeed,<a href=3D"=
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/401981/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fd=
cf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZnJpY2FjZW50ZXIub3JnL3Nwb3RsaWdodC9tYXBwaW5nLWEtc3VyZ2Utb=
2YtZGlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24taW4tYWZyaWNhLw" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decorati=
on:none;padding:2px 0px"> Africa has become arguably one of the most freque=
nt targets of FIMI operations</a> as many new actors emerge to compete for =
influence there, but Russia was sort of a pioneer in the modern information=
 warfare era. It started in the Central African Republic, then parlayed its=
 successes over the past few years to the Sahel region, including Mali, Bur=
kina Faso, Niger and beyond. Many of these countries had legitimate grievan=
ces with their former colonial master, France. These grievances were amplif=
ied such that the population demanded that French troops leave. It culminat=
ed in the ouster of democratically elected governments by military juntas, =
ostensibly for being too pro-France. Local influencers were paid directly b=
y Russian agents to push Kremlin talking points. Local media outlets were c=
hosen to amplify the message and ensure the domination of Moscow=E2=80=99s =
narrative in the information sphere.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There are many ben=
efits for Russia. In exchange for providing soldiers (and mercenaries throu=
gh private outfits like Africa Corps) to embattled juntas, Russia received =
significant mining rights throughout the region. Burkina Faso, despite clai=
ms of nationalizing gold mines operated by Canadian and Australian companie=
s, has signed a new agreement with Russian miner Nordgold to extract gold f=
rom a new mine in Niou. The site is expected to yield over 20 tons of gold =
over the next eight years to the tune of approximately $2.1 billion. The go=
vernment will receive just $89 million. This deal is being celebrated in Bu=
rkina Faso as a liberation from colonial powers, but it=E2=80=99s hard to a=
rgue that it=E2=80=99s any less exploitative.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Likewise, new Russ=
ian mining licenses are being granted in Mali and Niger, demonstrating the =
large return on investment achieved through FIMI. Along with the Central Af=
rican Republic, the three Sahelian states now have very popular public opin=
ions of Russian intervention, even as internal security has weakened by eve=
ry conceivable metric.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Notably, there are=
 structural factors that make the Sahel especially vulnerable to Russian in=
fluence. They include low media and digital literacy in rural areas, insuff=
icient traditional media sources, a population only relatively recently int=
roduced to the internet, the proliferation of chat groups on platforms like=
 WhatsApp, a high level of trust in informal channels of media, and distrus=
t in institutions thanks to years of neglect by successive governments.</p>

</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Recent events in R=
omania are similarly illustrative. The presidential election last year feat=
ured a relative unknown outsider named Calin Georgescu, who rose to promine=
nce and topped the polls in a major surprise to observers and established p=
arties alike. The constitutional court annulled the election results after =
intelligence documents revealed a targeted Russian influence operation was =
promoting Georgescu. And it just so happened that he favored closer relatio=
ns with Moscow than with Brussels.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Here again, Russia=
 was able to effectively leverage an existing discontent with the status qu=
o to promote an outsider who could have fundamentally altered Romania's dem=
ocratic outlook. The campaign was conducted via readily available media cha=
nnels such as Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp. In other words, Moscow was al=
most able to fundamentally change the direction of Romania=E2=80=99s foreig=
n policy using a relatively paltry amount of resources.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This case was the =
first time a Western country was forced to take concrete and drastic steps =
to counter FIMI operations. But in a democratic country, this has consequen=
ces of its own. The people who voted for Georgescu believe democracy was un=
dermined by the court=E2=80=99s nullification of the election results, whil=
e the people who voted against him also believed they were undermined. Gove=
rnments that follow the example of Bucharest risk pushing more people to ex=
treme parties, especially if they believe mainstream parties are working ag=
ainst them. (It=E2=80=99s important to note, too, that no one likes to admi=
t that they were duped. This entrenchment adds another layer of complexity =
to an already difficult problem.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>New Risks<=
/strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Over the past two =
years, the risk posed by FIMI has been made worse by generative AI and auto=
mation. Generative AI allows users to produce images and videos that are ne=
arly indistinguishable from reality. Large language models allow external a=
ctors to produce convincing content in many languages without needing to ex=
pend the time and resources to groom local assets or learn the language oth=
erwise. Similarly, automation is a vital tool for amplifying messages hundr=
eds of times to =E2=80=9Cflood the zone=E2=80=9D with information. Whereas =
before troll farms required thousands of employees to produce fake or docto=
red content, they can now be mass-produced and distributed with minimal lab=
or across multiple platforms.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">FIMI is a risk tha=
t evolves in lockstep with new technologies. That one country can affect an=
other=E2=80=99s elections for its own geostrategic ends is fundamentally an=
 act of aggression and undermines the entire democratic process. The soluti=
ons required are complex and long-term. Russian Chief of General Staff&nbsp=
;Gen. Valery Gerasimov has said that the world is moving to a =E2=80=9Cnonl=
inear battlefield,=E2=80=9D where psychological, informational and cognitiv=
e operations are just as decisive to outcomes as kinetic operations. Vulner=
able groups are manipulated for a host of reasons, and the cost of doing so=
 is significantly lower than a conventional challenge to the status quo.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On a state level, =
the European Union is a leader in countering FIMI. These operations require=
 more than just fact-checking; once the disinformation is out there, the da=
mage is often already done. Effective counteroperations require investment =
in media literacy, regulatory frameworks for tech platforms to prevent rapi=
d dissemination, and coordinated intelligence sharing among allies who unde=
rstand the risks.</p>
