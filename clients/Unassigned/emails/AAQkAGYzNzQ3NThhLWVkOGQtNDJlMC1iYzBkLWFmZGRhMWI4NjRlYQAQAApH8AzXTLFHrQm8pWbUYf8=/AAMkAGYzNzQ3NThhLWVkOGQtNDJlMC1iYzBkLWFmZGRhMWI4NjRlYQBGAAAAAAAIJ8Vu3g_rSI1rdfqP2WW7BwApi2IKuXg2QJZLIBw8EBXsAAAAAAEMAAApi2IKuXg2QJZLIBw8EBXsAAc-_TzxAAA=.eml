In a little over two years, we=E2=80=99ve gone from being surprised that AI=
 can write entire paragraphs to confidently expecting that AI will disrupt =
our economy, change work as we know it, and perhaps even change the evoluti=
onary curve of our species.
That is a pretty darn big jump in expectations. In fact, I=E2=80=99ve never=
 seen one higher. Here are just a few of the hype quotes around AI recently=
:
Sam Altman (OpenAI, Snowflake Summit =E2=80=93 June 2025):
=E2=80=9CI would bet next year that, at least in some limited cases, we=E2=
=80=99ll start to see agents that can help us discover new knowledge and so=
lve business problems.=E2=80=9D
Jensen Huang (NVIDIA, CES 2025 keynote):
=E2=80=9CThe ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner.=
=E2=80=9D
Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind, Big Technology interview =E2=80=93 Jan 202=
5):
=E2=80=9CI think we=E2=80=99re probably three to five years away=E2=80=9D f=
rom AGI.
Dario Amodei (Anthropic, Davos panel =E2=80=93 Jan 2025):
=E2=80=9CBy 2026 or 2027, we will have AI systems that are broadly better t=
han almost all humans at almost all things.=E2=80=9D
Elon Musk (xAI, World Government Summit =E2=80=93 Feb 2025):
=E2=80=9CGrok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities=E2=80=A6 in our te=
sts so far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that=E2=80=99s been released.=
=E2=80=9D
Mustafa Suleyman (Microsoft AI, Decoder podcast =E2=80=93 May 2025):
=E2=80=9CMost human knowledge work in the next five to ten years could like=
ly be performed by one of the AI systems we develop.=E2=80=9D
You see what I mean. Big hype here.=20
The problem is it=E2=80=99s not at all clear that what we have with AI toda=
y is by itself enough to get to AGI. Let me give you a few examples to make=
 this tangible:
Messy Context: You want to get some insights from a gigantic spreadsheet. I=
t=E2=80=99s marketing metrics, and you have about 5 tabs, a bunch of macros=
 and complicated formulas, and the person before you built it. You need to =
figure out how to look across all 5 tabs to troubleshoot a metric. Then whe=
n it=E2=80=99s right, you have to build a report. Then you have to provide =
analysis and recommendations off that report for next month=E2=80=99s spend=
=2E AI is supposed to help, but even o3=
 chokes on a 5 tab sheet. Maybe there=20=
are specialized tools somewhere, but you don=E2=80=99t have time to go find=
 them before the marketing meeting. You throw up your hands and start just =
working on it directly.
Long Horizon Intent: You get called into your Director=E2=80=99s office. =
=E2=80=9CHey, remember that webinar from April 2023? The one we did with re=
cord attendance? Can you have a look at that and figure out what went right=
 there? I know you were here. I want you to come back with a webinar plan t=
hat actually reflects what we did well, because I was taking a look at the =
numbers an this last two years has just been a steady decline.=E2=80=9D You=
 wonder why he didn=E2=80=99t beef about it sooner, swear under your breath=
, and try to use AI to help you search the Notion, Jira, Slack, anything fo=
r context. You find fragmentary records here and there. Nothing that=E2=80=
=99s a narrative. So you go talk to an old-timer. Someone who has been here=
 since 2019. She immediately recalls exactly what happened, and you complet=
e your report successfully based on her input.
Adaptable Learning and Memory: You have an AI agent that=E2=80=99s supposed=
 to learn your inbox patterns and respond intelligently in your voice. You =
find you=E2=80=99re constantly tweaking the system prompt that gets it to =
=E2=80=9Cwrite in your voice=E2=80=9D and it never feels quite right. No ma=
tter how many emails of yours the agent reads, you don=E2=80=99t see it get=
ting from 80% to 98% on your voice. Eventually you give up, because 80% goo=
d on an email you have to rewrite isn=E2=80=99t really saving you time.
These are all real problems. They aren=E2=80=99t easy to solve. And none of=
 them get solved in immediately obvious ways by Reinforcement Learning (RL)=
 and inference alone. So what=E2=80=99s left? Read on (and watch on) for a =
breakout of who=E2=80=99s sounding notes of caution about the inevitability=
 of AGI, and a deeper discussion of the hard problems we still need to solv=
e in order to truly unlock AGI. Spoiler alert: it=E2=80=99s not inevitable,=
 and we will see it coming.=20
Subscribers get all these pieces!
The path to AGI: highway or potholed track?
For years, the AI community has treated progress toward artificial general =
intelligence (AGI) as a smooth curve =E2=80=94 just keep scaling data and c=
ompute, polish the inference tricks, and the destination will appear on sch=
edule. Yet the conversation is shifting. Two influential voices=E2=80=94Alp=
habet CEO Sundar Pichai and podcaster-analyst Dwarkesh Patel=E2=80=94are pu=
blicly questioning the =E2=80=9Cstraight-line=E2=80=9D assumption, arguing =
that the remaining terrain is steeper, stranger, and far less certain than =
the hype suggests.
Speaking at Bloomberg=E2=80=99s Tech conference today, Pichai delivered a m=
easured reality check. While praising the =E2=80=9Cstaggering=E2=80=9D pace=
 of recent breakthroughs, he cautioned that the field may soon confront gen=
uine limits. =E2=80=9CSo are we currently on an absolute path to AGI? I don=
=E2=80=99t think anyone can say for sure,=E2=80=9D he said, noting that eve=
n Google could hit a plateau where new ideas=E2=80=94not just bigger models=
=E2=80=94are required to move the needle . His remark echoes earlier commen=
ts about the =E2=80=9Clow-hanging fruit=E2=80=9D of scale already being pic=
ked and the need for deeper innovations in reasoning and long-horizon plann=
ing.
Dwarkesh Patel voices a complementary skepticism from the builder=E2=80=99s=
 perspective. After hundreds of hours trying (and failing) to make LLMs fun=
ction as reliable teammates, he now gives less than 50 percent odds that to=
day=E2=80=99s systems can replace large swaths of white-collar labor withou=
t a breakthrough in continual, on-the-job learning. =E2=80=9CIf AI progress=
 totally stalls today, I think < 50 % of white-collar employment goes away,=
=E2=80=9D he wrote this week, citing models=E2=80=99 inability to accumulat=
e context or improve the way human employees do . Patel=E2=80=99s timelines=
 for =E2=80=9CAI that actually learns like a colleague=E2=80=9D stretch wel=
l into the 2030s, puncturing the near-term exuberance common on tech podcas=
ts and investor decks.
Taken together, Pichai=E2=80=99s strategic caution and Patel=E2=80=99s hand=
s-on frustrations spotlight the same gap: scaling alone can=E2=80=99t bridg=
e the distance between clever autocomplete and a true AGI colleague. Their =
warnings set the stage for a broader conversation about what breakthroughs=
=E2=80=94memory architectures, adaptive reward systems, embodied experience=
, or something still unimagined=E2=80=94must come next, and why betting sol=
ely on more data and bigger GPUs could leave the industry stranded halfway =
up the mountain.
What still needs to be solved?
AI progress over the past two years has been driven almost exclusively by t=
wo levers: ever-larger pre-training corpora and increasingly sophisticated =
inference techniques. Those gains feel spectacular=E2=80=94models write cod=
e, hold conversations, and even tackle niche reasoning puzzles. Yet the lea=
p from clever autocomplete to a true professional colleague requires a rich=
er recipe. Scale alone can sharpen skills in isolation, but it doesn=E2=80=
=99t endow a system with the breadth and durability of human cognition.
A central bottleneck is context. Real-world work is messy and dynamic: prio=
rities shift, constraints collide, and new edge cases materialize mid-proje=
ct. Today=E2=80=99s models operate in tight windows of awareness; give them=
 a 200-page product brief or months-long sales cycle, and they lose the thr=
ead. =E2=80=9CMemory=E2=80=9D features exist, but they=E2=80=99re shallow n=
otes pasted into a prompt=E2=80=94not the adaptive, continuously updated wo=
rldview a teammate needs to do the job.
That weakness surfaces most clearly in tasks with multiple, partially confl=
icting rewards. Marketers, for example, juggle brand equity, short-term con=
versions, and long-term customer value, all while reacting to novelty in th=
e market. Optimizing one metric often cannibalizes another. Humans resolve =
that tension using tacit knowledge and intuition=E2=80=94signals we rarely =
articulate aloud because they=E2=80=99re politically sensitive or too fuzzy=
 to formalize. Those signals never make it into training data, so models re=
main blind to them.
Compounding the problem is data scarcity. High-quality training tokens=E2=
=80=94unedited prose, domain-specific logs, strategic back-and-forth=E2=80=
=94are rapidly becoming digital gold. Anthropic=E2=80=99s clamp-down on Win=
dsurf access after OpenAI=E2=80=99s acquisition underscores the arms race: =
whoever controls rich usage streams controls the next performance jump. But=
 even if every firm secured infinite tokens tomorrow, they would still conf=
ront the same missing capabilities: long-horizon intent, fast situational l=
earning, and genuine understanding of tacit cues.
Long-horizon intent is particularly stubborn. A competent colleague remembe=
rs why a project began, re-evaluates goals when conditions change, and push=
es back when a shortcut threatens the objective. Current models forget purp=
ose as soon as the prompt scrolls out of context, happily optimizing for sy=
ntactic completion rather than mission success. Without a breakthrough in g=
oal management=E2=80=94something more durable than a few user-supplied =E2=
=80=9Cprofile=E2=80=9D lines=E2=80=94agentic fantasies will stall.
Crucially, none of these gaps are inevitable outcomes of scale. They are se=
parate research frontiers=E2=80=94analogous to giving early computers netwo=
rking, graphics, and operating systems. Until the field publicly names and =
pursues them, venture capital will keep doubling down on compute budgets un=
der the false assumption that more neurons automatically equal more capabil=
ity.
That misallocation poses a strategic risk. If companies pour billions into =
bigger models without solving adaptation, memory, or tacit understanding, w=
e may land in a jagged future: staggering raw intelligence coexisting with =
brittle, under-delivering products. Users will grow cynical, regulators wil=
l tighten the screws, and the next wave of innovation could stagnate.
The remedy starts with vocabulary. Builders, buyers, and the public need cl=
ear language for the missing pieces: adaptable context, multi-reward reason=
ing, tacit-knowledge capture, long-horizon agency. Articulating the gaps sh=
apes research agendas, product roadmaps, and policy debates. It also empowe=
rs end-users to demand more than =E2=80=9CGPT-5 but bigger.=E2=80=9D If we =
can=E2=80=99t name what comes after scale, we shouldn=E2=80=99t be surprise=
d when scale alone stops moving the needle.
Context
Sam Altman=E2=80=99s wager on =E2=80=9Cagents that discover new knowledge=
=E2=80=9D highlights an unresolved asymmetry: discovery is not a single-sho=
t prompt, it=E2=80=99s an extended expedition through evolving evidence. To=
day=E2=80=99s LLMs can brute-force literature reviews or synthesize pattern=
s in code, but the moment the search space mutates=E2=80=94new papers drop,=
 cost constraints tighten, requirements shift=E2=80=94the agent=E2=80=99s w=
orking memory evaporates. It cannot keep its epistemic bearings the way a g=
raduate student can, continuously reconciling fresh signals with months-old=
 hypotheses. Until models can carry a stable, self-updating worldview acros=
s thousands of iterative steps, Altman=E2=80=99s discovery agent will resem=
ble a savant who forgets yesterday=E2=80=99s lab notes every night.
Jensen Huang=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CChatGPT moment for general robotics=E2=80=
=9D faces an even steeper context cliff. Physical environments are fluid: l=
ighting changes, sensors drift, objects appear in unmodeled locations, and =
goals evolve mid-shift. A robot that navigates a warehouse Tuesday might ne=
ed to adapt to a holiday layout Wednesday and a new safety rule Friday. Cur=
rent vision-language models recognize scenes in narrow vignettes, but they =
don=E2=80=99t accumulate spatial and procedural memory the way a seasoned w=
orker internalizes shortcuts, hazards, and unwritten norms. Without a mecha=
nism for lifelong, embodied learning, the next-gen robot will keep calling =
the human floor manager when the pallets move two feet left.
Demis Hassabis and Dario Amodei both anchor their AGI timelines on =E2=80=
=9Cbetter than almost all humans at almost all things,=E2=80=9D yet each =
=E2=80=9Cthing=E2=80=9D is embedded in a lattice of tacit politics and part=
ial rewards. Take enterprise sales: closing a deal is not just about produc=
t specs; it=E2=80=99s about reading power dynamics, sensing unvoiced object=
ions, remembering off-record tidbits from a dinner six months ago, and bala=
ncing short-term quota with long-term relationship equity. LLMs can draft f=
ollow-up emails that sound earnest, but they lack the situated memory of wh=
o actually pulls budget strings or which rumor might derail procurement. Sc=
aling parameters has not taught models to infer the negative space=E2=80=94=
the crucial facts nobody dares type into Slack.
Even Mustafa Suleyman=E2=80=99s forecast that =E2=80=9Cmost human knowledge=
 work=E2=80=9D will be AI-handled within a decade collides with context bri=
ttleness. Knowledge work thrives on exceptions: last-minute regulatory chan=
ges, surprise M&A chatter, a CEO=E2=80=99s off-script remark that reframes =
a project. Humans integrate those curveballs by weaving them into a tacit n=
arrative of =E2=80=9Cwhat we=E2=80=99re really trying to do here.=E2=80=9D =
Today=E2=80=99s agents still treat each interruption as a brand-new prompt =
rather than an update to an ongoing story. Unless architectures emerge that=
 treat memory, intent, and social inference as first-class citizens=E2=80=
=94not bolt-on prompt hacks=E2=80=94hype will keep outpacing reality, and t=
he steep part of the AGI mountain will remain unclimbed.
Long Horizon Intent
Long-horizon intent is the capacity to hold a goal steady across weeks or m=
onths of shifting sub-tasks, ambiguous feedback, and imperfect information.=
 Humans maintain that continuity by weaving a living narrative: we remember=
 why a project began, track how each day=E2=80=99s surprises alter the road=
map, and revise tactics while preserving purpose. Today=E2=80=99s language =
models, by contrast, treat every interaction as an isolated episode. Even w=
ith a =E2=80=9Cmemory=E2=80=9D file appended to the prompt, they lack an in=
ternal mechanism for goal persistence; the model does not know which facts =
are strategic anchors versus expendable details, so its focus drifts the mo=
ment the prompt omits a reminder.
Why does that matter? Consider a product-launch timeline that spans market =
research, prototype iterations, regulatory filings, and a coordinated GTM p=
ush six quarters out. Early decisions=E2=80=94say, tolerances set by the ha=
rdware team=E2=80=94ripple forward into compliance documentation and messag=
ing nuance. A competent manager keeps these dependencies top-of-mind; a cur=
rent-generation agent sees only the slice of context in its active prompt. =
Ask it to draft a regulatory brief two months later and it may reintroduce =
a previously rejected spec, oblivious to the earlier design review. Long-ho=
rizon intent is not mere recall; it is the ability to judge which archived =
decisions still constrain future moves and which can be safely discarded.
Research communities have explored analogs=E2=80=94hierarchical reinforceme=
nt learning, recurrent world-models, planning transformers=E2=80=94but none=
 has yet married that scaffolding with the broad linguistic competence of t=
oday=E2=80=99s LLMs. The technical challenge is twofold: (1) encoding inten=
t so it survives billions of inference steps without ballooning context cos=
ts, and (2) teaching the model to update that intent only when new evidence=
 warrants it, rather than oscillating wildly with each prompt. Fine-tuning =
on synthetic =E2=80=9Cjourney=E2=80=9D datasets helps a little, but without=
 an architecture that separates policy (the enduring objective) from workin=
g memory (the transient details), agents remain susceptible to reward misal=
ignment and objective drift.
Until those breakthroughs arrive, long-horizon tasks will continue to expos=
e LLM brittleness. Teams can scaffold around it=E2=80=94chunk work into mic=
ro-goals, checkpoint state in external planners=E2=80=94but that shifts com=
plexity onto human operators and erodes the promise of true autonomy. Put b=
luntly, scaling tokens and parameters will yield sharper reasoning in the m=
oment, yet without a native representation of enduring intent the model is =
still an amnesiac prodigy: brilliant in 30-second bursts, lost over a fisca=
l quarter. AGI is impossible without solving that continuity problem, becau=
se intelligence that forgets why it started can never finish the job.
Adaptable Learning and Memory
Adaptable learning=E2=80=94the ability to incorporate fresh experience on t=
he fly without retraining from scratch=E2=80=94is the beating heart of real=
 expertise, yet it remains elusive for today=E2=80=99s models. When a human=
 support rep handles a novel edge case, they don=E2=80=99t open a textbook;=
 they adjust their mental model, store the lesson, and recognize the patter=
n next time. By contrast, an LLM confronted with a policy change tomorrow h=
as no native mechanism to internalize that update persistently. At best you=
 can prepend the new rule to every prompt or rely on a post-hoc =E2=80=9Cme=
mory=E2=80=9D file, but that hack scales poorly: the more patches you add, =
the more brittle the prompt becomes, and the higher the likelihood the mode=
l will ignore or overwrite a critical detail.
True adaptability demands continual learning without catastrophic forgettin=
g=E2=80=94a research frontier still in its infancy. Techniques like elastic=
 weight consolidation, rehearsal buffers, and parameter-efficient adapters =
offer partial relief, yet they all struggle with long-tail, domain-specific=
 data that arrives in trickles rather than torrents. Enterprises want a mod=
el that digests yesterday=E2=80=99s compliance bulletin overnight and execu=
tes flawlessly this morning; current solutions either overfit that tiny upd=
ate or wash it away when the next mini-fine-tune arrives. Until models can =
balance stability and plasticity=E2=80=94rewiring a small subset of weights=
 while protecting core competencies=E2=80=94the dream of a self-updating AI=
 colleague stays out of reach.
Memory architecture is the other half of the puzzle. Today=E2=80=99s retrie=
val-augmented generation keeps terabytes of context just one vector search =
away (although whether the search is effective is a different story), but t=
he model doesn=E2=80=99t own that memory; it merely consults an external ca=
che at inference time. Ownership matters because many tasks hinge on meta-k=
nowledge: what do I already know, where did it come from, and how trustwort=
hy is it now? A sales engineer recalls not just the latest pricing sheet bu=
t the negotiation history that shaped it. To emulate that, models need hier=
archical, time-stamped memories they can query, weight, and even forget whe=
n the information becomes stale or harmful=E2=80=94essentially a built-in k=
nowledge management system, not a glorified autocomplete buffer.
Several labs are experimenting with neural knowledge graphs, fast weights, =
and episodic memory modules that store compressed representations of past i=
nteractions. Early prototypes show promise in toy environments=E2=80=94an a=
gent can remember that it already picked up the key before trying to unlock=
 the door=E2=80=94but scaling those mechanisms to enterprise complexity is =
uncharted territory. The challenge isn=E2=80=99t merely adding more storage=
; it=E2=80=99s teaching the model to reason over its own memories, deciding=
 which events are causal, which are noise, and when a new observation shoul=
d rewrite the old story. Until adaptable learning and true memory become fi=
rst-class citizens in model design, AI will keep dazzling in demos and stum=
bling in production, trapped in an eternal present with no reliable past to=
 build on.
Data scarcity
High-quality human text=E2=80=94the kind that encodes unstated norms, credi=
ble context, and hard-won domain knowledge=E2=80=94is no longer the bottoml=
ess well it appeared to be in 2022. Nearly every English web page of any su=
bstance has already been scraped, deduped, and folded into one frontier mod=
el or another. What remains on the open internet is increasingly derivative=
: SEO sludge, AI-authored filler, or gated behind paywalls and NDAs. Copyri=
ght lawsuits and regional data-sovereignty laws are closing other historica=
l troves, shrinking the pool of fresh, legally defensible tokens that can a=
ctually move the loss curve.
Model makers have responded by treating usage itself as the new gold seam. =
Every conversation in ChatGPT or Claude=E2=80=94especially when a human edi=
ts, corrects, or thumbs-up a reply=E2=80=94generates =E2=80=9Clearning toke=
ns=E2=80=9D rich with real-time feedback. OpenAI=E2=80=99s acquisition of W=
indsurf, a vendor that pipes customer service chat logs directly into fine-=
tuning loops, revealed just how valuable those feedback-laden streams have =
become. Anthropic=E2=80=99s immediate decision to cut Windsurf=E2=80=99s fi=
rst-party access wasn=E2=80=99t mere spite; it was a defensive play to keep=
 its own user-reward tokens from feeding a rival=E2=80=99s model. In this r=
egime, the most defensible moat isn=E2=80=99t algorithmic=E2=80=94it=E2=80=
=99s a proprietary faucet of human-curated data that updates every hour.
Synthetic text offers a tempting workaround: spin up a swarm of smaller mod=
els to generate billions of fresh sentences, then train a larger model on t=
hat output. But synthetic corpora seems to be helpful in some contexts but =
not others. Reward loops also get trickier as data needs for big models get=
 larger and larger. Fully automated synthetic pipelines risk a hall-of-mirr=
ors effect where models chase coherence over truth, reinforcing tropes rath=
er than discovering nuance.
The upshot is a bifurcated future. Firms that control continuous streams of=
 human-rewarded tokens=E2=80=94messaging platforms, customer-support vendor=
s, collaborative coding clouds=E2=80=94will keep inching forward on quality=
 while rivals plateau on stale web dumps. Everyone else must get creative: =
partnering with enterprises for anonymized logs, paying subject-matter expe=
rts to generate high-signal micro-datasets, or inventing architectures that=
 learn more from less. Until someone cracks genuinely data-efficient learni=
ng, the scarcity of fresh, richly annotated human discourse will be the sil=
ent throttle on the grand AGI timeline=E2=80=94no matter how many GPUs we a=
dd.
Where the Path Actually Leads
Stepping back, the through-line is stark: bigger models and cheaper GPUs gi=
ve us sharper tricks, but it=E2=80=99s not clear that scaling them 10x or 1=
00x more will by definition grant the durable agency that makes a colleague=
 indispensable. Context brittleness, short-range intent, brittle memory, an=
d a drying well of high-signal data form a quartet of bottlenecks that no a=
mount of parameter stuffing can dodge. Each hype quote=E2=80=94from Altman=
=E2=80=99s discovery agents to Suleyman=E2=80=99s knowledge-work takeover=
=E2=80=94rests on breakthroughs that (at least) hasn=E2=80=99t been release=
d to the public yet and which we should presume has not been fully solved: =
continual learning that won=E2=80=99t destabilize, memory that can forget a=
s wisely as it recalls, and a supply chain for fresh, human-rewarded tokens=
 that isn=E2=80=99t siphoned by competitors or lawsuits.
That reality doesn=E2=80=99t spell doom; it just reframes the roadmap. The =
next leaps will come from architectures that treat memory, intent, and adap=
tability as first-class primitives, not prompt-engineering afterthoughts. T=
hey=E2=80=99ll come from inventive data deals, human-in-the-loop pipelines,=
 and research that prizes data efficiency over raw scale. In other words, p=
rogress up ahead may look less like an exponential curve and more like a se=
t of new jagged axes=E2=80=94each demanding its own set of inventions=E2=80=
=94a multidimensional path to AGI with some bumps along the way. Acknowledg=
ing that jagged terrain is the first step toward climbing it, and the sures=
t hedge against being stranded halfway up the mountain when the linear path=
 finally hits bedrock.

he now gives less than 50 percent odds that today=E2=80=99s systems can rep=

 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

sively by two levers: ever-larger pre-training corpora and increasingly sop=
histicated inference techniques. Those gains feel spectacular=E2=80=94model=
s write code, hold conversations, and even tackle niche reasoning puzzles. =
Yet the leap from clever autocomplete to a true professional colleague requ=
ires a richer recipe. Scale alone can sharpen skills in isolation, but it d=
oesn=E2=80=99t endow a system with the breadth and durability of human cogn=
ition.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">A central bottleneck is context. Real-world work is =
messy and dynamic: priorities shift, constraints collide, and new edge case=
s materialize mid-project. Today=E2=80=99s models operate in tight windows =
of awareness; give them a 200-page product brief or months-long sales cycle=
, and they lose the thread. =E2=80=9CMemory=E2=80=9D features exist, but th=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

conflicting rewards. Marketers, for example, juggle brand equity, short-ter=
m conversions, and long-term customer value, all while reacting to novelty =
in the market. Optimizing one metric often cannibalizes another. Humans res=
olve that tension using tacit knowledge and intuition=E2=80=94signals we ra=

in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Lon=
g-horizon intent is particularly stubborn. A competent colleague remembers =
why a project began, re-evaluates goals when conditions change, and pushes =
back when a shortcut threatens the objective. Current models forget purpose=
 as soon as the prompt scrolls out of context, happily optimizing for synta=
ctic completion rather than mission success. Without a breakthrough in goal=
 management=E2=80=94something more durable than a few user-supplied =E2=80=

re separate research frontiers=E2=80=94analogous to giving early computers =
networking, graphics, and operating systems. Until the field publicly names=
 and pursues them, venture capital will keep doubling down on compute budge=

 or tacit understanding, we may land in a jagged future: staggering raw int=
