Everyone's building individual AI agents. Almost nobody's figured out how t=
o make them work together.=20
And it=E2=80=99s hard to get your agents to work as a team when we can=E2=
=80=99t agree on what we even mean by AI agents! The truth is nobody has fi=
gured out how to talk coherently about how many different types and classes=
 of AI agents are out there=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99re all swimming in an ocean =
of AI agent hype, but practical guides are thin on the ground.
I've been writing about AI agents [ https://substack.com/redirect/26cc03a7-=
ffad-4ab0-ab22-075fd89d5fdc?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for months now. Yesterday I shared my deep dive into=
 n8n [ https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/the-complete-guide-t=
o-building-ai?r=3D1z4sm5&utm_campaign=3Dpost&utm_medium=3Dweb&showWelcomeOn=
Share=3Dfalse ]=E2=80=94showing you how to build workflow agents, connect A=
PIs, handle errors, all the practical stuff. That guide ran 20,000+ words b=
ecause I wanted to document everything: what actually works, what breaks, w=
hat's worth your time. That whole n8n guide was focused on the problem of b=
uilding really good individual agents.=20
This guide goes to the next level.
Because even when you get good at building individual agents, orchestrating=
 multiple agents to work together is a different beast entirely. You end up=
 manually copying outputs from one system to another, trying to coordinate =
work that should be coordinated automatically.
That's where Manus comes in. And I need to explain what Manus actually is, =
because I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s been properly classified.=20
Manus is not an agent. It is not a collection of agents (as often reported)=
=2E No. Manus is an autonomous AI agent=
 platform. Not a chatbot, not a workfl=
ow builder=E2=80=94it's a system that can plan and execute complete project=
s with minimal supervision. You give it a high-level goal like "analyze my =
competitors and create a report" and it breaks that down into steps, execut=
es them using specialized sub-agents, and delivers finished work.
The difference matters. With ChatGPT, you're having a conversation. With n8=
n, you're building the exact workflow. With Manus, you're describing an out=
come and letting it figure out the path. It's not better or worse=E2=80=94i=
t's a different layer of the stack.
And I=E2=80=99ve chosen Manus because in many ways it is the easiest path i=
nto multi-agent orchestration=E2=80=94and all the productivity unlocks that=
 you get with multiple agents working the same problem.=20
So why now? Manus launched in March after all.
Well the truth is Manus wasn=E2=80=99t mature enough for a guide like this =
in March.
That=E2=80=99s why I'm writing about this now: Manus is finally through the=
 teething problems associated with launch in the spring. I think it=E2=80=
=99s worth paying attention to now as the product has matured, and I want y=
ou to have the resources to use it properly.=20
With that in mind, I've assembled what's probably the most comprehensive co=
llection of Manus resources available anywhere. And that=E2=80=99s not all!=
 I think part of the issue with Manus is that understanding and classifying=
 agents is hard, so I=E2=80=99ve assembled a framework for understanding au=
tonomous agents=E2=80=94not just Manus, but the whole category=E2=80=94need=
s to be spelled out clearly. We need shared language for talking about what=
 these systems can and can't do.
Here's what's in the box with this article:
The 178-page Manus AI Handbook - This is the real technical documentation. =
How the three-layer architecture works (planning, execution, validation). W=
hat it can actually do (web browsing, code generation, data analysis, API c=
alls, deployment). What it struggles with (perfect accuracy, deep expertise=
, real-time tasks). Actual case studies with numbers. If you wanted to unde=
rstand Manus deeply, this is what you'd need.
My Substack article - I've walked through specific Manus examples with my t=
esting notes. Where it shines (complex multi-step projects), where it falls=
 apart (tasks needing specialized knowledge), and when you should use it ve=
rsus other approaches.
Two live dashboards Manus built - Not mockups. Manus actually built these i=
tself:
A SaaS metrics dashboard with synthetic data - Manus worked hard on this on=
e, generating realistic sample data and building the full visualization lay=
er
An AI agents explorer showing the MACE (Multi-Agent Collaboration Engine) c=
oncept I introduce in the Substack. These demonstrate that Manus builds sim=
ple, fully functional applications, not just text outputs. You can click ar=
ound, interact with them, see how they work.
Manus's guide to itself - I asked Manus to document its own capabilities. I=
t's surprisingly honest about its limitations. Worth reading to understand =
how these systems see themselves.
Why naming the framework matters (and it=E2=80=99s not boring):
We're terrible at talking about AI agents. People say "AI agent" and might =
mean a chatbot, a workflow automation, a research assistant, or an autonomo=
us system. That confusion is holding us back.
The framework I'm documenting distinguishes between:
Workflow agents (like what you build in n8n - defined steps, deterministic =
execution)
Conversational agents (like ChatGPT - respond to prompts, maintain context)
Autonomous agents (like Manus - plan and execute projects independently)
This isn't academic navel-gazing. It's practical. When someone says they wa=
nt an "AI agent," you need to know which type they actually need. Most busi=
nesses need workflow agents. Some need conversational agents for customers.=
 And yes, most probably need autonomous agents, but they don=E2=80=99t know=
 how to specify that request and usually get it mixed up with workflow agen=
ts! My goal is to take the spaghetti bowl of AI agents and untangle those t=
hreads a bit so we all get less confused.
Why Manus specifically is worth a hefty guide:
Three reasons:
First, it's accessible. $39-199/month versus $50,000+ for custom developmen=
t. That democratizes capability that was previously enterprise-only.
Second, as of the last month or two it actually works. Marketing agencies a=
re getting 3x content output. Financial firms are compressing analysis from=
 days to hours. These are real numbers from real implementations, not demos=
=2E
Third, it shows us where this is all heading. Manus isn't perfect=E2=80=94i=
t still sometimes hallucinates, gets stuck in loops, makes confident mistak=
es. But it's now good enough to be useful for real work today. And understa=
nding its patterns helps you prepare for what's coming in fall of 2025.
The practical reality:
Here's what using Manus actually looks like. You give it a task: "Create a =
competitive analysis for [company]." It breaks that down: research competit=
ors, analyze features, compare pricing, identify gaps, create report. It sp=
ins up different agents for each part, coordinates their work, combines out=
puts, and delivers a document.
Is it perfect? No. You'll need to review and edit. But it turns a week-long=
 project into a few hours of work. That's the trade-off.
If you've built agents with n8n, think of Manus as the orchestration layer =
above your workflows. Your n8n agents handle specific, well-defined tasks. =
Manus figures out which tasks need doing and coordinates them.
If you're new to all this, these resources give you the complete picture: w=
hat's actually possible today, what's still hype, and how to tell the diffe=

Why Manus AI Matters (Even If You'll Never Use It)

unched in March 2025 and I didn't talk about it. The hype video ran way ahe=
ad of what people could actually do with it=E2=80=94another Devon situation=
=2E Reddit forums filled with complaint=
s. Twitter erupted. Through June, the=20=
platform struggled with reliability issues, cost opacity, and token consump=
tion that made no sense.
That's starting to shift. The platform is stabilizing enough that we need t=
o have a wider conversation. Not just about Manus, but about what it repres=
ents: the first serious attempt at multi-agent orchestration available to r=
egular developers. It's showing us both the promise and the genuine enginee=
ring challenges of autonomous AI execution.
But before we dive into why Manus matters, we need to talk about a more fun=
damental problem that's been plaguing the AI space: we can't even name thes=
e things properly.
The Naming Problem That's Breaking Enterprise AI
AI is a slippery technology. It's general purpose, it can do anything, and =
that makes categorizing different AI tools almost impossible. Yet naming an=
d categorizing is critical for getting work done.
When someone says "AI agent," what do they mean? Claude Code writes code bu=
t doesn't just code. Manus writes code too, but also runs it and continues =
the workflow. ChatGPT has "agent mode" but it's not remotely the same thing=
 as what Manus does. We keep using the same words for fundamentally differe=
nt capabilities.
This isn't academic nitpicking. Organizations need predictability to make p=
urchasing decisions. They need to know what they're buying and when to use =
it. The current naming chaos makes that impossible.
Here's a concrete example: A startup founder asks, "Should I use Claude Cod=
e or Manus for building my MVP?" Without a framework, you can't answer. Bot=
h "write code." Both are "AI agents." But one writes code for you to review=
 and run, while the other autonomously builds, deploys, and iterates. They'=
re as different as a text editor and a software factory, but we call them b=
oth "coding agents."
This confusion costs real money. Companies buy the wrong tools. Teams spend=
 weeks trying to make a conversational AI do autonomous execution. Consulta=
nts recommend workflow orchestrators for tasks that need adaptive reasoning=
=2E We need a better way to think about these tools.
The MACE Framework: A Taxonomy That Actually Helps
I'm proposing a framework for assessing agentic AI tools=E2=80=94one that a=
ctually helps you make decisions. Call it MACE: Modality, Autonomy, Complex=
ity, and Environment. These four dimensions capture what actually matters w=
hen evaluating AI agents.
Modality: What Can This Tool Manipulate?
Modality determines what kinds of problems the tool can even attempt. It's =
not just about input and output=E2=80=94it's about what the tool can manipu=
late and transform.
Text agents like Claude and ChatGPT work with language. They can analyze, g=
enerate, and transform text, but they can't execute code or interact with e=
xternal systems. If your problem is "write a report," they're perfect. If y=
our problem is "analyze this database and create a dashboard," they literal=
ly can't do it.
Code agents like Cursor and GitHub Copilot understand programming languages=
 and can generate syntactically correct code, but they operate within your =
development environment. They assume you'll run the code, handle errors, an=
d manage deployment. They're collaborators, not executors.
Workflow agents like n8n and Zapier connect predefined systems through APIs=
 and webhooks. They excel at predictable, repetitive tasks but can't handle=
 ambiguity. They'll reliably move data from A to B, but ask them to "figure=
 out what's important in this data" and they're lost.
Research agents like Perplexity access and synthesize information from mult=
iple sources. They can search, read, and summarize, but they can't act on w=
hat they find. Great for answering "what's the market size for X?" Useless =
for "build me a market analysis dashboard."
Multimodal agents like Manus combine capabilities: text, code, web browsing=
, file manipulation. This isn't just convenience=E2=80=94it enables entirel=
y different workflows. Manus can research a topic, write code to analyze da=
ta about it, create visualizations, and compile everything into a report. T=
hat's not four separate tasks; it's one integrated workflow that requires m=
ultiple modalities working together.
Understanding modality tells you immediately what's possible and what's not=
=2E It's the difference between hiring=20=
a writer, a programmer, a data entry c=
lerk, or a full-service consultancy.
Autonomy: How Much Supervision Does This Need?
Autonomy determines how much of your time the tool saves versus how much it=
 assists. This isn't about capability=E2=80=94it's about independence.
Reactive agents respond to individual prompts. You ask, they answer, they s=
top. Every step requires your initiation. ChatGPT and Claude in their basic=
 chat interfaces are reactive. They're powerful but need constant direction=
=2E
Interactive agents engage in multi-turn dialogue, maintaining context and a=
sking clarifying questions. Deep Research when it comes back with "Should I=
 focus on academic sources or industry reports?" is being interactive. It's=
 a conversation, not just Q&A.
Semi-autonomous agents execute multi-step plans but pause at checkpoints fo=
r approval. GitHub Copilot Workspace shows you its plan, lets you modify it=
, then proceeds. It's doing real work but keeping you in the loop at critic=
al moments.
Fully autonomous agents take a goal and run with it until completion. Manus=
 and Devin operate here. You say "build me a dashboard analyzing last quart=
er's sales" and come back to a finished product. The time savings are massi=
ve, but so is the trust required.
Here's why this matters: If you have 10 hours of work and 1 hour of attenti=
on, you need full autonomy. If you have 2 hours of work and 2 hours of atte=
ntion, reactive might be better=E2=80=94you maintain control and quality. A=
utonomy isn't always better; it's about matching the tool to your availabil=
ity and risk tolerance.
Complexity: What Kinds of Problems Can This Solve?
Complexity handling separates toys from tools. It's not about how hard the =
tool works, but how sophisticated its problem-solving approach is.
Simple task handlers do one thing at a time, linearly. Ask ChatGPT to "summ=
arize this article" and it reads and summarizes. No branching logic, no err=
or recovery, no adaptation.
Sequential processors handle multi-step tasks but only in a predetermined o=
rder. Claude with Artifacts can write code, then documentation, then tests=
=E2=80=94but only in that sequence. If step 2 fails, it can't skip to step =
3 and come back.
Branching navigators handle conditional logic and different paths. n8n work=
flows can check if a file exists, and if yes, process it; if no, send an al=
ert. They handle "if-then-else" but the branches are predefined.
Adaptive replanners modify their approach based on results. Manus might pla=
n to scrape a website, discover it requires login, pivot to using an API in=
stead, find the API is rate-limited, then implement caching=E2=80=94all wit=
hout asking you. It's not just following branches; it's creating new paths =
when needed.
This dimension explains why your n8n workflow breaks when a website changes=
 its layout (it can't adapt), why ChatGPT gives up when a multi-step math p=
roblem gets complex (it can't replan), and why Manus sometimes takes unexpe=
cted approaches to problems (it's adapting on the fly).
Environment: Where Does This Tool Operate?
Environment determines what systems the tool can touch and how it integrate=
s with your existing infrastructure.
Cloud-contained tools run entirely in the provider's sandbox. ChatGPT and C=
laude operate here=E2=80=94they can't touch your files, can't access your s=
ystems, can't break anything. Safe but limited.
IDE-integrated tools work within your development environment. Cursor has a=
ccess to your codebase, can modify files, and use your local tools. More po=
werful but requires you to manage execution and deployment.
Platform-hosted tools run on dedicated infrastructure with controlled acces=
s to external systems. n8n can connect to your database, your APIs, your cl=
oud services=E2=80=94but only through predefined connectors and with your e=
xplicit configuration.
Infrastructure-spanning tools can deploy to and control multiple external s=
ystems autonomously. Manus can spin up servers, deploy code, modify databas=
es, and scrape websites=E2=80=94it operates across boundaries. Maximum capa=
bility, maximum risk.
This dimension explains why you can't use ChatGPT to update your CRM (it's =
cloud-contained), why Cursor can't deploy your code to production (it's IDE=
-limited), and why Manus costs so much (infrastructure-spanning requires co=
mplex orchestration).
Why These Dimensions Matter Together
Here's the crucial insight: these dimensions interact to create capabilitie=
s and limitations.
A tool might be multimodal but reactive (Claude can analyze images and writ=
e code, but only when prompted). Another might be autonomous but single-mod=
al (a web scraper that runs continuously but only scrapes). The combination=
s determine what's actually possible.
When someone asks, "What AI should I use for X?", you now have a framework:
What modalities does X require?
How much autonomy do I want/need?
How complex is the problem-solving required?
What environment must the tool operate in?
This framework reveals why certain tools cluster into natural categories=E2=
=80=94and why those categories matter for your actual decisions.
Six Practical Categories That Emerge from MACE
When you apply the MACE framework to existing tools, six distinct categorie=
s emerge. These aren't arbitrary=E2=80=94they represent genuine differences=
 in capability and use case.
1. Conversational Generators
MACE Profile: Text modality, reactive autonomy, simple to sequential comple=
xity, cloud-contained environment
ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini dominate here. They excel at any task that can =
be completed with text generation and human oversight. Writing, analysis, i=
deation, explanation=E2=80=94if the output is words and you're there to gui=
de it, these tools are unmatched.
But their limitations are equally clear. They can't execute code, can't acc=
ess your systems, can't even remember what you said last week without speci=
al configuration. When you need action rather than words, or when you need =
true automation, they hit a wall.
When to use: You need high-quality text/analysis and you're actively engage=
d. When to avoid: You need execution, integration, or hands-off operation.
2. Code Assistants
MACE Profile: Code modality, reactive to interactive autonomy, sequential c=
omplexity, IDE-integrated environment
Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code understand code deeply. They know s=
yntax, patterns, best practices. They can see your entire codebase and sugg=
est contextually appropriate solutions. They turn programming from typing t=
o editing.
But they assume you're in control. They write code; you run it. They sugges=
t fixes; you implement them. They can't deploy, can't test in production, c=
an't handle the full software lifecycle. They're powerful collaborators tha=
t still need a human driver.
When to use: You're actively programming and want acceleration, not automat=
ion. When to avoid: You need end-to-end execution or non-code tasks.
3. Workflow Orchestrators
MACE Profile: Workflow modality, semi-autonomous, branching complexity, pla=
tform-hosted environment
n8n, Zapier, and Make excel at connecting systems with predictable patterns=
=2E Set up once, run forever. They hand=
le the boring, repetitive tasks that c=
omputers should have been doing all along. When data needs to flow from A t=
o B to C on a schedule or trigger, they're perfect.
But they're rigid. They do exactly what you configured, nothing more or les=
s. When a website changes its layout, when an API returns unexpected data, =
when the task requires judgment=E2=80=94they fail. They're automation, not =
intelligence.
When to use: Predictable, repetitive tasks between known systems. When to a=
void: Tasks requiring adaptation, judgment, or natural language understandi=
ng.
4. Research Synthesizers
MACE Profile: Research modality, interactive autonomy, sequential to branch=
ing complexity, cloud-contained with web access
Perplexity, Deep Research, and Claude Code with web search find and synthes=
ize information brilliantly. They turn the chaos of the internet into coher=
ent answers. They cite sources, compare perspectives, and identify patterns=
 across documents.
But they stop at synthesis. They can tell you about market opportunities bu=
t can't build the business plan. They can research competitors but can't cr=
eate the comparison dashboard. They're investigators, not implementers.
When to use: You need current information compiled and analyzed. When to av=
oid: You need to act on findings or create deliverables beyond text.
5. Autonomous Executors
MACE Profile: Multimodal, fully autonomous, adaptive complexity, infrastruc=
ture-spanning environment
Manus and Devin represent the frontier. They combine research, coding, exec=
ution, and iteration into complete workflows. They don't just plan; they do=
=2E They don't just attempt; they retry and adapt until successful.
But this power comes with unpredictability and cost. They might take unexpe=
cted approaches. They might consume 10x the resources you expected. They mi=
ght produce something that works but isn't what you envisioned. They're lik=
e brilliant but expensive consultants who interpret requirements creatively=
=2E
When to use: Complex multi-step projects where speed matters more than perf=
ect control. When to avoid: Simple tasks, tight budgets, or situations wher=
e mistakes are costly.
6. Hybrid Collaborators
MACE Profile: Mixed modality, interactive to semi-autonomous, branching to =
adaptive complexity, varied environment
Claude Projects, ChatGPT Canvas, and Cursor Composer blend AI capability wi=
th human judgment. They maintain context across sessions, learn your prefer=
ences, and can handle complex tasks while keeping you involved at key decis=
ion points.
These tools recognize that full automation isn't always the goal. Sometimes=
 you want AI to handle the grunt work while you make the creative decisions=
=2E They're partners, not replacements.
When to use: Iterative creative work requiring both AI capability and human=
 judgment. When to avoid: You need full automation or simple one-shot tasks=
=2E
The Pattern You Should Notice
These categories aren't random. They represent different philosophies about=
 human-AI collaboration:
Generators augment human creativity
Assistants accelerate human productivity
Orchestrators eliminate human repetition
Synthesizers extend human knowledge
Executors replace human labor
Collaborators blend human judgment with AI capability
Understanding these categories helps you match tools to needs. But even wit=
h perfect categorization, some tools are harder to build than others. This =
brings us to Manus and why it matters.
The Engineering Reality: Why Multi-Agent Orchestration Is Actually Hard
Now that we understand what Manus is trying to be=E2=80=94a fully autonomou=
s, multimodal, adaptive, infrastructure-spanning executor=E2=80=94we can ap=
preciate why it's struggling. The engineering challenges aren't bugs; they'=
re fundamental problems that every company attempting this will face.
The State Management Nightmare
Imagine you're conducting an orchestra where each musician speaks a differe=
nt language, reads different notation, and plays at different speeds. That'=
s multi-agent orchestration.
Each sub-agent maintains its own state. The web scraper tracks what pages i=
t's visited. The code executor maintains variables and dependencies. The te=
xt generator holds context from previous outputs. The orchestrator must mai=
ntain coherence across all of these while they operate asynchronously.
When the web scraper fails on step 3, it doesn't just affect step 3. The co=
de executor might be waiting for that data. The report generator might have=
 already written a section assuming that data would exist. State corruption=
 cascades. Manus has to detect these cascades, roll back affected agents, a=
nd replan=E2=80=94all without losing critical information or getting stuck =
in loops.
This is why Manus sometimes seems to "forget" what it was doing or restart =
tasks unnecessarily. It's not forgetfulness; it's state recovery after casc=
ade failures.
The Context Window Cliff
LLMs have context windows=E2=80=94the amount of text they can consider at o=
nce. Even Claude's 200k token window fills up fast when you're juggling mul=
tiple agents.
Consider a typical Manus workflow: The plan (2k tokens), web scraping resul=
ts (10k tokens), code and execution logs (5k tokens), error messages and re=
tries (3k tokens), intermediate outputs (5k tokens). You're at 25k tokens a=
nd that's just one task. Each agent needs relevant context but not all cont=
ext. The code agent doesn't need the full web scraping results, just the st=
ructured data. The text generator needs the insights, not the raw code.
Manus implements selective context passing and summarization, but this intr=
oduces its own problems. Compress too much and you lose critical details. I=
nclude too much and you hit limits or burn tokens unnecessarily. This is wh=
y Manus's credit consumption seems unpredictable=E2=80=94context management=
 strategies change based on task complexity.
The Error Cascade Problem
In a single-agent system, errors are contained. In multi-agent systems, the=
y cascade and compound.
The web agent fails to scrape required data. The code agent receives incomp=
lete input and produces incorrect analysis. The visualization agent creates=
 misleading charts from bad analysis. The report generator writes conclusio=
ns based on flawed visualizations. Each agent did its job correctly given i=
ts input, but the final output is wrong.
Manus needs sophisticated error detection and recovery. It must distinguish=
 between "this agent failed" and "this agent succeeded but with garbage inp=
ut." It needs rollback strategies, checkpoint systems, and validation layer=
s. Sometimes it gets stuck in retry loops because it can't determine whethe=
r the error is recoverable or fundamental.
The Resource Prediction Impossibility
When you ask Manus to "analyze this market and create a report," how many c=
redits will it use? Nobody knows=E2=80=94not even Manus.
If the market data is readily available, it might take 50 credits. If sourc=
es are fragmented, it might need 200 credits for extensive searching. If in=
itial approaches fail, adaptation might cost 500 credits. If the code hits =
edge cases requiring debugging, add another 200. The same request could cos=
t 50 or 1000 credits depending on execution path.
This isn't poor design; it's fundamental uncertainty. Adaptive systems can'=
t predict their resource usage because they don't know what adaptations the=
y'll need. It's like asking a consultant to quote a fixed price before they=
 know what problems they'll discover.
The Quality Assurance Paradox
How do you validate output from a system you didn't explicitly program?
Traditional software has deterministic outputs you can test. Multi-agent sy=
stems have emergent outputs you can only evaluate. When Manus produces a da=
shboard, is it correct? The data might be accurately scraped, properly proc=
essed, and beautifully visualized=E2=80=94but still miss the point of what =
you wanted.
Manus uses LLMs to validate its own output, but this is like asking someone=
 to grade their own homework. LLMs are notoriously bad at checking math, ca=
n't reliably verify code correctness, and might not understand domain-speci=
fic requirements. Human review is essential, but that defeats the promise o=
f automation.
Why These Challenges Matter for Users
Understanding these engineering challenges isn't academic=E2=80=94it direct=
ly explains Manus's behavior and limitations:
Why credits burn unpredictably: Adaptive replanning and context management =
vary by task
Why simple tasks sometimes fail: Error cascades from unexpected agent inter=
actions
Why outputs sometimes miss the mark: Emergent behavior from multi-agent coo=
rdination
Why it's expensive: Redundancy and validation layers to prevent catastrophi=
c failures
Why it sometimes gets stuck: State recovery and error handling conflicts
This brings us to Manus's current position and the choice they've made.
Manus's Strategic Trilemma
Here's the fundamental engineering trilemma: you can optimize for two of th=
ree things=E2=80=94reliability, capability, or cost. You can't have all thr=
ee.
Manus chose reliability and capability over cost. They'd rather burn extra =
credits ensuring correctness than deliver fast-but-broken outputs. They'd r=
ather support complex workflows than constrain to simple ones. This explain=
s everything about their current state.
They're following the classic platform evolution pattern:
Demo Phase (March 2025): Show impressive capabilities under controlled cond=
itions. Generate excitement and investment.
Early Access (April-June 2025): Real users find edge cases. Reliability iss=
ues emerge. Community complaints peak. This is where most AI tools die.
Stabilization (July-September 2025): Fix the 80% of problems that affect 80=
% of users. Good enough for practical use in specific scenarios.
Optimization (Q4 2025 and beyond): Address cost and speed without breaking =
reliability. Expand use cases. Move upmarket to enterprise.
Manus is in late stabilization. The platform works reliably enough for real=
 use cases. The cost, while high, is predictable enough for budgeting. The =
quality, while imperfect, is good enough for first drafts.
But users want ChatGPT simplicity with autonomous execution and predictable=
 costs. Reality delivers complex workflows with autonomous execution and va=
riable costs. This fundamental tension explains why Manus remains an expens=
ive specialist tool rather than a mainstream app.
Five Sweet Spots Where Manus Actually Makes Sense Today
Despite the challenges, there are specific use cases where Manus delivers c=
lear value in September 2025. These aren't random=E2=80=94they share specif=
ic characteristics that align with Manus's strengths while avoiding its wea=
knesses.
1. High-Value Research & Analysis Reports
The Task: Monthly competitive intelligence briefings. Quarterly industry an=
alyses. Due diligence research packages. Market opportunity assessments.
Why Manus Wins: The economics are compelling=E2=80=94$100 in Manus credits =
versus $2,000+ for a consultant. It combines web research, data analysis, a=
nd formatted output in one workflow. Human review is expected anyway for st=
rategic decisions. Time savings are massive: two days of work becomes two h=
ours.
Real Example: "Analyze the competitive landscape for AI coding tools, inclu=
ding market positioning, pricing strategies, recent funding, and create an =
executive briefing with recommendations for our product strategy."
Manus will research each competitor, analyze their offerings, create compar=
ison matrices, and deliver a formatted report. The output won't be perfect,=
 but it's an excellent foundation that would have taken days to compile man=
ually.
2. Content Marketing Production Pipelines
The Task: Blog posts backed by research. Whitepapers with data analysis. Ca=
se studies with visualizations. Marketing reports that combine multiple sou=

Why Manus Wins: It scales content production without linear cost increases.=
 One Manus workflow can research, analyze, write, and format=E2=80=94tasks =
that would normally require multiple specialists. The quality bar is "good =
first draft," which is exactly what content teams need.
Real Example: "Research current trends in supply chain automation, identify=
 5 key challenges businesses face, analyze available solutions, and create =
a 2,000-word blog post with data visualizations and actionable recommendati=
ons."
Manus handles the entire pipeline: research =E2=86=92 analysis =E2=86=92 wr=
iting =E2=86=92 visualization =E2=86=92 formatting. A content team can then=
 polish and publish.
3. Data Analysis & Visualization for Non-Technical Teams
The Task: Sales dashboard creation. Marketing campaign analysis. Operations=
 reporting. Ad-hoc business intelligence requests.
Why Manus Wins: It eliminates the need to learn Python or hire a data scien=
tist. Upload a CSV, describe what you want to understand, and get back anal=
yzed data with visualizations. It handles the entire pipeline: cleaning =E2=
=86=92 analysis =E2=86=92 visualization =E2=86=92 interpretation.
Real Example: "Analyze this sales CSV, identify seasonal trends and top-per=
forming products by region, create visualizations showing patterns, and bui=
ld an interactive dashboard with recommendations for Q4 planning."
Manus writes the analysis code, creates the charts, and deploys a dashboard=
=E2=80=94tasks that would require technical skills most business teams lack=
=2E
4. Process Documentation & Automation Discovery
The Task: Documenting existing workflows. Identifying automation opportunit=
ies. Creating training materials. Process optimization analysis.
Why Manus Wins: It can observe processes, identify patterns, document steps=
, and recommend improvements=E2=80=94all in one workflow. It cross-referenc=
es multiple sources (documents, screenshots, descriptions) to create compre=
hensive documentation.
Real Example: "Review our customer onboarding process using these support t=
ickets, workflow diagrams, and system screenshots. Create comprehensive pro=
cess documentation and identify 3 automation opportunities with implementat=
ion recommendations."
Manus produces both the current-state documentation and future-state recomm=
endations, saving weeks of consultant time.
5. Technical Proof-of-Concept Development
The Task: MVP validation. Integration testing. Technical feasibility studie=
s. Prototype development for demos.
Why Manus Wins: Speed matters more than production quality. Manus can build=
 a working prototype, create documentation, and even deploy it for testing=
=E2=80=94all autonomously. Perfect for proving concepts before committing e=
ngineering resources.
Real Example: "Build a working prototype that pulls data from our CRM API, =
analyzes customer churn patterns, displays results in a web dashboard, and =
includes technical documentation for our development team."
Manus delivers a functional proof-of-concept that demonstrates feasibility =
and provides a blueprint for production development.
The Success Pattern: When Autonomous Execution Makes Sense
Look across these use cases and you'll see clear patterns:
Economic Justification:
Manual task value: $500-5,000
Manus cost: $50-200 in credits
ROI: 10-50x cost savings
Task Characteristics:
5-15 distinct steps across multiple domains
Clear deliverable with defined success criteria
Human review expected and budgeted
First draft quality acceptable
User Profile:
Technical comfort to review and refine AI output
Budget authority for $39-199/month tool cost
Time pressure making speed valuable
Quality standards professional but not mission-critical
This is the sweet spot for autonomous agents in fall 2025. Complex enough t=
o justify the cost, valuable enough to tolerate imperfection, clear enough =
to execute autonomously.
What Not to Use Manus For (Yet)
Understanding where Manus fails is just as important:
Simple Single-Step Tasks: Use ChatGPT or Claude instead. Manus is overkill =
for "summarize this article" or "write an email."
Mission-Critical Outputs: Legal documents, medical analysis, financial repo=
rting=E2=80=94anywhere errors have serious consequences. Manus isn't reliab=
le enough.
Real-Time Decision Making: Customer service, trading, live operations. Manu=
s is built for batch processing, not real-time response.
Large-Scale Batch Processing: Processing thousands of documents or running =
daily reports for hundreds of clients. Credits costs become astronomical.
Highly Regulated Processes: Compliance, auditing, or anywhere you need perf=
ect reproducibility. Manus's adaptive nature makes it non-deterministic.
Why Manus Is the Canary in the Coal Mine
Manus matters even if you never use it because it's showing us where the in=
dustry is going. They're the first to attempt true multi-agent orchestratio=
n at scale. They're exposing the genuine engineering challenges. They're pr=
oving there's real value despite the difficulties.
The major model makers are watching. We'll see versions of Manus from Googl=
e, Anthropic, or OpenAI within months. They have advantages Manus lacks:
Vertical integration: They control the models and infrastructure
Scale economies: They can amortize costs across millions of users
Data advantages: They see patterns across diverse use cases
Capital: They can absorb losses while solving engineering challenges
But Manus has first-mover advantage in understanding the actual problems. T=
hey've learned what fails, what users actually want, and what trade-offs ar=
e acceptable. That knowledge is valuable.
The economists at major AI companies are studying Manus's use cases. They s=
ee tasks worth $3,000 being automated for $200. That's a market opportunity=
 worth pursuing, even with current limitations. Expect to see "Claude Auton=
omous" or "Gemini Executor" pricing tiers at $200-500/month within the year=
=2E
The Broader Implications for AI Development
Manus reveals three critical insights about where AI is headed:
First, specialization is inevitable. We're not getting one AI that does eve=
rything. We're getting specialized tools for specialized tasks. The dream o=
f artificial general intelligence is giving way to the reality of artificia=
l specialized intelligence. Manus is specialized for complex multi-domain w=
orkflows. Other tools will specialize elsewhere.
Second, the human-AI collaboration spectrum is widening. We started with re=
active chatbots. We're moving toward fully autonomous systems. But the midd=
le ground=E2=80=94semi-autonomous, interactive, collaborative=E2=80=94might=
 be the sweet spot for many use cases. Andre Karpathy's recent point about =
focusing too much on full autonomy rings true. Sometimes human judgment at =
key moments is more valuable than complete automation.
Third, the economics will drive adoption patterns. Tools like Manus will pe=
netrate from the top down=E2=80=94starting with high-value use cases where =
ROI is obvious, then becoming cheaper and more accessible as engineering im=
proves. It's the classic enterprise software playbook: start with the despe=
rate customers who need it most, then expand as you solve problems.
Practical Recommendations for September 2025
If you're considering Manus today, here's my advice:
Try it if:
You have specific tasks worth $500-5,000 that you do repeatedly
You can tolerate "good first draft" quality
You have budget for $39-199/month in tool costs
You're comfortable reviewing and refining AI output
Start with:
One clearly defined use case from the five sweet spots
A small test project to calibrate expectations
Clear success criteria before you begin
Budget assumptions of $50-100 per complex task
Avoid if:
Your tasks are simple or well-handled by existing tools
Errors would be costly or embarrassing
You need perfect reproducibility
You're expecting ChatGPT-like simplicity
Think of Manus as: A talented but expensive consultant who needs clear inst=
ructions and produces good first drafts. You wouldn't hire that consultant =
for simple questions or mission-critical decisions. You'd hire them for com=
plex projects where their breadth and independence justify the cost.
The Path Forward
The challenges Manus faces aren't unique to Manus. Every company building a=
utonomous multi-agent systems will hit the same walls. The solutions will c=
ome from three directions:
Architectural Innovation: New approaches to state management, context handl=
ing, and error recovery. Perhaps hierarchical agents, better checkpoint sys=
tems, or novel coordination mechanisms.
Specialized Models: Purpose-built models for orchestration rather than repu=
rposed language models. Models that understand state, can predict resource =
usage, and coordinate effectively.
Hybrid Approaches: Strategic insertion of human judgment at critical points=
=2E Not full automation but intelligent=
 augmentation. Tools that know when to=
 ask for help.
Manus is currently solving the 80% problems. The platform works reliably en=
ough for real use cases. But the last 20%=E2=80=94the edge cases, the compl=
ex failures, the unexpected interactions=E2=80=94those will take time.
Conclusion: The Specialist Tool Phase
I waited to talk about Manus until it stabilized because the story isn't ab=
out Manus specifically. It's about the category Manus represents: autonomou=
s multi-agent orchestrators. These tools show us both the potential and the=
 genuine difficulty of moving beyond conversational AI to execution AI.
The naming problem we started with=E2=80=94the inability to categorize AI t=
ools clearly=E2=80=94matters because it reflects a deeper confusion about w=
hat these tools are for. The MACE framework and the six categories that eme=
rge from it give us a language for making decisions. We can now say precise=
ly what kind of tool we need for what kind of task.
Manus sits firmly in the "expensive specialist tool" category, and that's e=
xactly where it should be given the engineering challenges involved. Like e=
arly computers that filled rooms and cost fortunes but solved valuable prob=
lems, today's autonomous agents are complex, expensive, and limited to high=
-value use cases.
That will change. The engineering challenges will be solved incrementally. =
Costs will come down. Reliability will improve. The major players will ente=
r the market with integrated solutions. But right now, in September 2025, t=
ools like Manus occupy a specific niche: complex, multi-domain workflows wh=
ere the alternative is expensive human labor and where good-enough automati=
on beats perfect manual work.
Understanding that niche=E2=80=94and why it exists=E2=80=94helps us see whe=
re AI agents are actually useful today versus where they're headed tomorrow=
=2E Manus may not be the tool most of u=
s use, but it's showing all of us what=
's coming. And what's coming is a world where AI doesn't just talk about do=
ing things=E2=80=94it actually does them.
The question isn't whether autonomous multi-agent systems will become mains=
tream. They will. The question is who will solve the engineering challenges=
 first, what trade-offs they'll make, and how quickly costs will drop to ma=
instream levels. Manus is placing a bet that being first to market with rea=
l capability, even if expensive and imperfect, beats waiting for perfect so=
lutions.
Based on what I'm seeing, it's not a bad bet.

 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">AI is a slipper=
y technology. It's general purpose, it can do anything, and that makes cate=
gorizing different AI tools almost impossible. Yet naming and categorizing =
is critical for getting work done.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When someone says &quot;=
AI agent,&quot; what do they mean? Claude Code writes code but doesn't just=
 code. Manus writes code too, but also runs it and continues the workflow. =
ChatGPT has &quot;agent mode&quot; but it's not remotely the same thing as =
what Manus does. We keep using the same words for fundamentally different c=
apabilities.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn't academic nitpicking. Organizations =
need predictability to make purchasing decisions. They need to know what th=
ey're buying and when to use it. The current naming chaos makes that imposs=
ible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">Here's a concrete example: A startup founder asks, &q=
uot;Should I use Claude Code or Manus for building my MVP?&quot; Without a =
framework, you can't answer. Both &quot;write code.&quot; Both are &quot;AI=
 agents.&quot; But one writes code for you to review and run, while the oth=
er autonomously builds, deploys, and iterates. They're as different as a te=
xt editor and a software factory, but we call them both &quot;coding agents=
.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">This confusion costs real money. Companies buy the =
wrong tools. Teams spend weeks trying to make a conversational AI do autono=
mous execution. Consultants recommend workflow orchestrators for tasks that=
 need adaptive reasoning. We need a better way to think about these tools.<=

16px;"><strong>First, specialization is inevitable.</strong><span> We're no=

specialized tasks. The dream of artificial general intelligence is giving w=
ay to the reality of artificial specialized intelligence. Manus is speciali=
zed for complex multi-domain workflows. Other tools will specialize elsewhe=
re.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

ving toward fully autonomous systems. But the middle ground=E2=80=94semi-au=
tonomous, interactive, collaborative=E2=80=94might be the sweet spot for ma=
ny use cases. Andre Karpathy's recent point about focusing too much on full=
 autonomy rings true. Sometimes human judgment at key moments is more valua=

 ROI is obvious, then becoming cheaper and more accessible as engineering i=
mproves. It's the classic enterprise software playbook: start with the desp=

</strong><span> New approaches to state management, context handling, and e=

on: The Specialist Tool Phase</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I waited to talk ab=
out Manus until it stabilized because the story isn't about Manus specifica=
lly. It's about the category Manus represents: autonomous multi-agent orche=
strators. These tools show us both the potential and the genuine difficulty=
 of moving beyond conversational AI to execution AI.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The na=
ming problem we started with=E2=80=94the inability to categorize AI tools c=
learly=E2=80=94matters because it reflects a deeper confusion about what th=
ese tools are for. The MACE framework and the six categories that emerge fr=
om it give us a language for making decisions. We can now say precisely wha=
t kind of tool we need for what kind of task.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Manus sits fi=
rmly in the &quot;expensive specialist tool&quot; category, and that's exac=
tly where it should be given the engineering challenges involved. Like earl=
y computers that filled rooms and cost fortunes but solved valuable problem=
s, today's autonomous agents are complex, expensive, and limited to high-va=
lue use cases.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That will change. The engineering challenges=
 will be solved incrementally. Costs will come down. Reliability will impro=
ve. The major players will enter the market with integrated solutions. But =
right now, in September 2025, tools like Manus occupy a specific niche: com=
plex, multi-domain workflows where the alternative is expensive human labor=
 and where good-enough automation beats perfect manual work.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">Understanding that niche=E2=80=94and why it exists=E2=80=94helps us see w=
here AI agents are actually useful today versus where they're headed tomorr=
ow. Manus may not be the tool most of us use, but it's showing all of us wh=
at's coming. And what's coming is a world where AI doesn't just talk about =
doing things=E2=80=94it actually does them.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The question is=
n't whether autonomous multi-agent systems will become mainstream. They wil=
l. The question is who will solve the engineering challenges first, what tr=
ade-offs they'll make, and how quickly costs will drop to mainstream levels=
. Manus is placing a bet that being first to market with real capability, e=
ven if expensive and imperfect, beats waiting for perfect solutions.</p><p =
