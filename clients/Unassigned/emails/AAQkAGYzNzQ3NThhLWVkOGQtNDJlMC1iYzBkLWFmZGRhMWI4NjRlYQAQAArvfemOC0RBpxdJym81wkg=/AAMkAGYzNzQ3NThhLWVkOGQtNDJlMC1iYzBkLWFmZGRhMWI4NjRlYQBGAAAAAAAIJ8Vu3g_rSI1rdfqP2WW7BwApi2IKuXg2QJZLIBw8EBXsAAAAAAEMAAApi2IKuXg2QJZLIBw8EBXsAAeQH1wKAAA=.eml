BREAKING: OpenAI is about to launch Agent Builder=E2=80=94a drag-and-drop i=
nterface that lets you build AI agents without writing code.=20
Put simply: 800 million people are about to get the ability to build AI age=
nts for the first time.
Based on early leaks, this build looks polished to me. You=E2=80=99ll drag =
nodes onto a canvas, connect them with arrows, define logic visually, and w=
ire up external tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol). Very clean, ver=
y simple.
ChatGPT is adding enterprise-friendly guardrails too: prompt injection prot=
ection, content moderation, and other security features that used to requir=
e custom implementation.
At launch ChatGPT will be immediately the biggest agent builder on the plan=
et, with 100x or more scale vs existing tools like n8n or Zapier. OpenAI kn=
ows this.=20
But there=E2=80=99s a problem OpenAI isn=E2=80=99t talking about. There=E2=
=80=99s a substantial gap between building an agent that works once and bui=
lding one that works reliably in production.=20
I=E2=80=99ve spent the last year helping build and shepherd production agen=
ts at large companies. I=E2=80=99ve seen the same mistakes repeated over an=
d over again. I don=E2=80=99t want you to make them, and that=E2=80=99s why=
 I=E2=80=99m writing this piece today.
Put simply, handing everyone the hands-on power to build agents without any=
 kind of build guidance is an invitation to chaos.
This piece is designed to close the agent knowledge gap before it becomes a=
 crisis in your organization.
What=E2=80=99s inside:
Seven hands-on principles for building production agents, based on hard-won=
 experience at scale=E2=80=94and suitable for beginner builders
A set of 12 design prompts you can use to think through your specific use c=
ase systematically, so you don=E2=80=99t have to figure out the build on yo=
ur own
Practical guidance on the architectural shift from workflows to agents
Why dumber agents sometimes win (yes!)
The principles come from things I wish someone had told me before I learned=
 them the expensive way. The prompts are structured conversations that forc=
e you to confront the right questions before you build: What does success l=
ook like? What happens when things fail? How will you know the output is co=
rrect?
Agent building is about to be democratized. What you build in the next few =
months will set patterns=E2=80=94good or bad=E2=80=94that scale across your=
 organization.
Good luck with your new agent-building powers, and build thoughtfully!

Seven Principles for Building Production Agents
OpenAI is launching their Agent Builder product, and hundreds of millions o=
f people are about to have drag-and-drop agent creation powers for the firs=
t time. This is a meaningful shift. What used to require engineering teams =
and custom code can now happen in a visual canvas with pre-built guardrails=
 for prompt injection, content moderation, and other corporate security con=
cerns.
We have some shots of what it looks like courtesy testing catalog [ https:/=
/substack.com/redirect/8497d149-5304-40a3-bae2-144c34520795?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWt=
iOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
The strategy is clear: make agent building so simple and safe-feeling that =
it pulls casual builders into the OpenAI ecosystem. If it=E2=80=99s easier =
to pass IT security review in ChatGPT than in Copilot or Claude, that=E2=80=
=99s where the building happens. And once people feel safe building, they b=
uild more. It becomes a virtuous loop.
But here=E2=80=99s what most people don=E2=80=99t realize yet. There=E2=80=
=99s a substantial gap between designing an agent as a weekend project and =
designing one that works reliably in production. I=E2=80=99ve spent the las=
t year helping build and shepherd production agents at large companies, and=
 I=E2=80=99ve seen the same mistakes repeated over and over. The patterns t=
hat seem obvious when you=E2=80=99re experimenting fall apart when you=E2=
=80=99re running 1,000 workflows a day and someone=E2=80=99s job depends on=
 the output being right.
What follows are seven hard-won principles for building agents that don=E2=
=80=99t break. These aren=E2=80=99t theoretical. They=E2=80=99re the things=
 I wish someone had told me before I learned them the expensive way.
The architectural shift with these AI agents
Before we get to the principles, you need to understand what=E2=80=99s actu=
ally changing with tools like Agent Builder. This isn=E2=80=99t just a pret=
tier interface. It=E2=80=99s a fundamental shift in how agents work.
The old way: you wrote detailed instructions for every single step. Check t=
his database, then if you find X do Y, otherwise do Z. Take that result and=
 format it like this. Send it there. You were essentially writing a recipe =
that had to account for every possible variation.
The new way: you describe what you want accomplished and give the agent acc=
ess to tools. The agent figures out the steps. It decides which tools to us=
e, in what order, and how to handle problems. You=E2=80=99re not managing t=
he step-by-step anymore. You=E2=80=99re defining the goal and the boundarie=
s.
Think of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-turn directi=
ons versus giving them a destination and a GPS. With turn-by-turn direction=
s, you have to anticipate every fork in the road. With a GPS, you say where=
 you want to go and trust the system to navigate, but you still need to be =
clear about the destination and any constraints (avoid highways, no toll ro=
ads).
This changes everything about how you design. Instead of asking =E2=80=9Cwh=
at are the exact steps to accomplish this?=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99re asking =
=E2=80=9Cwhat does this agent need to know to accomplish this goal on its o=
wn?=E2=80=9D Instead of writing detailed if-then logic, you=E2=80=99re sett=
ing up conditions as instructions the agent interprets. Instead of manually=
 coding what to do when things fail, you=E2=80=99re defining recovery strat=
egies the agent follows.
This is why the principles below emphasize clarity, simplicity, and explici=
t constraints. When you=E2=80=99re writing the recipe yourself, you can deb=
ug each step. When the agent is figuring out the recipe, you need to be so =
clear about the goal and the rules that there=E2=80=99s no room for misinte=
rpretation. The control has moved. Your job has changed from micromanager t=
o architect.
Principle 1: Pick a problem that actually matters
This sounds obvious, but it=E2=80=99s where most people fail. When teams st=
art with agents, they tend to pick use cases that aren=E2=80=99t serious. T=
he thinking goes something like: =E2=80=9CThis is new and experimental, I d=
on=E2=80=99t want to wreck anything important, so let me try something low-=
stakes first.=E2=80=9D
That approach is a trap. If you pick a problem that doesn=E2=80=99t matter,=
 you won=E2=80=99t take it seriously. The rest of your organization won=E2=
=80=99t take it seriously. You won=E2=80=99t prioritize debugging it when t=
hings go wrong, and you won=E2=80=99t care enough about whether the output =
is correct to build in the necessary quality checks.
You need to pick a problem where getting it right actually matters. Not rec=
klessly high-stakes for your first build, but meaningful enough that you=E2=
=80=99ll invest the time to make it work properly. This requires some coura=
ge. It also creates the right incentives. When the outcome matters, you des=
ign better systems.
Principle 2: Start with the outcome, not the input
Most people design agents from the beginning of the workflow. They start by=
 thinking about what triggers the agent, what the input looks like, how to =
parse it. Those are important questions, but starting there leads to weak d=
esigns.
Successful agent builds start with the outcome. What do you want this agent=
 to produce? What does =E2=80=9Cdone=E2=80=9D look like in concrete terms? =
And critically: how will you know it=E2=80=99s correct?
The answer to that last question changes dramatically depending on your con=
text. For marketing copy, correctness might mean checking reading level and=
 doing a quick fact-check with another LLM. For healthcare operations where=
 you=E2=80=99re categorizing medical information, correctness means detaile=
d audit trails, secure storage, and zero tolerance for errors.
Think obsessively about what correctness looks like before you build anythi=
ng. Then work backwards from there. This discipline forces you to confront =
the hard questions early: What are the stakes here? What does verification =
look like? How do I prove this worked?
When you adopt this outcome-first mindset, something interesting happens. Y=
ou get stubborn about keeping things simple.
Principle 3: Use the dumbest agent that can do the job
This is the most counterintuitive principle, and the one that makes the big=
gest difference in production.
Your instinct will be to use the most powerful model available. You=E2=80=
=99ll want to juice up the reasoning power and have one smart agent handle =
the entire task. Resist this instinct completely.
In practice, dumb agents work better when they=E2=80=99re fed the right con=
text. What you=E2=80=99re trying to achieve in a business setting is determ=
inistic intelligence. You need predictability. And until we have true reaso=
ning systems with zero hallucination risk, predictability comes from simpli=
city and clarity, not from raw cognitive power.
Hallucinations in a business context are more subtle than making things up.=
 Yes, OpenAI is adding guardrails for egregious hallucinations, which helps=
=2E But those guardrails won=E2=80=99t cat=
ch the cases where your agent follo=
ws the process correctly but makes a different choice because the prompt wa=
s ambiguous. That=E2=80=99s not technically a hallucination. It=E2=80=99s a=
 business logic error caused by poor design.
You avoid these errors by dumbing everything down. Your prompt needs zero a=
mbiguity. Your data sources need to be extremely structured and organized. =
And the model itself should be simple and rule-following. Turn down the rea=
soning power. Let the agent be predictable rather than clever.
Why? Because you=E2=80=99d rather have multiple simple agents doing individ=
ual tasks in sequence than one superintelligent agent trying to do everythi=
ng at once. The simple agents give you audit trails. You can see exactly wh=
at each step did. You can troubleshoot when something breaks. You can verif=
y that step three made the right choice because you designed the context sp=
ecifically for that decision.
The smart agent doing everything at once? You can=E2=80=99t audit it effect=
ively. You can=E2=80=99t see how it did the work. And there will be ambigui=
ty that comes from trying to handle the whole task in one pass.
Is this more work to set up? Yes. But it=E2=80=99s far less work to maintai=
n, debug, and trust.
Principle 4: Design for clean context, not large context
One of the biggest mistakes I see is stuffing the context window with every=
thing that might be relevant and hoping the agent figures it out. This fail=
s in multiple ways.
First, it confuses the model. When you give an agent ambiguous instructions=
 and a bloated context window with no clear signal about what matters, you =
get unpredictable results. The agent is trying to parse your ambiguous huma=
n language, and you=E2=80=99re making its job harder by giving it too much =
to work with.
Second, it burns tokens unnecessarily. Agentic systems run at volume. If yo=
u=E2=80=99re doing 100 blog posts a week or 1,000 health records a day, fat=
 contexts add up fast. Every extra token costs money, and every piece of am=
biguity requires more tokens to parse.
The solution is to be fanatical about context design for each step. What do=
es this specific agent node need to know to make this specific decision? Gi=
ve it exactly that information, structured clearly, and nothing more.
This connects directly to using simpler agents. When you break a workflow i=
nto discrete steps, you can design the perfect context for each step. The r=
etrieval context for step one might look completely different from the cont=
ext for step five, and that=E2=80=99s good. Each agent gets exactly what it=
 needs, formatted exactly how it needs it.
Principle 5: Be ruthlessly clear about tool choice
OpenAI=E2=80=99s Agent Builder is launching with MCP (Model Context Protoco=
l) as the connection layer for external tools. This is probably the widest =
release of MCP we=E2=80=99ve seen. The drag-and-drop simplicity means more =
people will be connecting more tools than ever before.
This creates a new failure mode: tool choice ambiguity.
Your agent needs a clean dictionary of available tools and crystal-clear gu=
idance about when to use each one. Don=E2=80=99t leave the LLM to figure ou=
t which tool to use based on vague instructions. It can choose between tool=
s, but only with explicit guidance from you.
Think about it this way: during each run, the agent reads the retrieval con=
text, reads your prompt, selects a tool, executes it, and returns a respons=
e. Tool selection happens in the middle of that chain. If your prompt is am=
biguous about when to use Tool A versus Tool B, you=E2=80=99ll get unpredic=
table behavior.
The practical advice here is to start with the smallest possible tool colle=
ction. When you see someone=E2=80=99s impressive setup with 20 different MC=
P servers, resist the temptation to copy it. That=E2=80=99s like giving a s=
even-year-old access to a full woodshop and trusting them to pick the right=
 tool. They shouldn=E2=80=99t have that choice yet.
Instead, give each agent the specific tools appropriate to its task. Make s=
ure those tools are clearly differentiated and that your prompt explains un=
ambiguously when to use each one. Then verify that when the agent picks a p=
articular tool, you can see in the logs that it ran successfully.
This is another place where having multiple focused agents in a chain helps=
=2E You can see exactly which agent mad=
e which tool call, and you can debug t=
ool selection problems at the specific step where they occur.
Principle 6: One meaningful goal beats 800 mediocre ones
There=E2=80=99s a tension in what I=E2=80=99m recommending. I told you to p=
ick a problem that matters, but I=E2=80=99m also about to tell you not to b=
ite off too much. These aren=E2=80=99t contradictory.
Pick one goal that has real stakes and do it well. Don=E2=80=99t try to sol=
ve 800 tasks across the business in your first agent build. Don=E2=80=99t e=
ven try to solve eight.
Focus on one meaningful workflow. Build it properly using these principles.=
 Make sure it works reliably. Then expand methodically.
The reason for this discipline is organizational, not technical. Agent buil=
ding is about to become democratized in a way that custom GPTs never achiev=
ed. Custom GPTs are already somewhat chaotic in organizations - different t=
eams with different conventions, no clear ownership, no way to manage them =
centrally.
Now imagine that same chaos, but for production workflows. Marketing has th=
eir own agent conventions that nobody else knows about. Product has a diffe=
rent approach. When Betty goes on vacation, nobody knows how to maintain he=
r workflow because she=E2=80=99s the only one who understands it. And you h=
ave no visibility into which MCP servers are being accessed by which agents=
 across your environment.
This isn=E2=80=99t sustainable.
The answer is to start with organizational standards before the chaos sets =
in. As a team, decide what your standards are for agent builds. Agree on pr=
inciples. Establish what matters: using the simplest possible workflow, the=
 cleanest possible context, the smallest necessary tool collection, prompts=
 that have been vetted for ambiguity.
Build one high-quality example that demonstrates these principles. Then soc=
ialize it. Use it as the template for the next build. Create a culture wher=
e people care about building maintainable agents, not just agents that work=
 once.
Principle 7: Ambiguous prompts create organizational vulnerabilities
This is the principle that ties everything together.
People load their prompts with adjectives and multiple meanings and then wo=
nder why the agent doesn=E2=80=99t behave predictably. They use words that =
have contextual interpretations. They give instructions that could be read =
in different ways depending on what the agent prioritizes.
The agents aren=E2=80=99t magic. They=E2=80=99re trying to parse human lang=
uage that evolved for flexible social communication, not for deterministic =
task execution. When you give ambiguous instructions, you get ambiguous res=
ults.
This might seem like a minor technical issue, but it becomes an organizatio=
nal vulnerability at scale. An insecure agent generating production workloa=
ds that nobody monitors, that nobody can maintain when the builder is out, =
creates real risk.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s safety guardrails help. Prompt injection protection and co=
ntent moderation are valuable. But they=E2=80=99re not sufficient. It=E2=80=
=99s the organization=E2=80=99s job to design policies that actually scale.=
 It=E2=80=99s the team=E2=80=99s job to establish conventions that work for=
 everyone, not just individuals. And it=E2=80=99s your job as a builder to =
create the most maintainable, auditable agent you can.
That means structured instructions with minimal ambiguity. It means clear d=
efinitions of what constitutes success at each step. It means thinking abou=
t the person who will need to debug this six months from now when you=E2=80=
=99ve moved to a different project.
The path forward
You=E2=80=99re about to have significant power. Agent building is moving fr=
om specialized engineering teams to general-purpose drag-and-drop tools. Th=
at=E2=80=99s genuinely exciting. I=E2=80=99ve seen agents do remarkable thi=
ngs when designed well.
But power without discipline creates problems. The most successful agent de=
ployments I=E2=80=99ve seen share a common thread: they were built with pro=
duction in mind from the start. Not as experiments that might become produc=
tion later, but as production systems from day one.
That mindset changes everything. It makes you care about audit trails and c=
ontext design and tool choice clarity. It makes you value simplicity over c=
leverness. It makes you think about maintainability and organizational scal=
ing.
These seven principles are designed to help you build with that mindset. Th=
ey=E2=80=99re meant to help you create agents that are less likely to break=
, easier to debug when they do, and sustainable for your team to maintain o=
ver time.
The agent revolution is here. Build thoughtfully.
Don=E2=80=99t build alone=E2=80=94prompts to help
Reading principles is one thing. Applying them to your specific use case is=
 another. The prompts below are designed to walk you through agent design d=
ecisions systematically. Think of them as structured conversations with you=
rself=E2=80=94or with your team=E2=80=94that force you to confront the hard=
 questions before you start building.=20
I=E2=80=99ve used variations of these with teams building production agents=
 at scale. They work because they make the implicit explicit. Instead of as=
suming you=E2=80=99ve thought through error handling or tool choice or cont=
ext design, they make you write it down. That act of articulation catches p=
roblems early, when they=E2=80=99re cheap to fix rather than expensive to d=
ebug.=20
You don=E2=80=99t need to use every prompt. Pick the ones relevant to your =
build. But I=E2=80=99d strongly recommend starting with the Core Agent Desi=
gn Prompt regardless of your use case. It establishes the foundation: what =
triggers this thing, what does success look like, and what happens when thi=
ngs go wrong. Everything else builds from there.=20
These aren=E2=80=99t templates to fill out once and forget. They=E2=80=99re=
 thinking tools. Come back to them when you=E2=80=99re debugging, when you=
=E2=80=99re expanding to a new use case, or when you=E2=80=99re trying to e=
xplain to someone else why your agent is designed the way it is. The discip=
line of working through them will make you a better agent builder.
Core Agent Design Prompt
You=E2=80=99re designing an AI agent using OpenAI=E2=80=99s Agent Builder, =

agent building so simple and safe-feeling that it pulls casual builders int=
o the OpenAI ecosystem. If it=E2=80=99s easier to pass IT security review i=

 as a weekend project and designing one that works reliably in production. =
I=E2=80=99ve spent the last year helping build and shepherd production agen=
ts at large companies, and I=E2=80=99ve seen the same mistakes repeated ove=

">The architectural shift with these AI agents</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Before we g=
et to the principles, you need to understand what=E2=80=99s actually changi=
ng with tools like Agent Builder. This isn=E2=80=99t just a prettier interf=
ace. It=E2=80=99s a fundamental shift in how agents work.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">T=
he old way: you wrote detailed instructions for every single step. Check th=
is database, then if you find X do Y, otherwise do Z. Take that result and =
format it like this. Send it there. You were essentially writing a recipe t=
hat had to account for every possible variation.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The new wa=
y: you describe what you want accomplished and give the agent access to too=
ls. The agent figures out the steps. It decides which tools to use, in what=
 order, and how to handle problems. You=E2=80=99re not managing the step-by=
-step anymore. You=E2=80=99re defining the goal and the boundaries.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Think of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-tur=
n directions versus giving them a destination and a GPS. With turn-by-turn =
directions, you have to anticipate every fork in the road. With a GPS, you =
say where you want to go and trust the system to navigate, but you still ne=
ed to be clear about the destination and any constraints (avoid highways, n=
o toll roads).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This changes everything about how you design=
. Instead of asking =E2=80=9Cwhat are the exact steps to accomplish this?=
=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99re asking =E2=80=9Cwhat does this agent need to know =
to accomplish this goal on its own?=E2=80=9D Instead of writing detailed if=
-then logic, you=E2=80=99re setting up conditions as instructions the agent=
 interprets. Instead of manually coding what to do when things fail, you=E2=
=80=99re defining recovery strategies the agent follows.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Th=
is is why the principles below emphasize clarity, simplicity, and explicit =
constraints. When you=E2=80=99re writing the recipe yourself, you can debug=
 each step. When the agent is figuring out the recipe, you need to be so cl=
ear about the goal and the rules that there=E2=80=99s no room for misinterp=
retation. The control has moved. Your job has changed from micromanager to =
architect.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;=

px;font-size: 16px;">This sounds obvious, but it=E2=80=99s where most peopl=
e fail. When teams start with agents, they tend to pick use cases that aren=
=E2=80=99t serious. The thinking goes something like: =E2=80=9CThis is new =
and experimental, I don=E2=80=99t want to wreck anything important, so let =
me try something low-stakes first.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That approach i=
s a trap. If you pick a problem that doesn=E2=80=99t matter, you won=E2=80=
=99t take it seriously. The rest of your organization won=E2=80=99t take it=
 seriously. You won=E2=80=99t prioritize debugging it when things go wrong,=
 and you won=E2=80=99t care enough about whether the output is correct to b=

oblem where getting it right actually matters. Not recklessly high-stakes f=
or your first build, but meaningful enough that you=E2=80=99ll invest the t=
ime to make it work properly. This requires some courage. It also creates t=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">Most people design agents from the beginning of the workflow. The=
y start by thinking about what triggers the agent, what the input looks lik=
e, how to parse it. Those are important questions, but starting there leads=
 to weak designs.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Successful agent builds start with the ou=
tcome. What do you want this agent to produce? What does =E2=80=9Cdone=E2=
=80=9D look like in concrete terms? And critically: how will you know it=E2=
=80=99s correct?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The answer to that last question changes d=
ramatically depending on your context. For marketing copy, correctness migh=
t mean checking reading level and doing a quick fact-check with another LLM=
. For healthcare operations where you=E2=80=99re categorizing medical infor=
mation, correctness means detailed audit trails, secure storage, and zero t=
olerance for errors.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

e biggest difference in production.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=
: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Your instinct will be t=
o use the most powerful model available. You=E2=80=99ll want to juice up th=
e reasoning power and have one smart agent handle the entire task. Resist t=
his instinct completely.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">In practice, dumb agents work bett=
er when they=E2=80=99re fed the right context. What you=E2=80=99re trying t=
o achieve in a business setting is deterministic intelligence. You need pre=
dictability. And until we have true reasoning systems with zero hallucinati=
on risk, predictability comes from simplicity and clarity, not from raw cog=
nitive power.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Hallucinations in a business context are more=
 subtle than making things up. Yes, OpenAI is adding guardrails for egregio=
us hallucinations, which helps. But those guardrails won=E2=80=99t catch th=
e cases where your agent follows the process correctly but makes a differen=
t choice because the prompt was ambiguous. That=E2=80=99s not technically a=
 hallucination. It=E2=80=99s a business logic error caused by poor design.<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">You avoid these errors by dumbing everything down. Your pro=
mpt needs zero ambiguity. Your data sources need to be extremely structured=
 and organized. And the model itself should be simple and rule-following. T=
urn down the reasoning power. Let the agent be predictable rather than clev=
er.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">Why? Because you=E2=80=99d rather have multiple simple =
agents doing individual tasks in sequence than one superintelligent agent t=
rying to do everything at once. The simple agents give you audit trails. Yo=
u can see exactly what each step did. You can troubleshoot when something b=
reaks. You can verify that step three made the right choice because you des=
igned the context specifically for that decision.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =

ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">One of the biggest mistakes I see is stuf=
fing the context window with everything that might be relevant and hoping t=
he agent figures it out. This fails in multiple ways.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First=
, it confuses the model. When you give an agent ambiguous instructions and =
a bloated context window with no clear signal about what matters, you get u=
npredictable results. The agent is trying to parse your ambiguous human lan=
guage, and you=E2=80=99re making its job harder by giving it too much to wo=
rk with.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, it burns tokens unnecessarily. Agentic sys=
tems run at volume. If you=E2=80=99re doing 100 blog posts a week or 1,000 =
health records a day, fat contexts add up fast. Every extra token costs mon=
ey, and every piece of ambiguity requires more tokens to parse.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The solution is to be fanatical about context design for each step. Wh=
at does this specific agent node need to know to make this specific decisio=
n? Give it exactly that information, structured clearly, and nothing more.<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">This connects directly to using simpler agents. When you br=
eak a workflow into discrete steps, you can design the perfect context for =
each step. The retrieval context for step one might look completely differe=
nt from the context for step five, and that=E2=80=99s good. Each agent gets=
 exactly what it needs, formatted exactly how it needs it.</p><h2 class=3D"=

I=E2=80=99s Agent Builder is launching with MCP (Model Context Protocol) as=
 the connection layer for external tools. This is probably the widest relea=
se of MCP we=E2=80=99ve seen. The drag-and-drop simplicity means more peopl=
e will be connecting more tools than ever before.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =
0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This crea=

0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Your agent n=
eeds a clean dictionary of available tools and crystal-clear guidance about=
 when to use each one. Don=E2=80=99t leave the LLM to figure out which tool=
 to use based on vague instructions. It can choose between tools, but only =
with explicit guidance from you.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think about it this way: d=
uring each run, the agent reads the retrieval context, reads your prompt, s=
elects a tool, executes it, and returns a response. Tool selection happens =
in the middle of that chain. If your prompt is ambiguous about when to use =
Tool A versus Tool B, you=E2=80=99ll get unpredictable behavior.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">The practical advice here is to start with the smallest possible tool=
 collection. When you see someone=E2=80=99s impressive setup with 20 differ=
ent MCP servers, resist the temptation to copy it. That=E2=80=99s like givi=
ng a seven-year-old access to a full woodshop and trusting them to pick the=
 right tool. They shouldn=E2=80=99t have that choice yet.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=
nstead, give each agent the specific tools appropriate to its task. Make su=
re those tools are clearly differentiated and that your prompt explains una=
mbiguously when to use each one. Then verify that when the agent picks a pa=
rticular tool, you can see in the logs that it ran successfully.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

 helps. You can see exactly which agent made which tool call, and you can d=
ebug tool selection problems at the specific step where they occur.</p><h2 =

 no clear ownership, no way to manage them centrally.</p><p style=3D"margin=

approach. When Betty goes on vacation, nobody knows how to maintain her wor=
