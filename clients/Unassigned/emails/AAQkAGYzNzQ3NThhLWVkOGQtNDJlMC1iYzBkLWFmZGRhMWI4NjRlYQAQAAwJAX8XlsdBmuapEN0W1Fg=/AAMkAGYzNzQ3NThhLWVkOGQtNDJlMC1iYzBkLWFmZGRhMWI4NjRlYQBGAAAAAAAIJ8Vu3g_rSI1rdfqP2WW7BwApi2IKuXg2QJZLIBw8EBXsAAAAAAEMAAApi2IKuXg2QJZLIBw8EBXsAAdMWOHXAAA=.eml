In January, Goldman CEO David Soloman said that 95% of the process of
building an IPO prospectus (something a bank has to do before going
public on a stock exchange) can now be done by AI. So a six-week
process for a medium sized team is now more or less a
point-and-click.=C2=A0=C2=A0

That is a serious cost saving influence, isn=E2=80=99t it? When you slash
banker hours but keep the fee schedule pretty much the same,
incremental revenue turns into operating-leverage rocket fuel.

I=E2=80=99m fairly sure GS isn=E2=80=99t going to tell its next client: =E2=
=80=9Cyou
know what, we saved 50% on this IPO and we=E2=80=99d like to pass those
savings on to you because we=E2=80=99re such good people.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 No=
pe,
probably not. Profit margins - wow.

And how many deals and IPOs are we going to be seeing in the new
inference phase of AI that I=E2=80=99ve been talking about for 6 weeks?
Inference boom =3D IPO rush. Gonna be lit.

Add the regulatory tailwinds that Trump is likely to push (lower
capital requirements and streamlining listing rules) and the earnings
report will sing.

Need more? At 1.4x book and 11x forward earnings, GS is an AI sideplay
that I=E2=80=99m very excited about.

MY BEARISH PICK: USO

In all my shows I=E2=80=99ve been saying short oil. I felt that Iran/Israel
wouldn=E2=80=99t last and that threats to close the Strait of Hormuz were
just that: threats.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0

And the macro backdrop now tilts outright deflationary. With Gulf
producers, U.S. shale outfits, and even previously sanctioned
suppliers eager to pump at anything north of $70, supply is poised to
swell just as global growth indicators cool.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0

That one-two punch of softer demand and rising output is bad news for
spot crude, but it=E2=80=99s even worse for the UNITED STATES OIL FUND LP
(TICKER: USO). The fund must continually roll front-month futures, and
in a contangoed market that roll yield bleeds value month after month.

Bottom line? There are plenty of smarter ways to express an energy
view right now, which I=E2=80=99m not interested in doing. But in an
over-supplied, slow-growth tape, USO looks like the wrong tool for the
job.=C2=A0=C2=A0

Deflation, slowing growth, USO is dead money at best.
