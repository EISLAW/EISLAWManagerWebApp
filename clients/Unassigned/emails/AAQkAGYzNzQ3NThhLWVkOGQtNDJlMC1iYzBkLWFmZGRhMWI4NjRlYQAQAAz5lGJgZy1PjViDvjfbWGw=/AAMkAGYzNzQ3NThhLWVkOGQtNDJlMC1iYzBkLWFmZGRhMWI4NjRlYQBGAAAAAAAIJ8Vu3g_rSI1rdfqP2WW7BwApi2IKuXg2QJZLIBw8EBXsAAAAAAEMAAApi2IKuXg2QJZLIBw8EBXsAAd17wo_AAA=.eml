Work is changing, and we need to talk about it.=20
No, I don=E2=80=99t mean the jobs thing! Everyone writes about AI and jobs =
all the time (and sometimes I do too). Today I want to call out that how we=
 work is changing fast, and we don=E2=80=99t have the vocabulary for it. We=
 need to talk about a new way of working that=E2=80=99s AI native.
I've been building products for fifteen years. In that time, I've watched u=
s digitize everything except the actual work of making decisions. We moved =
from paper to pixels, from filing cabinets to cloud storage, from conferenc=
e rooms to Zoom. But we're still making decisions the same way we did in 19=
95: gathering data, making slides, having meetings, following up with more =
slides.
Last month, I watched a brilliant engineering team spend two weeks preparin=
g for a launch review that should have taken thirty minutes. They knew they=
 were ready to ship. Everyone knew it. But they needed the ritual=E2=80=94t=
he deck, the appendix, the backup slides no one would read. They needed per=
mission to trust their own judgment.
That's when it hit me: AI hasn't just given us better tools. It's given us =
the ability to completely reimagine how decisions get made.
What follows is the most important piece I've written about the future of w=
ork. It's not about AI taking jobs or making us more creative. It's about r=
eplacing the entire operating system of how organizations function=E2=80=94=
moving from static documents to living instruments that make decisions exec=
utable, auditable, and fast.
I'm going to show you exactly how to build these instruments. Not in theory=
=E2=80=94with actual prompts you can use today. Twelve complete examples co=
vering everything from weekly business reviews to launch gates to customer =
health scoring.
This isn't speculation. These patterns are emerging right now at companies =
you know. The question isn't whether this shift will happen. It's whether y=
ou'll be ahead of it or behind it.
Let me show you how to get ahead.

From Documents to Instruments: A New Operating Surface for Work
Interactive artifacts are replacing static deliverables. The implications r=
un deeper than you think.
We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how work gets done. ChatGPT-5, Clau=
de, Gemini=E2=80=94they're all converging on the same capability: transform=
ing conversations into executable artifacts that make decisions fast, audit=
able, and final.
This isn't about AI replacing jobs. It's about replacing the bureaucratic s=
ludge that makes our jobs miserable.
The real bottleneck in modern companies isn't creativity. AI solved that pr=
oblem two years ago. Need 100 ideas? Done. The real drag is the cost of pro=
ving a decision. We burn weeks turning data into spreadsheets, spreadsheets=
 into slides, slides into meetings, meetings into more slides.
Now chats are becoming all three=E2=80=94docs, spreadsheets, and slides=E2=
=80=94instantly. But we're still bolting our old decision-making processes =
onto this new capability. We're missing the bigger opportunity.
The Threshold We Just Crossed
With ChatGPT-5's canvas feature reaching 700 million users, we've crossed a=
 critical threshold. For the first time, non-coders can create interactive =
artifacts that collapse entire decision chains into single, executable mome=
nts.
These aren't documents. They're instruments=E2=80=94front-end artifacts wit=
h typed inputs, live logic, embedded tests, and clean outputs. Run them, ca=
pture the decision, move on.
A good instrument replaces several meetings and a deck with one surface and=
 one decision. No follow-ups. No "let me get back to you." No death by Powe=
rPoint.
Four factors make this possible now:
Distribution is solved. Single-file canvases travel as easily as slides. Sh=
are a ChatGPT or Claude artifact with a link. No infrastructure. No deploym=
ent. It just works.
Cost approaches zero. Your team already has ChatGPT or Claude subscriptions=
=2E The canvas comes free. No procureme=
nt. No IT approval. No additional budg=
et.
Governance is embedded. Tests and approvals live in the instrument itself. =
The audit trail isn't in some separate system=E2=80=94it's right there in t=
he artifact. Screenshot it if you need to lock it down.
Improvements compound. These artifacts aren't static. They're living. Each =
week's business review instrument gets better than the last. Edge cases get=
 captured. Tests get refined. Knowledge accumulates.
Anatomy of an Instrument
An instrument isn't just a dashboard or a form. It has six essential compon=
ents:
Typed inputs with explicit schemas. Not free text fields=E2=80=94structured=
 data with validation. Numbers are numbers. Dates are ISO-8601. Percentages=
 are 0-1 scale. No ambiguity.
Visible logic you can inspect and test. The code is right there. You can se=
e exactly how decisions are calculated, what thresholds matter, which edge =
cases are handled.
Minimal UI with clear affordances. A scoreboard display with a few critical=
 knobs. Present mode for meetings. What-if sliders for scenarios. Not 50 op=
tions=E2=80=94just the ones that matter.
Tests as gates. Red blocks don't export. If data quality is bad, it stops. =
If required approvals are missing, it stops. If thresholds are breached, it=
 alerts. The policy is the code.
Built-in audit trail. Every run captures who, what, when, and why. Changes =
are tracked. Assumptions are explicit. Six months later, you can reconstruc=
t exactly why a decision was made.
Clean exports in JSON and Markdown. The decision record that satisfies comp=
liance, feeds downstream systems, and goes into the permanent file.
Take these components seriously. An instrument without an audit trail is ju=
st a calculator. An instrument without tests is just a dashboard. The power=
 comes from the complete package.
How Work Actually Changes
When you start running meetings inside instruments, everything shifts.
The instrument becomes the agenda, the analysis, the gate, and the record s=
imultaneously. If it isn't in the instrument, it didn't happen. No more "I =
think we decided X but let me check my notes." The decision is encoded.
Tests come first, not last. Thresholds and approvals aren't guidelines=E2=
=80=94they're code. A launch either passes the readiness gate or it doesn't=
=2E A deal either meets margin requirem=
ents or it doesn't. The instrument won=
't let you proceed with a failed test.
Policy becomes code. Legal publishes rule versions the artifact enforces. R=
isk sets thresholds the instrument checks. Finance defines margin floors th=
at block non-compliant deals. Changing policy means changing tests and rele=
asing a new version.
Leaders have to model the behavior. Ask for the instrument, not the slide. =
Tweak assumptions live in the meeting. When the VP stops accepting PowerPoi=
nts and starts demanding instruments, the culture shifts.
Operators own outcomes. The sales leader owns the deal desk instrument. The=
 engineering lead owns the launch gate. The finance lead owns the pricing s=
imulator. They're accountable for the verdicts their instruments produce.
Evidence becomes free. Every decision is reproducible. Baselines, hashes, a=
nd exports eliminate the separate "board pack." When someone asks "why did =
we make that call?" you pull up the exact instrument with the exact inputs.
The Real Challenge: Culture, Not Technology
Building these instruments is technically straightforward. ChatGPT and Clau=
de can generate them from prompts. The real challenges are cultural.
Over-trust is dangerous. People see numbers in a dashboard and assume they'=
re correct. But garbage in still means garbage out. You need visible assump=
tions, upstream data quality checks, and clear failure modes.
Sprawl kills adoption. Without discipline, you get 50 versions of the same =
artifact. One team's WBR looks nothing like another's. Trust erodes. You ne=
ed naming conventions, version control, and someone who owns convergence.
Instruments can narrow thinking. When every pricing decision runs through t=
he same simulator, it's easy to stop questioning the underlying model. You =
need deliberate processes for challenging the instruments themselves.
The solution isn't to avoid instruments. It's to manage them like any criti=
cal business process.
Making the Transition Stick
Stand up an Instrument Studio=E2=80=94a small team of design, frontend, and=
 data people who maintain standards. They don't build every instrument. The=
y maintain schemas, testing patterns, export formats, and quality bars that=
 let everyone else build.
Assign policy stewards to each instrument class. Legal owns the contract ri=
sk triage rules. Finance owns the deal desk thresholds. The steward owns th=
e rules, not the ceremony.
Change your incentive structure. Stop rewarding presentations delivered. St=
art rewarding decisions shipped through gates. Track cycle time from questi=
on to decision. Measure the percentage of decisions with clear audit trails=
=2E
Map instruments to your operating cadence. Weekly business reviews, launch =
readiness, incident response, pricing reviews, customer health checks=E2=80=
=94each gets its own instrument pattern. Consistency builds trust.
Start with experimentation but drive toward convergence. Let teams try diff=
erent approaches initially, then pick winners and standardize. The AWS team=
's launch gate becomes the launch gate. The sales team's deal desk becomes =
the deal desk.
Manage versions aggressively. Instruments have owners, semantic versioning,=
 and deprecation schedules. Old versions get sunset. New versions get relea=
se notes. This isn't chaos=E2=80=94it's managed evolution.
The Platform Opportunity
If you're building tools=E2=80=94Word, Docs, Notion, Sheets=E2=80=94your pr=
oduct is no longer a document editor. It's an execution surface.
The winners will ship primitives for instruments: typed input blocks, logic=
 components, test gates, audit trails, and stable export formats. "Run" bec=
omes as important as "Edit" or "Comment." The entire flow of "Run =E2=86=92=
 Record =E2=86=92 Share" should be one gesture.
Distribution and safety become your moat. Single-file artifacts that run sa=
ndboxed in browsers. No infrastructure setup. Deterministic, inspectable lo=
gic with clear separation between inputs, generated code, and evaluation.
Value accrues at runtime, not authoring time. It doesn't matter who writes =
the best PRD. It matters whose instrument produces the clearest decision fa=
stest. Price on active instruments, certified runs, and governed seats=E2=
=80=94not document storage.
Policy as code becomes a platform primitive. Rule DSLs, versioned tests, ap=
proval workflows, and compliance certificates. The ability to say "this dec=
ision passed version 2.1.3 of our margin policy" and prove it.
12 Instruments
I've created a dozen instruments that work together as a coherent operating=
 system. Each includes a complete prompt you can paste into ChatGPT or Clau=
de today.
Run the Business
WBR Scorecard: 8-week trending with sparklines, channel mix, and anomaly de=
tection
Data Quality Sentinel: Freshness monitoring, null checks, duplicate detecti=
on, drift alerts
Ship Decisions
Experiment Decision Pad: Statistical significance, guardrail checks, power =
analysis
Launch Readiness Gate: Multi-function go/no-go with evidence requirements
Manage Reliability
Incident Commander Board: Real-time incident tracking, MTTR calculation, ac=
tion assignment
Support SLA Radar: Response time heatmaps, breach tracking, escalation path=
s
Control Revenue & Risk
Deal Desk Guard: Margin validation, discount approval, terms compliance
Contract Risk Triage: Automated review for NDAs, MSAs, and DPAs
Optimize Customers
Customer Health Triage: Multi-signal scoring, churn prediction, interventio=
n triggers
Pricing & Mix Simulator: Elasticity modeling, channel optimization, scenari=
o planning
Scale People
Hiring Funnel Health: Conversion tracking, source effectiveness, time-to-fi=
ll analysis
Access Review Runner: SoD detection, orphaned accounts, stale permission cl=
eanup
These aren't templates. They're working instruments. Customize them. Remix =
them. Make them yours. The prompts are opinionated about structure but flex=
ible about implementation.
The Strategic Bet
We're moving the center of gravity from narrative to execution. Instruments=
 don't kill documents=E2=80=94they demote them. Docs capture context. Instr=
uments produce decisions.
This isn't about small productivity gains. Companies that figure this out w=
ill operate at a fundamentally different clock speed. While competitors sch=
edule follow-ups to review last week's analysis, these companies will have =
run three instruments, made five decisions, and moved to the next problem.
The technology is here. The patterns are proven. The only question is wheth=
er you'll start using them.
Pick one decision that currently requires a deck. Replace it with an instru=
ment this week. Run your next meeting inside the artifact. Capture the deci=
sion. Move on.
Then do it again.
Welcome to the new operating surface of work. We're all going to figure it =
out together.

Start Today
These 12 instruments are just the beginning. They're not perfect. They're n=
ot complete. But they give you a starting point, and that's what matters.
The shift from documents to instruments isn't coming=E2=80=94it's here. Eve=
ry week you wait is another week of unnecessary meetings, redundant analysi=
s, and delayed decisions. Every deck you create is time you could have spen=
t running an instrument and moving to the next problem.
Start small. Pick the decision that annoys you most. The weekly review that=
 takes three hours to prepare. The launch gate that requires six approvals =
via email. The pricing discussion that never quite resolves. Build an instr=
ument for it. Run it once. It won't be perfect, but it will be better than =
what you have now.
Then expand. Share the instrument with your team. Let them modify it. Watch=
 it improve. Soon you'll have five instruments, then ten, then a complete o=
perating system running on interactive artifacts instead of static document=
s.
The companies that embrace this shift won't just be faster. They'll be play=
ing a different game. They'll make decisions in minutes that take their com=
petitors weeks. They'll have audit trails their competitors can't produce. =
They'll run experiments their competitors can't even imagine.
The tools are out there. The knowledge is here. The only barrier is inertia=
=2E
Copy these prompts. Paste them into ChatGPT or Claude. Customize them for y=
our context. Run your next meeting inside an instrument. Capture the decisi=
on. Move forward.
The future of work isn't about AI replacing humans. It's about humans with =
instruments replacing humans with PowerPoint.
Build your first instrument today.

 matter, which edge cases are handled.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

 Not 50 options=E2=80=94just the ones that matter.</span></p><p style=3D"ma=

strong>Tests as gates.</strong><span> Red blocks don't export. If data qual=
ity is bad, it stops. If required approvals are missing, it stops. If thres=
holds are breached, it alerts. The policy is the code.</span></p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

n is encoded.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=

provals aren't guidelines=E2=80=94they're code. A launch either passes the =
readiness gate or it doesn't. A deal either meets margin requirements or it=
 doesn't. The instrument won't let you proceed with a failed test.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=

and releasing a new version.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Leaders have to model the beha=

meeting. When the VP stops accepting PowerPoints and starts demanding instr=
uments, the culture shifts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

- alertThreshold:number (0.05=E2=80=930.30)
- logicVersion:string

UI:
- KPI cards (Revenue, Orders, Active, CAC) with WoW (invert CAC).
- **Delta rule:** if last=3D=3D0 =E2=86=92 delta=3Dnull; render &quot;=E2=

- Sparklines across 8 weeks.
- Channel table (This vs Last, WoW, Share) labeled with channelMetric.
- History Editor (edit all 8 weeks), Present mode.
- Copy Markdown/JSON. Tests Gate at top.

Logic:
- WoW =3D (this-last)/last; CAC uses invert flag.
- Anomalies =3D |WoW| =E2=89=A5 alertThreshold.

Tests:
- All week.kpi finite across 8 weeks.

    B:{ users:number, convCount:number, revenuePerUser:number }
  }
- priors:{ mde:number, riskAppetite:&quot;low&quot;|&quot;medium&quot;|&quo=

- logicVersion:string

UI:
- Inputs left; Decision right: convRate, lift, **Wilson/Agresti=E2=80=93Cou=
ll CI** (pick one), power vs MDE.
- Guardrails with PASS/FAIL; &quot;minor&quot; breach if within 10% of thre=
shold.
- What-if sliders: users and expected lift. Tests Gate at top.

Logic:
- convRate =3D convCount/users; lift =3D (rB-rA)/rA.
- Decision PASS if CI excludes 0 and guardrail breaches =E2=89=A4 riskPolic=

Tests:
- users, convCount =E2=89=A5 0; **revenuePerUser =E2=89=A5 0**.
- Sample ratio sanity: |A.users - B.users|/(A.users+B.users) =E2=89=A4 0.02=

 that takes three hours to prepare. The launch gate that requires six appro=
vals via email. The pricing discussion that never quite resolves. Build an =
instrument for it. Run it once. It won't be perfect, but it will be better =
than what you have now.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=

instruments, then ten, then a complete operating system running on interact=
