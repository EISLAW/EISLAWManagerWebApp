1. From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meani=
ng
Watching: Compression vs. Meaning (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/c9=
8d7a98-aab9-46f2-bb01-57d28eb137ca?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) =
represent knowledge is crucial for advancing AI, yet we don't fully grasp w=
hether they process concepts like humans do. While humans excel at semantic=
 compression - organizing diverse instances into meaningful categories (lik=
e grouping robins and eagles as "birds") - this process involves a delicate=
 balance. We trade off between keeping representations simple and preservin=
g semantic richness. The fundamental question is: Do LLMs achieve this same=
 balance between compression and meaning that characterizes human cognition=
, or do they use fundamentally different strategies?
How does it solve the problem? The researchers (among them, Yann LeCun) dev=
eloped a new information-theoretic framework combining Rate-Distortion Theo=
ry and the Information Bottleneck principle to quantitatively measure how b=
oth humans and LLMs balance compression with semantic fidelity. They analyz=
ed token embeddings from various LLMs (ranging from BERT to Llama models) a=
nd compared them against classic human categorization benchmarks from cogni=
tive psychology. Using metrics like mutual information and clustering analy=
sis, they assessed conceptual alignment, internal semantic structure, and o=
verall representational efficiency between human and AI systems.
What are the key findings? The study reveals a fundamental divergence in ho=
w LLMs and humans manage information. While LLMs successfully form broad ca=
tegories that align with human judgment, they fail to capture fine-grained =
semantic distinctions like item typicality (e.g., recognizing that a robin =
is a more "typical" bird than a penguin). Most strikingly, LLMs demonstrate=
 aggressive statistical compression - they minimize redundancy and maximize=
 efficiency by information-theoretic measures. In contrast, human conceptua=
l systems appear "inefficient" by these metrics, suggesting humans optimize=
 for adaptive richness and contextual flexibility rather than pure compress=
ion.
Why does it matter? These results challenge the assumption that scaling up =
LLMs will naturally lead to human-like understanding. The stark difference =
in representational strategies suggests that current AI architectures may b=
e fundamentally limited in achieving genuine comprehension. While LLMs exce=
l at statistical pattern matching through aggressive compression, human cog=
nition prioritizes semantic richness and adaptive flexibility - qualities e=
ssential for navigating complex, real-world scenarios. This might be crucia=
l for developing next-generation AI systems that move beyond surface-level =
mimicry toward deeper, more human-aligned understanding.

2. AlphaOne: Reasoning Models Thinking Slow and Fast at Test Time
Watching:  AlphaOne (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/ce5cea63-1c4b-42=
9f-a978-613bfd65a218?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6R=
xQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code coming soon [ https://substack.com/redirect/5681b955-7=
456-4df3-b02c-445a36cebf8b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7B=
DnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI's o1 =
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks,=
 but they suffer from a Goldilocks problem - they either think too much (ov=
erthinking) or too little (underthinking). Think of it like a student solvi=
ng a math problem who either gets stuck in unnecessary calculations or rush=
es through without proper consideration. These models struggle to find the =
sweet spot between what psychologists call System 1 (fast, intuitive thinki=
ng) and System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking). Current approaches try to fix=
 this by either forcing more thinking or cutting it short, but these one-si=
ze-fits-all solutions aren't optimal for different types of problems.
How does it solve the problem? AlphaOne (=CE=B11) acts like a smart reasoni=
ng scheduler. The key innovation is the "=CE=B1 moment" - imagine it as a t=
imer that determines how long the model should spend in its thinking phase,=
 scaled by a parameter =CE=B1. Before this moment, =CE=B11 uses a clever pr=
obability-based system (Bernoulli process) to insert "wait" tokens that tri=
gger slower, more careful thinking - like adding strategic pauses in a conv=
ersation. After the =CE=B1 moment, it switches gears by replacing any furth=
er "wait" tokens with end-of-thinking markers, essentially telling the mode=
l "okay, time to wrap up and give your answer." This creates a natural slow=
-to-fast reasoning flow, rather than the rigid all-or-nothing approaches us=
ed before.
What are the key findings? The empirical results across mathematical, codin=
g, and scientific benchmarks show that =CE=B11 significantly outperforms ex=
isting methods in both reasoning quality and efficiency. The framework demo=
nstrates superior performance while being more flexible than previous appro=
aches - it can handle both sparse adjustments (occasional tweaks) and dense=
 modulation (frequent fine-tuning) of the reasoning process. Importantly, =
=CE=B11 successfully balances the trade-off between thinking deeply enough =
to solve complex problems and being efficient enough to be practical, achie=
ving what the authors call "dense slow-to-fast reasoning modulation."
Why does it matter? These findings matter because they provide a practical =
solution to make AI reasoning both smarter and more efficient. As LLMs are =
increasingly deployed for complex tasks in science, mathematics, and progra=
mming, having a framework that can dynamically adjust reasoning depth based=
 on the problem at hand is crucial. =CE=B11's approach is particularly valu=
able because it's universal - it can be applied to different models and doe=
sn't require retraining. This means existing LRMs can be immediately improv=
ed, making them more reliable for real-world applications where both accura=
cy and computational efficiency matter. The work also provides insights int=
o how AI reasoning differs from human cognition, suggesting that optimal AI=
 reasoning might follow different patterns than human thought processes.
3. How much do language models memorize?
Watching: LLM Memorization (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e10d9b6a-=
e61a-42d1-8a06-5c317e1136e7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? The widespread deployment of large language mod=
els has raised critical questions about what these models actually memorize=
 from their training data. While previous work has tried to measure memoriz=
ation through extraction attacks or membership inference, these approaches =
fail to distinguish between genuine memorization and generalization. For in=
stance, if a model correctly answers "What is 2^100?", is it memorizing the=
 specific answer or generalizing from mathematical patterns? This distincti=
on matters enormously for understanding model capacity, privacy risks, and =
the fundamental nature of how LLMs store and retrieve information.
How does it solve the problem? The authors propose a new framework that dec=
omposes memorization into two distinct components: unintended memorization =
(information about specific datasets) and generalization (knowledge about t=
he underlying data-generation process). They leverage compression theory an=
d Kolmogorov complexity to quantify memorization in bits. To isolate pure m=
emorization from generalization, they first train models on uniformly rando=
m bitstrings where no generalization is possible. Then they repeat experime=
nts with real text, using larger "oracle" models as references to separate =
sample-specific memorization from general patterns. This clever approach al=
lows them to measure the exact information capacity of transformer models.
What are the key findings? They discovered that GPT-style transformers have=
 a remarkably consistent capacity of approximately 3.6 bits-per-parameter, =
regardless of model size. They observed that models memorize training data =
until reaching this capacity limit, at which point "grokking" occurs - the =
model shifts from memorizing individual samples to learning generalizable p=
atterns. This transition point coincides exactly with the double descent ph=
enomenon. Additionally, they developed scaling laws that accurately predict=
 membership inference performance based on model capacity and dataset size,=
 showing that modern LLMs trained on massive datasets make reliable members=
hip inference practically impossible for average datapoints.
Why does it matter? These results provide the first principled measurement =
of language model capacity and offer a unified explanation for several puzz=
ling phenomena in deep learning. The 3.6 bits-per-parameter finding gives u=
s a concrete limit on how much information models can store, crucial for un=
derstanding privacy risks and designing training datasets. The connection b=
etween capacity, memorization, and double descent provides theoretical grou=
nding for empirical observations that have long puzzled researchers. Perhap=
s most practically, the scaling laws for membership inference suggest that =
current large-scale training practices naturally provide some privacy prote=
ction simply through scale - a finding with significant implications for bo=
th model developers concerned about data leakage and researchers studying m=
odel behavior.

't fully grasp whether they process concepts like humans do. While humans e=
xcel at semantic compression - organizing diverse instances into meaningful=
 categories (like grouping robins and eagles as &quot;birds&quot;) - this p=
rocess involves a delicate balance. We trade off between keeping representa=
tions simple and preserving semantic richness. The fundamental question is:=
 Do LLMs achieve this same balance between compression and meaning that cha=
racterizes human cognition, or do they use fundamentally different strategi=
es?</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

span> The researchers (among them, Yann LeCun) developed a new information-=
theoretic framework combining Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bo=
ttleneck principle to quantitatively measure how both humans and LLMs balan=
ce compression with semantic fidelity. They analyzed token embeddings from =
various LLMs (ranging from BERT to Llama models) and compared them against =
classic human categorization benchmarks from cognitive psychology. Using me=
trics like mutual information and clustering analysis, they assessed concep=
tual alignment, internal semantic structure, and overall representational e=
fficiency between human and AI systems.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=

 are the key findings? </strong><span>The study reveals a fundamental diver=
gence in how LLMs and humans manage information. While LLMs successfully fo=
rm broad categories that align with human judgment, they fail to capture fi=
ne-grained semantic distinctions like item typicality (e.g., recognizing th=
at a robin is a more &quot;typical&quot; bird than a penguin). Most strikin=
gly, LLMs demonstrate aggressive statistical compression - they minimize re=
dundancy and maximize efficiency by information-theoretic measures. In cont=
rast, human conceptual systems appear &quot;inefficient&quot; by these metr=

ing up LLMs will naturally lead to human-like understanding. The stark diff=
erence in representational strategies suggests that current AI architecture=
s may be fundamentally limited in achieving genuine comprehension. While LL=
Ms excel at statistical pattern matching through aggressive compression, hu=
man cognition prioritizes semantic richness and adaptive flexibility - qual=

 crucial for developing next-generation AI systems that move beyond surface=

g>What problem does it solve?</strong><span> Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) =
like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable abilities in complex=
 reasoning tasks, but they suffer from a Goldilocks problem - they either t=
hink too much (overthinking) or too little (underthinking). Think of it lik=
e a student solving a math problem who either gets stuck in unnecessary cal=
culations or rushes through without proper consideration. These models stru=
ggle to find the sweet spot between what psychologists call System 1 (fast,=
 intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking). Current appr=
oaches try to fix this by either forcing more thinking or cutting it short,=
 but these one-size-fits-all solutions aren't optimal for different types o=
f problems.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem? <=
/strong><span>AlphaOne (=CE=B11) acts like a smart reasoning scheduler. The=
 key innovation is the &quot;=CE=B1 moment&quot; - imagine it as a timer th=
at determines how long the model should spend in its thinking phase, scaled=
 by a parameter =CE=B1. Before this moment, =CE=B11 uses a clever probabili=
ty-based system (Bernoulli process) to insert &quot;wait&quot; tokens that =
trigger slower, more careful thinking - like adding strategic pauses in a c=
onversation. After the =CE=B1 moment, it switches gears by replacing any fu=
rther &quot;wait&quot; tokens with end-of-thinking markers, essentially tel=
ling the model &quot;okay, time to wrap up and give your answer.&quot; This=
 creates a natural slow-to-fast reasoning flow, rather than the rigid all-o=
r-nothing approaches used before.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are t=
he key findings? </strong><span>The empirical results across mathematical, =
coding, and scientific benchmarks show that =CE=B11 significantly outperfor=
ms existing methods in both reasoning quality and efficiency. The framework=
 demonstrates superior performance while being more flexible than previous =
approaches - it can handle both sparse adjustments (occasional tweaks) and =
dense modulation (frequent fine-tuning) of the reasoning process. Important=
ly, =CE=B11 successfully balances the trade-off between thinking deeply eno=
ugh to solve complex problems and being efficient enough to be practical, a=
chieving what the authors call &quot;dense slow-to-fast reasoning modulatio=
n.&quot;</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span>=
These findings matter because they provide a practical solution to make AI =
reasoning both smarter and more efficient. As LLMs are increasingly deploye=
d for complex tasks in science, mathematics, and programming, having a fram=
ework that can dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on the problem at h=
and is crucial. =CE=B11's approach is particularly valuable because it's un=
iversal - it can be applied to different models and doesn't require retrain=
ing. This means existing LRMs can be immediately improved, making them more=
 reliable for real-world applications where both accuracy and computational=
 efficiency matter. The work also provides insights into how AI reasoning d=
iffers from human cognition, suggesting that optimal AI reasoning might fol=
low different patterns than human thought processes.</span></p><div style=

/strong><span>The widespread deployment of large language models has raised=
 critical questions about what these models actually memorize from their tr=
aining data. While previous work has tried to measure memorization through =
extraction attacks or membership inference, these approaches fail to distin=
guish between genuine memorization and generalization. For instance, if a m=
odel correctly answers &quot;What is 2^100?&quot;, is it memorizing the spe=
cific answer or generalizing from mathematical patterns? This distinction m=
atters enormously for understanding model capacity, privacy risks, and the =
fundamental nature of how LLMs store and retrieve information.</span></p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem? </strong><span>The author=
s propose a new framework that decomposes memorization into two distinct co=
mponents: unintended memorization (information about specific datasets) and=
 generalization (knowledge about the underlying data-generation process). T=
hey leverage compression theory and Kolmogorov complexity to quantify memor=
ization in bits. To isolate pure memorization from generalization, they fir=
st train models on uniformly random bitstrings where no generalization is p=
ossible. Then they repeat experiments with real text, using larger &quot;or=
acle&quot; models as references to separate sample-specific memorization fr=
om general patterns. This clever approach allows them to measure the exact =
information capacity of transformer models.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>=
What are the key findings? </strong><span>They discovered that GPT-style tr=
ansformers have a remarkably consistent capacity of approximately 3.6 bits-=
per-parameter, regardless of model size. They observed that models memorize=
 training data until reaching this capacity limit, at which point &quot;gro=
kking&quot; occurs - the model shifts from memorizing individual samples to=
 learning generalizable patterns. This transition point coincides exactly w=
ith the double descent phenomenon. Additionally, they developed scaling law=
s that accurately predict membership inference performance based on model c=
apacity and dataset size, showing that modern LLMs trained on massive datas=
ets make reliable membership inference practically impossible for average d=
atapoints.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><spa=
n>These results provide the first principled measurement of language model =
capacity and offer a unified explanation for several puzzling phenomena in =
deep learning. The 3.6 bits-per-parameter finding gives us a concrete limit=
 on how much information models can store, crucial for understanding privac=
y risks and designing training datasets. The connection between capacity, m=
emorization, and double descent provides theoretical grounding for empirica=
l observations that have long puzzled researchers. Perhaps most practically=
, the scaling laws for membership inference suggest that current large-scal=
e training practices naturally provide some privacy protection simply throu=
gh scale - a finding with significant implications for both model developer=
s concerned about data leakage and researchers studying model behavior.</sp=
