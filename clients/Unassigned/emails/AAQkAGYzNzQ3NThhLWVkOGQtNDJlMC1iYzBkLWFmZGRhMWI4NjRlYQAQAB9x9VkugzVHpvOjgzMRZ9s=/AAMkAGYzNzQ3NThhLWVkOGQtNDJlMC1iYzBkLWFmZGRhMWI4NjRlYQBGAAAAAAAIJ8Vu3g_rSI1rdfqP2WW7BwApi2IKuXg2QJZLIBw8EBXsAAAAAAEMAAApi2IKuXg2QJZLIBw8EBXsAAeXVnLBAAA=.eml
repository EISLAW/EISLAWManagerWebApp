Since ChatGPT launched, intelligence has scaled roughly 60,000x, while memo=
ry has scaled only 100x.=20
This means that relative to intelligence, the memory problem has gotten ~2.=
5 orders of magnitude (or 25x) WORSE since ChatGPT launched. Not better. 25=
x worse.=20
This explains why we have invented entire jobs called Context Engineering.=
=20
Why there is a hundred billion dollar industry for memory solution vendors.=
=20
Why so much of prompting is about what you can put into a chat to remember.
Most of all, why everyone I talk to is trying to figure out desperately how=
 to fit transcripts, notes, documents, into some kind of order so they can =
use AI with it.
It=E2=80=99s so hard. And we=E2=80=99re not getting help, and that=E2=80=99=
s why I wrote this piece.
I=E2=80=99m gonna dig in here and explain:
Why memory is such a difficult problem to solve
Including 5 root causes that explain why no vendor has solved memory yet
I have not seen anyone lay these out this clearly before
Frankly, I think a lot of vendors don=E2=80=99t want to talk about them
The key insights you need to understand how to build your own memory soluti=
ons
No coding is not needed!
Yes, I have prompts to help
The 8 scalable principles I use to construct memory systems
Yes, they scale from ChatGPT user level to engineering level
Yes, you can use the same principles to design agentic systems
No coding is needed=E2=80=94but you CAN use these principles to code quickl=
y
Again, I haven=E2=80=99t seen anyone lay these out before like this
Five Prompts to get you started on your own memory solution
An easy start prompt to help you sketch out a system
A Memory Architecture Designer prompt
A Context Library Builder prompt
A Project Brief Compiler prompt
A Retrieval Strategy Planner prompt
I wrote these prompts because I wanted to be helpful and I could find ZERO =
prompts out there to help with designing real memory systems in depth. I th=
ink that=E2=80=99s because the problem is so difficult.=20
So I built them myself, and I=E2=80=99m sharing them here. Dig in, enjoy, a=
nd good luck building a memory system for AI!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Grab the memory prompts now [ https://substack.com/redirect/a8668d3a-7acb-4=
a1a-949f-ae56329aa7c7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6=
RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These prompts convert unstructured conversations into reusable context that=
 improves AI consistency.=20
The Memory Architecture Designer defines what information to store, where t=
o store it, and for how long, ensuring critical facts remain accurate and a=
ccessible.=20
The Context Library Builder captures durable preferences, playbooks, and re=
ference materials, eliminating repeated explanations. The Project Brief Com=
piler transforms scattered inputs into a verified, single source of truth w=
ith explicit scope.=20
The Retrieval Strategy Planner maps which information to surface during pla=
nning, execution, and review phases.=20
Together, these prompts reduce friction, minimize errors, and maintain cont=
inuity across sessions and tools=E2=80=94each conversation starts with bett=
er context and reaches useful output faster.
(The easy start prompt is at the end of the article)
The Real AI Breakthrough Isn=E2=80=99t Reasoning=E2=80=94It=E2=80=99s Memor=
y
Memory is perhaps the biggest unsolved problem in AI, and it=E2=80=99s one =
of the only problems in AI that is getting worse, not better. As we get bet=
ter and better at intelligence, we get worse at memory, relatively speaking=
=2E In fact, there=E2=80=99s a name for it=
 in the model maker community: the=20=
memory wall.
We=E2=80=99re not improving the hardware capabilities of our memory systems=
 nearly as fast as we=E2=80=99re improving the ability of those chips to do=
 inference, to compute, to generate. That creates a growing gap between our=
 intelligence capabilities and our memory capabilities.
Here=E2=80=99s the core tension: AI systems are stateless by design, but us=
eful intelligence requires state.
Every conversation starts from zero. The model has parametric knowledge=E2=
=80=94the weights we talk about=E2=80=94but it doesn=E2=80=99t have episodi=
c memory. It doesn=E2=80=99t remember what happened with you. You have to r=
econstruct your context every single time. This isn=E2=80=99t a bug. It=E2=
=80=99s the architecture. Model makers want the system to be maximally usef=
ul at solving the next problem, and they can=E2=80=99t presume that state m=
atters.
The promise of =E2=80=9Cmemory features=E2=80=9D is that vendors will magic=
ally solve this by making the system stateful in ways that are useful to yo=
u. But this creates a whole host of new problems: What should it remember? =
How long? When do you retrieve it? How do you update it?
These aren=E2=80=99t implementation details. They=E2=80=99re fundamental qu=
estions about what memory is and what it=E2=80=99s for when we do work. The=
 gap between what=E2=80=99s promised, what=E2=80=99s delivered, and what=E2=
=80=99s actually needed has never been bigger.
Why This Matters Now
First, this is getting worse! But behind that, there=E2=80=99s a massive sh=
ift in the competitive landscape happening now.
The competitive shift: Memory is moving from =E2=80=9Cnice to have=E2=80=9D=
 to =E2=80=9Ccore competitive advantage=E2=80=9D faster than most teams rea=
lize. Organizations with intentional memory systems are shipping 2-3x faste=
r=E2=80=94not because their AI is smarter, but because they=E2=80=99ve stop=
ped losing context. Every conversation compounds instead of starting from z=
ero.
What=E2=80=99s actually happening (beyond the hype):
Gemini (Google) now offers million-token context windows and is rumored to =
be building cross-thread memory retrieval into the product. Expect tighter =
integration with Google Workspace memory by Q1 2025.
Claude (Anthropic) added chat history search and optional automatic memory =
for Team/Enterprise tiers. The bet: let users control what persists across =
conversations.
Cursor (for developers) shipped Plan Mode=E2=80=94a separate retrieval mode=
 for architectural thinking vs. execution. They=E2=80=99ve recognized that =
memory needs differ by task type, not just by volume.
The pattern: Every major player is racing to solve memory, but they=E2=80=
=99re solving different slices of it. ChatGPT Memory won=E2=80=99t talk to =
Claude. Cursor=E2=80=99s memory bank is great=E2=80=94until you need to swi=
tch editors. No single vendor has the full solution yet.
And critically, you can=E2=80=99t outsource memory to a vendor, because ven=
dors don=E2=80=99t understand your context well enough to truly solve it (a=
nd why should you turn memory over to one vendor?)
Build vs. buy framework:
Use vendor solutions when:
Your context is general enough to share with the platform
You work solo or in small teams
Lock-in risk is acceptable
Build custom memory infrastructure when:
Context is proprietary and compounds over time (client relationships, domai=
n expertise, system architecture)
You need audit trails and governance (compliance, security)
Retrieval needs are complex (mode-aware, multi-source, high precision on fa=
cts)
The risk equation: Bad memory =3D context drift, hallucinated facts, privac=
y leaks, wasted cycles re-explaining. Good memory =3D compounding leverage,=
 consistent outputs, faster iteration, portable intelligence.
What=E2=80=99s coming: Expect every major AI tool to ship memory features i=
n the next 6 months. The principles below help you evaluate what=E2=80=99s =
real versus vapor, and build systems that work across platforms.
Memory Is Two Acts
Ok, as we move forward, this is the foundation everything else builds on:
Act 1: Building your context library. This is what you want the system to r=
emember=E2=80=94your preferences, your standards, project facts, domain kno=
wledge, past decisions. It=E2=80=99s deliberate curation, not passive accum=
ulation.
Act 2: Pulling the right slice. Retrieval that actually works. Not =E2=80=
=9Cdump everything into the context window,=E2=80=9D but selective, precise=
 fetching of what matters for the current task.
Everything else=E2=80=94embeddings, vector stores, context windows, RAG pip=
elines=E2=80=94is infrastructure supporting these two acts.
The mistake most people make: they focus on infrastructure (bigger context =
windows! better embeddings!) without being intentional about what they=E2=
=80=99re storing or how they=E2=80=99re retrieving it. Result: more context=
, same problems.
The path forward: understand why the problem persists, then apply principle=
s that actually solve it.
The Problem
Fundamentally, AI systems are bad at memory for reasons we don=E2=80=99t us=
ually talk about. I=E2=80=99m laying these out here because I think it is i=
mportant to talk about the real reasons why no one has yet shipped an adequ=
ate memory solve.=20
All six of these are separate root causes, but they are interrelated. Think=
 of them as a big nasty ball of twine=E2=80=94the problem space is extremel=
y entangled, and that=E2=80=99s why it=E2=80=99s hard to solve.
1. The relevance problem is unsolved
What=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Crelevant=E2=80=9D changes based on:
What task you=E2=80=99re doing (planning vs. executing)
What phase of work (exploration vs. refinement)
What scope you=E2=80=99re in (personal vs. project)
What changed since last time (state deltas)
Semantic similarity is a proxy for relevance, not a solution. =E2=80=9CFind=
 similar documents=E2=80=9D works until you need =E2=80=9Cfind the document=
 where we decided X=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cignore everything about Client A r=
ight now, but pay attention to clients B, C, and D.=E2=80=9D
There=E2=80=99s no general algorithm for relevance. It requires human judgm=
ent about task context, which means it requires architecture, not just bett=
er embeddings. That=E2=80=99s why one-stop-shop vendors often struggle with=
 real implementations.
2. The persistence/precision tradeoff
If you store everything, retrieval becomes noisy and expensive. You jam up =
your context window.
If you store selectively, you lose information you=E2=80=99ll need later.
If you let the system decide what to keep, it optimizes for the wrong thing=
=E2=80=94recency, frequency, statistical salience versus actual importance.
Human memory solves this through the technology of forgetting. We use incre=
dibly lossy compression with emotional and importance weighting. AI systems=
 don=E2=80=99t have that. They either accumulate or they purge, but they do=
n=E2=80=99t naturally decay.
Forgetting is a useful technology for us. AI has nothing like it.
3. The single-context-window assumption
Vendors keep trying to solve memory by making context windows bigger. But v=
olume isn=E2=80=99t the issue=E2=80=94structure is.
A million-token context window full of unsorted context is worse than a 10,=
000-token window with precisely curated content. The model still has to fin=
d what matters, parse relevance, ignore noise. You haven=E2=80=99t solved t=
he problem, you=E2=80=99ve made it more expensive.
I know people who don=E2=80=99t budget their API calls and wonder why their=
 bill is high. It=E2=80=99s because they=E2=80=99re stuffing the context wi=
ndow hoping volume solves precision. It doesn=E2=80=99t.
The real solution requires multiple context streams with different lifecycl=
es and retrieval patterns. But that breaks the simple mental model of =E2=
=80=9Cjust talk to the AI.=E2=80=9D
4. The portability problem
Every vendor builds proprietary memory layers because they think memory is =
a moat. ChatGPT Memory, Claude=E2=80=99s recall, Cursor=E2=80=99s memory ba=
nk=E2=80=94none of these are interoperable.
Users invest time building up memory in one system, then switching costs be=
come real. You can=E2=80=99t port =E2=80=9Cwhat ChatGPT knows about me=E2=
=80=9D to Claude. Your memory is locked in.
This discourages users from building proper context libraries because =E2=
=80=9Cthe tool will handle it.=E2=80=9D Then the tool changes, or you switc=
h tools, and you=E2=80=99re starting over.
If you=E2=80=99re building business memory systems, you must solve the port=
ability problem. It=E2=80=99s a liability to be single-model. But vendors a=
ren=E2=80=99t incentivized to make memory truly portable either.
5. The passive accumulation fallacy
Most memory features assume: =E2=80=9CJust use the AI normally, and it will=
 figure out what to remember.=E2=80=9D
This fails because:
The system can=E2=80=99t distinguish preference from fact
It can=E2=80=99t tell project-specific from evergreen context
It can=E2=80=99t know when old information is stale
It optimizes for continuity, not correctness (=E2=80=9Dkeep the conversatio=
n going=E2=80=9D)
Useful memory requires active curation=E2=80=94deciding what to keep, what =
to update, what to discard. That=E2=80=99s work. Vendors promise passive so=
lutions because active curation doesn=E2=80=99t scale as a product.
But passive accumulation doesn=E2=80=99t solve the problem either. And this=
 costs us billions of dollars at the enterprise level while frustrating use=
rs personally and professionally.
6. Memory is actually multiple problems
When people say =E2=80=9CAI memory,=E2=80=9D they=E2=80=99re conflating:
Preferences (how I like things done) =E2=86=92 key-value, persistent
Facts (what=E2=80=99s true about entities) =E2=86=92 structured, needs upda=
tes
Knowledge (domain expertise) =E2=86=92 parametric, embedded in weights
Episodic (what we discussed) =E2=86=92 conversational, temporal, ephemeral
Procedural (how we solved this before) =E2=86=92 exemplars, success traces
Each needs different storage, retrieval, and update patterns. Treating them=
 as one problem guarantees you solve none of them well.
Vendors solve infrastructure, not architecture. Bigger windows, better embe=
ddings, cross-chat search=E2=80=94these are scaling improvements, not struc=
tural solutions.
Users expect passive solutions to active problems. =E2=80=9CJust remember w=
hat matters=E2=80=9D requires judgment about what matters. That can=E2=80=
=99t be fully automated.
Memory requires architecture (deliberate separation, multiple stores, mode-=
aware retrieval), but vendors sell features (passive accumulation, bigger w=
indows, universal search). That=E2=80=99s the gap. That=E2=80=99s why this =
persists.
How to Solve: The 8 Principles
Ok enough of the doom and gloom. How do we move forward here? What scalable=
 principles enable us to unlock this problem?
I=E2=80=99m constructing and laying out these principles so that they work =
whether you=E2=80=99re a power user with ChatGPT or a developer building ag=
entic systems. They=E2=80=99re tool-agnostic, they scale with complexity, a=
nd they solve the actual problem.
1. Memory is an architecture, not a feature
You cannot wait for vendors to solve this. Every tool will have memory capa=
bilities, but they=E2=80=99ll solve different slices. You need principles t=
hat work across all of them.
This means you architect memory as a standalone system that works across yo=
ur whole tool set. Vendors give you capabilities. You design the architectu=
re that makes those capabilities useful to you.
The discipline: treat memory as something you build and maintain, not somet=
hing you passively accumulate through tool usage.
2. Separate by lifecycle, not by convenience
Personal preferences (permanent) =E2=89=A0 project facts (temporary) =E2=89=
=A0 session state (ephemeral).
Mixing these is what breaks memory. Your writing style shouldn=E2=80=99t ch=
ange when you switch projects. Your client=E2=80=99s name shouldn=E2=80=99t=
 bleed into unrelated work.
The discipline lies in keeping these apart cleanly. At a small scale, this =
might be as simple as updating your system prompt separately from project b=
riefs. At larger scale, it=E2=80=99s separate datastores with different ret=
ention policies.
If you=E2=80=99re designing agentic systems, it=E2=80=99s the same principl=
e: separate permanent facts, project-specific facts, and session state. Don=
=E2=80=99t mix lifecycle concerns.
3. Match storage to query pattern
You need multiple stores because different questions require different retr=
ieval:
=E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s my style?=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 key-value
=E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s the exact client ID?=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 structured/=
relational (SQL, tables)
=E2=80=9CWhat similar work have we done?=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 semantic/vector=
 (embeddings)
=E2=80=9CWhat did we try last time?=E2=80=9D =E2=86=92 event logs
Trying to do everything with one storage pattern fails predictably. When yo=
u need an exact client ID, hitting a vector store is slow and unreliable. W=
hen you need =E2=80=9Csimilar past designs,=E2=80=9D a key-value store can=
=E2=80=99t help you.
This is why when people say =E2=80=9Cwe have our data lake and it=E2=80=99s=
 gonna be a RAG,=E2=80=9D I ask: why? RAG works for semantic recall. It doe=
sn=E2=80=99t work for exact lookups, for joining data, for filtering on pre=
cise conditions.
Match the store to the query.
4. Mode-aware context beats volume
More context is not better context.
Planning conversations need breadth=E2=80=94alternatives, comparables, what=
=E2=80=99s worked before. You=E2=80=99re exploring solution space.
Execution conversations need precision=E2=80=94exact constraints, current s=
tatus, no ambiguity.
Review or debugging needs trace history=E2=80=94what did we decide, why, wh=
at did we try that failed.
Retrieval strategy must match task type. Tools like Cursor=E2=80=99s Plan M=
ode recognize this: when you=E2=80=99re planning, it searches broadly acros=
s your codebase and past projects. When you=E2=80=99re executing, it pulls =
precise context for the current file.
You can apply this pattern even without sophisticated tooling: maintain sep=
arate context briefs for planning vs. execution. Your planning brief includ=
es comparables, tradeoffs, open questions. Your execution brief includes on=
ly canonical facts and current constraints.
5. Build portable, not platform-dependent
Your memory layer should survive vendor changes, tool changes, model change=
s. If ChatGPT changes pricing, if Claude adds a feature, your context libra=
ry should be retrievable regardless.
This is something almost nobody can say right now. People doing this well t=
end to be designing large-scale agentic systems at the enterprise level. Bu=
t it=E2=80=99s a best practice for everyone.
It=E2=80=99s like keeping a go bag next to the door. You need something por=
table that carries relevant memory that you can use to have productive conv=
ersations with another AI.
Keep your canonical context library external and model-agnostic. You should=
 be able to copy-paste from this library into ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, what=
ever you=E2=80=99re using. This is your memory, not the tool=E2=80=99s.
Vendor memory is a convenience layer, not your source of truth.
6. Compression is curation
Do not upload 40 pages hoping the AI extracts what matters.
You need to do the compression work. Either in a separate LLM call or in yo=
ur own work: write the brief, identify the key facts that matter, state the=
 constraints. This is where judgment lives.
Memory is bound up in how we humans touch the work. There are ways to use A=
I to amplify and expand your judgment=E2=80=94you can use a precise prompt =
to extract information in a structured way from 40 pages of data, then in s=
eparate work figure out what to do with that data.
But it remains on you to make sure the facts are correct, the constraints a=
re real, and the precision work you=E2=80=99re asking the AI to do with tha=
t data is the correct precision work.
The judgment in compression is human judgment. It may be human judgment you=
 amplify with AI, but it remains human judgment.
7. Retrieval needs verification
Semantic search recalls well but fails on specifics. It will recall topics =
and themes well. But when you need exact IDs, numbers, dates, relationships=
=E2=80=94precision suffers.
You need to pair fuzzy retrieval techniques like RAG with exact verificatio=
n where facts must be correct. Two-stage retrieval: recall candidates, then=
 verify against ground truth.
This is especially important where you have policy, financial facts, or leg=
al facts to validate. There was a prominent fine leveled against a major co=
nsultant firm=E2=80=94close to half a million dollars=E2=80=94because they =
couldn=E2=80=99t verify facts around court cases in a document they prepare=
d. They hallucinated case citations and nobody caught it.
Retrieval failed. And because the LLM is designed to keep the conversation =
going, it just inserted something plausible.
You need to be able to verify retrieval against ground truth. If it=E2=80=
=99s a small task, that might be the human at the other end of the chat. If=
 it=E2=80=99s a large agentic system, you need to do it automatically using=
 an AI agent for evals.
8. Memory compounds through structure
Random accumulation doesn=E2=80=99t compound. It creates noise.
Just adding stuff doesn=E2=80=99t compound. If we just added memories rando=
mly the way we experienced them in life and we had no lossiness, no forgett=
ing ability, we would not be able to function as people.
In the same way that forgetting is a technology for us, structured memory i=
s a technology for LLM systems.
Evergreen context goes one place. Version prompts go another place. Tagged =
exemplars go another place. At small scale, yes, you can do this=E2=80=94pe=
ople are doing it with Obsidian, with Notion, with other systems, as indivi=
duals. And you can scale this as a business. Same principle.
You let each interaction build without degradation if you have structured m=
emory. Otherwise, you have random accumulation. Otherwise, you have the pil=
e of transcripts you never got to and you=E2=80=99re like, =E2=80=9CWell, t=
his is data, we=E2=80=99re logging it, it=E2=80=99s probably good.=E2=80=9D
It=E2=80=99s gonna be random accumulation. It creates noise. You=E2=80=99re=
 not gonna have structured memory that compounds.
Bonus Quick Start Prompt: Design Your Own Memory System
Use this prompt with Claude or ChatGPT to design your memory system. Copy a=
nd paste:
I need to design a memory system for my AI work. Help me think through:

1. What are the different types of context I=E2=80=99m working with?=20
   (Separate by lifecycle: permanent preferences, project facts,=20
   session state)

2. What shape does each type need to be?=20
   (Sharp instructions, structured data, long documents, event logs)

3. Where should each type live?=20
   (Files, key-value stores, tables, embeddings, chat history)

4. How will I retrieve each type?=20
   (Exact match, semantic search, filtered queries, mode-aware)

5. What=E2=80=99s my portability strategy?=20
   (How do I move this memory between tools if needed?)

For each type of context I identify, ask me:
- How often does it change?
- How precisely do I need to retrieve it?
- What breaks if it=E2=80=99s wrong?
- Does it need to survive tool switches?

Then help me sketch a simple implementation plan that starts with=20
the highest-leverage, lowest-effort pieces.

THIS PROMPT IS FOR YOU. ASK ONE QUESTION AT A TIME. RUN NOW.

This prompt applies the 8 principles to your specific situation. It forces =
you to separate by lifecycle, match storage to query pattern, think about p=
ortability, and design for retrieval that works.
The AI will ask clarifying questions. Answer them honestly. The goal isn=E2=
=80=99t a perfect system upfront=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s intentional choices t=
hat compound over time.
Think of this prompt as the quick and easy version of the overall prompt sy=
stem=E2=80=94something to get you started.

TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Start Here This Week
You don=E2=80=99t need to implement everything at once. Pick one move based=
 on where you are:
If you=E2=80=99re just starting: Version three prompts this week. Save them=
 somewhere you can grab them=E2=80=94Notion, Google Docs, a folder. Note wh=
at each one is for. This is Principle 5 (build portable) and Principle 8 (s=
tructure compounds).
If you have prompts but no system: Create a single =E2=80=9CContext Library=
=E2=80=9D page with two sections: Profile & Preferences (permanent), and Wo=
rk Playbooks (evergreen). Write 3-5 bullets in each. Use it in your next th=
ree AI conversations. This is Principle 2 (separate by lifecycle).
If you=E2=80=99re working on a significant project: Write one project brief=
 using this format: goal & audience, canonical facts (IDs, dates, metrics),=
 scope and out-of-scope, prior decisions, deliverable format, acceptance cr=
iteria. Use it instead of uploading raw documents. This is Principle 6 (com=
pression is curation).
If you=E2=80=99re building systems: Add a multi-store layer to your next pr=
oject. Key-value for preferences, SQL for facts, vectors for recall. Keep t=
hem separate and see how retrieval precision improves. This is Principle 3 =
(match storage to query pattern).
If you=E2=80=99re evaluating vendors: Use the 8 principles as a scorecard. =
Ask: Does this tool let me separate by lifecycle? Can I export my memory? H=
ow does retrieval change by task type? Does it support verification of fact=
s?
The pattern: start small, be intentional, compound from there. Memory syste=
ms that work are built incrementally, not architected perfectly upfront.
But they must be built. Passive accumulation doesn=E2=80=99t scale. Active =
curation does.
Remember why this matters: Consistent outputs across conversations and tool=
s. Context that actually persists. Work that compounds instead of starting =
from zero every time.
Memory that works.

2. What shape does each type need to be?=20

3. Where should each type live?=20
   (Files, key-value stores, tables, embeddings, chat history)

4. How will I retrieve each type?=20
   (Exact match, semantic search, filtered queries, mode-aware)

5. What=E2=80=99s my portability strategy?=20
   (How do I move this memory between tools if needed?)

For each type of context I identify, ask me:
- How often does it change?
- How precisely do I need to retrieve it?
- What breaks if it=E2=80=99s wrong?
- Does it need to survive tool switches?

Then help me sketch a simple implementation plan that starts with=20
