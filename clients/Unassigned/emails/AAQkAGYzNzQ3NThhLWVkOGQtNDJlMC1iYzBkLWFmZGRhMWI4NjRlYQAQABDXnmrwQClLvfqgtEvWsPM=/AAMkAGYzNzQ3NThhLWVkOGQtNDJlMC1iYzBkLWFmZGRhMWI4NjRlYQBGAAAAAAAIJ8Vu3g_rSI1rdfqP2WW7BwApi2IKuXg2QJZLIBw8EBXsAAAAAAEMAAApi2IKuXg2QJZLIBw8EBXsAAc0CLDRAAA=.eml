DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS ON TRUMP’S GULF VISIT [3]
THE U.S. SEES THE TOUR AS MUCH MORE TRANSACTIONAL THAN THE GULF STATES DO.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention in March to visit and conclude trade deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. He justified his choice by citing promises of
trillions of dollars in deals that would benefit U.S. companies. Given the trade war he is waging against China and other countries, Trump is focused on achieving immediate gains from his Gulf tour.
He needs to show that deals are flowing to the U.S. as evidence of the success of his policies. However, the leaders of the three Gulf countries he visited last week aspire to become strategic and
long-lasting U.S. allies in defense and regional and international politics, and as such, they want to be recipients of U.S. industrial high-tech. But it’s unlikely that Washington will afford them
that status. Trump does not think highly of the Gulf countries; he wants only to take advantage of their enchantment with the U.S.
CASH COW THEORY
In 2014, Trump posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Saudis are mouthpieces, bullies and cowards who have money but no guts. Trump boasts of funneling Gulf and other countries' money into the U.S
market. In 2016, he described Saudi Arabia as a cash cow, demanding it share its oil wealth with the U.S. in exchange for continued protection. He said that whenever this cow's udder dries up and no
longer produces dollars and gold, we will order its slaughter. Trump views all Gulf countries similarly.
Trump's frequent references to the wealth of the Gulf states reflect his view of them and his rejection of the U.S. defending them for free. Trump bragged that during his first presidential term, he
called Saudi King Salman to demand more protection money. He added that obtaining more than $500 million from the Saudis took him one phone call. In 2019, Trump invited Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al
Thani to dinner in the Treasury Department Cash Room. Trump praised the emir, calling him a great ally of the U.S. He also thanked him for underwriting the $8 billion construction of Al-Udeid Air Base
but demanded more.
Trump even revealed his ambitions for Iraqi oil during his first presidential campaign, complaining that the U.S. had spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and lost thousands of lives without gaining
anything. He noted that in wars, the victor reaps the spoils. Trump repeatedly said that the U.S. should have seized Iraq's oil fields to offset the exorbitant costs of its war. Trump's pursuit of the
no-war, no-peace strategy with Iran keeps the Gulf countries wary about Tehran's intentions and ensures the steady flow of their cash to the U.S.
The cash cow theory is among many drivers of U.S. foreign policy. It is often presented discreetly and wrapped in long-term projects linked to the economic development of U.S. allies in underdeveloped
countries. After the oil boom in the 1970s, for example, the U.S. pressured Saudi Arabia to accelerate economic growth and allocate massive amounts of financial resources to execute mega projects.
Trump's frequent mention of money and his repeated references to the wealth of the Gulf states reflect his materialistic view of them and his belief that they must pay for U.S. protection. An Israeli
analyst commented on Trump's visit to the Gulf, saying that he wants their money and that his interest in the Arabs is limited to their wealth.
WHAT THEY WANT FROM TRUMP
As part of Trump's plan to secure lucrative financial deals from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, he agreed to give them a diplomatic role beyond the Middle East, making them a mediator in talks on ending
the war in Ukraine. In February, Riyadh hosted talks between U.S. and Russian officials on the conflict. In March, Saudi Arabia invited delegations from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine for separate
rounds of talks. The meeting of U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah was the first of its kind since a verbal altercation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House
in late February. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also successfully mediated prisoner exchange deals between Russia and Ukraine.
With Trump's support, Gulf states have gained political and economic influence, thanks to their roles in dealing with regional and global crises, financial capabilities and vast oil and natural gas
reserves. Given the dramatic developments unfolding in the region, Saudi Arabia considered Trump's visit pivotal. Local media described the results as enabling the kingdom to reshape the Middle East
without explaining how.
The frameworks for anticipated cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. include artificial intelligence, technology and energy. The five-year development plans of the 1980s focused, in addition
to completing development infrastructure, on Saudization and technology transfer, but they failed miserably. The White House said the arms agreement with Saudi Arabia includes provision of advanced
military equipment and services from more than a dozen U.S. defense companies. Before the visit, Washington took several positive steps toward Riyadh, including halting the U.S. bombing of Houthi
sites in Yemen and separating civil nuclear cooperation talks from the issue of normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
SYCOPHANCY AND DELUSIONS
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has pledged $600 billion in investments over the next four years, though Trump hopes to strike deals worth nearly $1 trillion. The UAE has pledged a 10-year
investment framework in the U.S. worth $1.4 trillion, while Qatar committed to $1.2 trillion. These financial commitments are staggering: They amount to 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic
product, nearly 300 percent of the UAE’s, and almost 600 percent of Qatar's.
Gulf media, particularly Saudi media, are promoting the notion that Trump is reshaping U.S. policy in the region away from Israel. Saudi news outlets have even gone so far as to say that Riyadh is
reshaping the world. The Gulf states fail to understand that the strained relations between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do not mean a shift in Washington’s view of the
balance of power in the Middle East. The role of the Gulf states does not extend beyond easing global tensions through mediation and shouldering the financial costs associated with them. Qatar thus
serves as a link between Hamas on the one hand and the U.S. and Israel on the other, while Saudi Arabia has volunteered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.
Four years ago, MBS failed to secure a meeting with then-U.S. President Joe Biden, who said he wanted to turn the kingdom into a pariah because MBS ordered the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal
Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. However, Trump lavished praise on him during his visit to Riyadh last week, describing him as a "fantastic man" while ignoring his dismal human rights
record.
Trump expressed admiration for the interior design of the Amiri Diwan in the Qatari capital, Doha, and the luxurious white marble that distinguished the hall that hosted the press conference. He
focused on friendly conversations with MBS and the lavish royal reception in Riyadh. However, when Trump talks about Iran, he shows his respect for the ancient Persian civilization, the intelligence
of the Iranian people and the rationality of its political leadership.
Besides admiring its luxury architecture, Trump praised Qatar for its efforts to calm regional tensions. Attention to architectural details is part of Qatar's strategy to consolidate its image as a
host country capable of receiving foreign leaders in a luxurious protocol setting.
The White House announced that Trump forged huge economic agreements with Qatar worth at least $1.2 trillion. They include commercial deals exceeding $243 billion, including the sale of Boeing
aircraft and engines to Qatar Airways. The announcement stressed that the deals would strengthen U.S. manufacturing and technological leadership, paving the way for a new golden era for the U.S.
economy.
Trump and the Qatari emir signed a statement of intent to strengthen the security partnership between their countries. Potential investments worth $38 billion in the U.S.-operated Al-Udeid Air Base,
air defense and maritime security were included.
Trump said he had concluded the largest arms deal in history with Saudi Arabia, worth $142 billion. However, it is unlikely to be implemented because Congress will vote against selling sophisticated
arms to Saudi Arabia that would upset the regional balance of power. In recent years, Congress voted against providing military hardware to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Morocco despite their close ties
with the U.S.
MBS pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. despite Riyadh's struggle to attract foreign investors to his Vision 2023 plan. The kingdom needs at least $100 billion in annual foreign investments to
complete the first phase of NEOM, the prince’s planned supercity, but it has not been able to attract more than $26 billion annually.
Despite their different foreign policy agendas, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar collectively aspire to be influential states; they want the U.S. to entrust them with ensuring regional peace and
stability. Washington cannot take their aspirations seriously because the Gulf states are tribal and divided. The UAE and Qatar fear Saudi Arabia's constant desire to control their political agendas.
Regardless of who occupies the White House, the U.S. would prefer to wait to resolve the Iran issue before reordering the Middle East.
The coming days will reveal whether the Gulf capitals visited by Trump will succeed in their efforts to ease U.S. regulatory restrictions that hinder foreign investment in sectors vital to America’s
national infrastructure: energy, information and communications technology. That Trump has discarded the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the UAE and dismissed Qatari requests to rename the Persian Gulf
(to the Arabian Gulf) attests to Washington’s reluctance to delegate regional security to the Gulf states.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention in March to visit and conclude trade deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. He justified his choice by citing promises of trillions of dollars in deals that would benefit U.S. companies. Given the trade war he is waging against China and other countries, Trump is focused on achieving immediate gains from his Gulf tour. He needs to show that deals are flowing to the U.S. as evidence of the success of his policies. However, the leaders of the three Gulf countries he visited last week aspire to become strategic and long-lasting U.S. allies in defense and regional and international politics, and as such, they want to be recipients of U.S. industrial high-tech. But it’s unlikely that Washington will afford them that status. Trump does not think highly of the Gulf countries; he wants only to take advantage of their enchantment with the U.S.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Cash Cow Theory</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 2014, Trump posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Saudis are mouthpieces, bullies and cowards who have money but no guts. Trump boasts of funneling Gulf and other countries' money into the U.S market. In 2016, he described Saudi Arabia as a cash cow, demanding it share its oil wealth with the U.S. in exchange for continued protection. He said that whenever this cow's udder dries up and no longer produces dollars and gold, we will order its slaughter. Trump views all Gulf countries similarly.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump's frequent references to the wealth of the Gulf states reflect his view of them and his rejection of the U.S. defending them for free. Trump bragged that during his first presidential term, he called Saudi King Salman to demand more protection money. He added that obtaining more than $500 million from the Saudis took him one phone call. In 2019, Trump invited Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to dinner in the Treasury Department Cash Room. Trump praised the emir, calling him a great ally of the U.S. He also thanked him for underwriting the $8 billion construction of Al-Udeid Air Base but demanded more.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump even revealed his ambitions for Iraqi oil during his first presidential campaign, complaining that the U.S. had spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and lost thousands of lives without gaining anything. He noted that in wars, the victor reaps the spoils. Trump repeatedly said that the U.S. should have seized Iraq's oil fields to offset the exorbitant costs of its war. Trump's pursuit of the no-war, no-peace strategy with Iran keeps the Gulf countries wary about Tehran's intentions and ensures the steady flow of their cash to the U.S.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The cash cow theory is among many drivers of U.S. foreign policy. It is often presented discreetly and wrapped in long-term projects linked to the economic development of U.S. allies in underdeveloped countries. After the oil boom in the 1970s, for example, the U.S. pressured Saudi Arabia to accelerate economic growth and allocate massive amounts of financial resources to execute mega projects. Trump's frequent mention of money and his repeated references to the wealth of the Gulf states reflect his materialistic view of them and his belief that they must pay for U.S. protection. An Israeli analyst commented on Trump's visit to the Gulf, saying that he wants their money and that his interest in the Arabs is limited to their wealth.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>What They Want From Trump</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As part of Trump's plan to secure lucrative financial deals from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, he agreed to give them a diplomatic role beyond the Middle East, making them a mediator in talks on ending the war in Ukraine. In February, Riyadh hosted talks between U.S. and Russian officials on the conflict. In March, Saudi Arabia invited delegations from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine for separate rounds of talks. The meeting of U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah was the first of its kind since a verbal altercation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in late February. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also successfully mediated prisoner exchange deals between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With Trump's support, Gulf states have gained political and economic influence, thanks to their roles in dealing with regional and global crises, financial capabilities and vast oil and natural gas reserves. Given the dramatic developments unfolding in the region, Saudi Arabia considered Trump's visit pivotal. Local media described the results as enabling the kingdom to reshape the Middle East without explaining how.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The frameworks for anticipated cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. include artificial intelligence, technology and energy. The five-year development plans of the 1980s focused, in addition to completing development infrastructure, on Saudization and technology transfer, but they failed miserably. The White House said the arms agreement with Saudi Arabia includes provision of advanced military equipment and services from more than a dozen U.S. defense companies. Before the visit, Washington took several positive steps toward Riyadh, including halting the U.S. bombing of Houthi sites in Yemen and separating civil nuclear cooperation talks from the issue of normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Sycophancy and Delusions</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has pledged $600 billion in investments over the next four years, though Trump hopes to strike deals worth nearly $1 trillion. The UAE has pledged a 10-year investment framework in the U.S. worth $1.4 trillion, while Qatar committed to $1.2 trillion. These financial commitments are staggering: They amount to 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product, nearly 300 percent of the UAE’s, and almost 600 percent of Qatar's.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Gulf media, particularly Saudi media, are promoting the notion that Trump is reshaping U.S. policy in the region away from Israel. Saudi news outlets have even gone so far as to say that Riyadh is reshaping the world. The Gulf states fail to understand that the strained relations between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do not mean a shift in Washington’s view of the balance of power in the Middle East. The role of the Gulf states does not extend beyond easing global tensions through mediation and shouldering the financial costs associated with them. Qatar thus serves as a link between Hamas on the one hand and the U.S. and Israel on the other, while Saudi Arabia has volunteered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Four years ago, MBS failed to secure a meeting with then-U.S. President Joe Biden, who said he wanted to turn the kingdom into a pariah because MBS ordered the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. However, Trump lavished praise on him during his visit to Riyadh last week, describing him as a &quot;fantastic man&quot; while ignoring his dismal human rights record.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump expressed admiration for the interior design of the Amiri Diwan in the Qatari capital, Doha, and the luxurious white marble that distinguished the hall that hosted the press conference. He focused on friendly conversations with MBS and the lavish royal reception in Riyadh. However, when Trump talks about Iran, he shows his respect for the ancient Persian civilization, the intelligence of the Iranian people and the rationality of its political leadership.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Besides admiring its luxury architecture, Trump praised Qatar for its efforts to calm regional tensions. Attention to architectural details is part of Qatar's strategy to consolidate its image as a host country capable of receiving foreign leaders in a luxurious protocol setting.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The White House announced that Trump forged huge economic agreements with Qatar worth at least $1.2 trillion. They include commercial deals exceeding $243 billion, including the sale of Boeing aircraft and engines to Qatar Airways. The announcement stressed that the deals would strengthen U.S. manufacturing and technological leadership, paving the way for a new golden era for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump and the Qatari emir signed a statement of intent to strengthen the security partnership between their countries. Potential investments worth $38 billion in the U.S.-operated Al-Udeid Air Base, air defense and maritime security were included.<br>
Trump said he had concluded the largest arms deal in history with Saudi Arabia, worth $142 billion. However, it is unlikely to be implemented because Congress will vote against selling sophisticated arms to Saudi Arabia that would upset the regional balance of power. In recent years, Congress voted against providing military hardware to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Morocco despite their close ties with the U.S.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">MBS pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. despite Riyadh's struggle to attract foreign investors to his Vision 2023 plan. The kingdom needs at least $100 billion in annual foreign investments to complete the first phase of NEOM, the prince’s planned supercity, but it has not been able to attract more than $26 billion annually.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite their different foreign policy agendas, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar collectively aspire to be influential states; they want the U.S. to entrust them with ensuring regional peace and stability. Washington cannot take their aspirations seriously because the Gulf states are tribal and divided. The UAE and Qatar fear Saudi Arabia's constant desire to control their political agendas. Regardless of who occupies the White House, the U.S. would prefer to wait to resolve the Iran issue before reordering the Middle East.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The coming days will reveal whether the Gulf capitals visited by Trump will succeed in their efforts to ease U.S. regulatory restrictions that hinder foreign investment in sectors vital to America’s national infrastructure: energy, information and communications technology. That Trump has discarded the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the UAE and dismissed Qatari requests to rename the Persian Gulf (to the Arabian Gulf) attests to Washington’s reluctance to delegate regional security to the Gulf states.</p>
