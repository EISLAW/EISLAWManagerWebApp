IGNORING DEFEAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST [3]
REGIONAL LEADERS’ PERSONALISTIC POLITICAL STYLES CANNOT TOLERATE ACCOUNTABILITY.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Since the state of Israel was established in 1948, Arab countries and post-1979 revolution Iran have not acknowledged their defeats, preferring a policy of denial, twisting of facts, and condescension
of their people. Political anthropology sheds light on this phenomenon by drawing on the concept of high-context culture, frequently encountered in collectivist Middle Eastern societies. High-context
culture posits that a person may not mean what they say literally or entirely, and one's reaction rests on understanding and internalizing the context, even if it deviates from reality. The way the
sender transmits their message matters more than the message itself; the speaker's tone of voice, facial expressions, gestures and body language can all be part of the communicated message. Middle
Eastern countries, which are typically collectivist, fall on the right side of the high-context cultural continuum, where paternalistic leadership, social hierarchy, conformism, pride, honor and shame
dominate society. Societal complexity renders it extremely difficult to make concessions, admit reality and form an independent worldview.
SHIITE NARRATIVE
Accordingly, Iran has crafted a narrative that omits inconvenient truths about its successes and failures in the conflict with Israel. After the ceasefire agreement with Israel last November,
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem said his party had achieved a convincing victory against Israel, surpassing the achievement in the 2006 war, which former Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah had
described as a divine victory. Qassem celebrated the victory because Israel was unable to eliminate Hezbollah or achieve any of its goals despite Western support. According to Qassem, Hezbollah's
resistance forced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire. Shortly after the 2006 war, some Hezbollah fighters claimed to have seen the Mahdi striking Israeli tanks with a
heavy stick. (The Mahdi is the 12th Shiite imam who went into occultation in 941 and whose return, at an unspecified date, is believed to redeem humanity.) Following heavy losses by Hezbollah last
year, others asserted that divine intervention toward the end of the war prevented Israel from achieving all its objectives.
When Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire on June 24, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian congratulated his nation on the great victory against Israel. Its resistance, he said, was nothing short of
heroic. Iran's National Security Council even claimed the Islamic Republic had achieved strategic superiority in the battle with Israel, forcing it to repent, admit defeat and unilaterally cease
hostilities. A state-run television broadcaster falsely claimed that the missile operations by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, particularly those against America’s Al Udeid air base in Qatar,
prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call for the ceasefire. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed to have defeated Israel and the U.S., noting that Iranian nuclear sites were still
operational and stressing that he would order more attacks on U.S. military bases if Washington ever struck Iran again. Khamenei repeated his claim that the U.S. entered the war because it believed
that if it did not, Iran would destroy Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said at the funeral of IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists that Iranians sacrificed their blood, not their
honor, during the 12-day war with Israel. He, too, emphasized that his country had not surrendered.
PREVIOUS WARS
Certain Arab countries share similar delusions. Egypt, for example, blamed its defeat in the 1948 war on corrupt politicians who had allegedly purchased defective field artillery that exploded and
killed its firing crews instead of hitting their targets. The officers who overthrew King Farouk in 1952 promoted this narrative even though Tharwat Okasha, the Egyptian army's deputy chief of staff
in 1948, denied as much. Saad el-Shazly, the Egyptian army's chief of staff during the 1973 war, promoted the same interpretation of events. Even so, the issue of faulty weapons continues to dominate
the collective consciousness of Egyptians even today.
In 1967, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser gave Israel a pretext to wage war after he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Even though Nasser did not want war, he sought to stage a
military demonstration to draw the attention of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, with whom he had a strained relationship. Although that war led to Israel's occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza, the
West Bank and the Golan Heights, Nasser described it as a setback, not a defeat. He said the Egyptian military command knew that Israel would initiate the war by attacking Egyptian air force bases,
expecting the air raids to come from the east – that is, Israeli territory. However, the planes struck from the west, from U.S. air base Wheelus in Libya. Israel intercepted a phone call from Nasser
to Syrian President Noureddin al-Atassi to convince him to issue a statement attributing the destruction of Arab air forces to direct Western military intervention.
The systematic propaganda of the Egyptian government, from President Anwar Sadat to President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has convinced the Egyptian people of victory in the 1973 October War that shattered
the myth of the Israeli army's invincibility. In the initial phase, Israel suffered a setback after the Egyptian army stormed the Suez Canal and destroyed the Bar Lev Line on the east bank. However,
the Israeli military was able to penetrate Egyptian defense lines in the east, cross to the west bank of the canal and besiege the Egyptian Third Army in the southern sector of Sinai. The Israelis may
well have encircled the Second Army in northern Sinai had U.S. President Richard Nixon not ordered Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to agree to a ceasefire. Egyptian media continues to describe Sadat
as the hero of the Suez Canal crossing.
A few years later, Iran and Iraq both claimed victory in the First Gulf War, more commonly known in the West as the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Iraq referred to the conflict as "Saddam's Qadisiyyah," a
reference to the Battle of Qadisiyyah in 636, which enabled the Arabs to conquer Persia, while Iran referred to it as the "Sacred Defense." The truth is that neither side emerged victorious. The war
left 1 million dead and inflicted more than $400 billion in damage, equivalent to $1.5 trillion today. In August 1990, the Iraqi army occupied Kuwait, even though it should have known that the U.S.
would not accept any infringement on Gulf oil or any change in the map of the Middle East. Although Saddam Hussein called the war to liberate Kuwait "the mother of all battles," it ended in a crushing
defeat for the Iraqi army, the imposition of severe sanctions, and the subsequent invasion of Iraq in 2003, removing Iraq as a regional power and turning it into an arena for international and
regional intervention.
IMPLICATIONS
Hezbollah's defeat in Lebanon was a resounding Iranian failure that contributed to regime change in Syria, followed by an Israeli air campaign to destroy Iran's nuclear program. Iran must accept
defeat to pave the way for the emergence of a rational state, just as Germany and Japan did after World War II. It has become clear that the ideological doctrine upon which the Islamic Republic of
Iran is based, including the doctrine of exporting the revolution, has been defeated, its regional influence shattered. The repercussions of its military defeat will irreversibly escalate until a more
rational regime comes to power. The Revolutionary Guards, which consider Iran's interference in regional affairs a prerequisite for the Mahdi's appearance, place the local secularists and liberals on
the side of the American enemy – that is, the coalition of unbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy. The defeat of the Islamic Republic's project in neighboring countries puts Iran on the brink of civil
war because the Middle East is changing in a way that prevents the Mahdi's appearance. Pezeshkian finally acknowledged the internal danger looming over Iran and said that his priority was to preserve
the country's unity.
Many of the region's Arab leaders live in a state of detachment from reality, imagining or convincing themselves of illusory victories. Their stereotypical thinking recurs in every battle they wage.
They dig tunnels, stockpile weapons and incite their supporters, promising them a clear victory – only to fall prey to a surprise attack before calling for a ceasefire.
Hamas believed the Oct. 7 attack would lead to Israel's destruction. It expected Hezbollah to invade Israel from the north and the West Bank to rise up in revolt. If Hamas had understood the
implications of its suicidal attack, there would not have been Palestinian deaths, and Gazans would not have faced displacement. The disastrous consequences were clear to anyone who cared to see. If
Hezbollah had admitted its failure from the first day of the pager bombings, Lebanon would have avoided the devastation and tragedies that befell it later. The reality is that the consequences of
defeat are less painful for leaders than admitting defeat.
The problem is not defeat itself but that most Middle Eastern leaders cannot accept failure because their personalistic political systems do not tolerate accountability. They do not understand that
the end of life is not defeat but rather the failure to acknowledge it. The illusion of defeat as victory is a chronic condition. Failure to recognize defeat and the perception of defeat as victory is
a psychological, mental and intellectual defect of certain leaders. Following the Six-Day War, eminent Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani wrote a poem in which he condemned the Arab way of thinking that
contributed to the defeat. He said in one verse: "If we lose the war, it is no surprise because we enter it with the talents of rhetoric."

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Since the state of=
 Israel was established in 1948, Arab countries and post-1979 revolution Ir=
an have not acknowledged their defeats, preferring a policy of denial, twis=
ting of facts, and condescension of their people. Political anthropology sh=
eds light on this phenomenon by drawing on the concept of high-context cult=
ure, frequently encountered in collectivist Middle Eastern societies. High-=
context culture posits that a person may not mean what they say literally o=
r entirely, and one's reaction rests on understanding and internalizing the=
 context, even if it deviates from reality. The way the sender transmits th=
eir message matters more than the message itself; the speaker's tone of voi=
ce, facial expressions, gestures and body language can all be part of the c=
ommunicated message. Middle Eastern countries, which are typically collecti=
vist, fall on the right side of the high-context cultural continuum, where =
paternalistic leadership, social hierarchy, conformism, pride, honor and sh=
ame dominate society. Societal complexity renders it extremely difficult to=
 make concessions, admit reality and form an independent worldview.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Accordingly, Iran =
has crafted a narrative that omits inconvenient truths about its successes =
and failures in the conflict with Israel. After the ceasefire agreement wit=
h Israel last November, Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem said his pa=
rty had achieved a convincing victory against Israel, surpassing the achiev=
ement in the 2006 war, which former Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah had =
described as a divine victory. Qassem celebrated the victory because Israel=
 was unable to eliminate Hezbollah or achieve any of its goals despite West=
ern support. According to Qassem, Hezbollah's resistance forced Israeli Pri=
me Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire. Shortly after the 2=
006 war, some Hezbollah fighters claimed to have seen the Mahdi striking Is=
raeli tanks with a heavy stick. (The Mahdi is the 12th Shiite imam who went=
 into occultation in 941 and whose return, at an unspecified date, is belie=
ved to redeem humanity.) Following heavy losses by Hezbollah last year, oth=
ers asserted that divine intervention toward the end of the war prevented I=
srael from achieving all its objectives.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">When Iran and Isra=
el agreed to a ceasefire on June 24, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian co=
ngratulated his nation on the great victory against Israel. Its resistance,=
 he said, was nothing short of heroic. Iran's National Security Council eve=
n claimed the Islamic Republic had achieved strategic superiority in the ba=
ttle with Israel, forcing it to repent, admit defeat and unilaterally cease=
 hostilities. A state-run television broadcaster falsely claimed that the m=
issile operations by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, particularly th=
ose against America=E2=80=99s Al Udeid air base in Qatar, prompted U.S. Pre=
sident Donald Trump to call for the ceasefire. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali=
 Khamenei claimed to have defeated Israel and the U.S., noting that Iranian=
 nuclear sites were still operational and stressing that he would order mor=
e attacks on U.S. military bases if Washington ever struck Iran again. Kham=
enei repeated his claim that the U.S. entered the war because it believed t=
hat if it did not, Iran would destroy Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abba=
s Araghchi said at the funeral of IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists th=
at Iranians sacrificed their blood, not their honor, during the 12-day war =
with Israel. He, too, emphasized that his country had not surrendered.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Previous W=
ars</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Certain Arab count=
ries share similar delusions. Egypt, for example, blamed its defeat in the =
1948 war on corrupt politicians who had allegedly purchased defective field=
 artillery that exploded and killed its firing crews instead of hitting the=
ir targets. The officers who overthrew King Farouk in 1952 promoted this na=
rrative even though Tharwat Okasha, the Egyptian army's deputy chief of sta=
ff in 1948, denied as much. Saad el-Shazly, the Egyptian army's chief of st=
aff during the 1973 war, promoted the same interpretation of events. Even s=
o, the issue of faulty weapons continues to dominate the collective conscio=
usness of Egyptians even today.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 1967, Egyptian =
President Gamal Abdel Nasser gave Israel a pretext to wage war after he clo=
sed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Even though Nasser did not wa=
nt war, he sought to stage a military demonstration to draw the attention o=
f U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, with whom he had a strained relationship. =
Although that war led to Israel's occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza, =
the West Bank and the Golan Heights, Nasser described it as a setback, not =
a defeat. He said the Egyptian military command knew that Israel would init=
iate the war by attacking Egyptian air force bases, expecting the air raids=
 to come from the east =E2=80=93 that is, Israeli territory. However, the p=
lanes struck from the west, from U.S. air base Wheelus in Libya. Israel int=
ercepted a phone call from Nasser to Syrian President Noureddin al-Atassi t=
o convince him to issue a statement attributing the destruction of Arab air=
 forces to direct Western military intervention.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The systematic pro=
paganda of the Egyptian government, from President Anwar Sadat to President=
 Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has convinced the Egyptian people of victory in the=
 1973 October War that shattered the myth of the Israeli army's invincibili=
ty. In the initial phase, Israel suffered a setback after the Egyptian army=
 stormed the Suez Canal and destroyed the Bar Lev Line on the east bank. Ho=
wever, the Israeli military was able to penetrate Egyptian defense lines in=
 the east, cross to the west bank of the canal and besiege the Egyptian Thi=
rd Army in the southern sector of Sinai. The Israelis may well have encircl=
ed the Second Army in northern Sinai had U.S. President Richard Nixon not o=
rdered Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to agree to a ceasefire. Egyptian =
media continues to describe Sadat as the hero of the Suez Canal crossing.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A few years later,=
 Iran and Iraq both claimed victory in the First Gulf War, more commonly kn=
own in the West as the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Iraq referred to the conf=
lict as &quot;Saddam's Qadisiyyah,&quot; a reference to the Battle of Qadis=
iyyah in 636, which enabled the Arabs to conquer Persia, while Iran referre=
d to it as the &quot;Sacred Defense.&quot; The truth is that neither side e=
merged victorious. The war left 1 million dead and inflicted more than $400=
 billion in damage, equivalent to $1.5 trillion today. In August 1990, the =
Iraqi army occupied Kuwait, even though it should have known that the U.S. =
would not accept any infringement on Gulf oil or any change in the map of t=
he Middle East. Although Saddam Hussein called the war to liberate Kuwait &=
quot;the mother of all battles,&quot; it ended in a crushing defeat for the=
 Iraqi army, the imposition of severe sanctions, and the subsequent invasio=
n of Iraq in 2003, removing Iraq as a regional power and turning it into an=
 arena for international and regional intervention.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Implicatio=
ns</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah's defeat=
 in Lebanon was a resounding Iranian failure that contributed to regime cha=
nge in Syria, followed by an Israeli air campaign to destroy Iran's nuclear=
 program. Iran must accept defeat to pave the way for the emergence of a ra=
tional state, just as Germany and Japan did after World War II. It has beco=
me clear that the ideological doctrine upon which the Islamic Republic of I=
ran is based, including the doctrine of exporting the revolution, has been =
defeated, its regional influence shattered. The repercussions of its milita=
ry defeat will irreversibly escalate until a more rational regime comes to =
power. The Revolutionary Guards, which consider Iran's interference in regi=
onal affairs a prerequisite for the Mahdi's appearance, place the local sec=
ularists and liberals on the side of the American enemy =E2=80=93 that is, =
the coalition of unbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy. The defeat of the Isla=
mic Republic's project in neighboring countries puts Iran on the brink of c=
ivil war because the Middle East is changing in a way that prevents the Mah=
di's appearance. Pezeshkian finally acknowledged the internal danger loomin=
g over Iran and said that his priority was to preserve the country's unity.=
</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Many of the region=
's Arab leaders live in a state of detachment from reality, imagining or co=
nvincing themselves of illusory victories. Their stereotypical thinking rec=
urs in every battle they wage. They dig tunnels, stockpile weapons and inci=
te their supporters, promising them a clear victory =E2=80=93 only to fall =
prey to a surprise attack before calling for a ceasefire.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hamas believed the=
 Oct. 7 attack would lead to Israel's destruction. It expected Hezbollah to=
 invade Israel from the north and the West Bank to rise up in revolt. If Ha=
mas had understood the implications of its suicidal attack, there would not=
 have been Palestinian deaths, and Gazans would not have faced displacement=
. The disastrous consequences were clear to anyone who cared to see. If Hez=
bollah had admitted its failure from the first day of the pager bombings, L=
ebanon would have avoided the devastation and tragedies that befell it late=
r. The reality is that the consequences of defeat are less painful for lead=
ers than admitting defeat.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The problem is not=
 defeat itself but that most Middle Eastern leaders cannot accept failure b=
ecause their personalistic political systems do not tolerate accountability=
. They do not understand that the end of life is not defeat but rather the =
failure to acknowledge it. The illusion of defeat as victory is a chronic c=
ondition. Failure to recognize defeat and the perception of defeat as victo=
ry is a psychological, mental and intellectual defect of certain leaders. F=
ollowing the Six-Day War, eminent Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani wrote a poem in=
 which he condemned the Arab way of thinking that contributed to the defeat=
. He said in one verse: &quot;If we lose the war, it is no surprise because=
 we enter it with the talents of rhetoric.&quot;</p>
