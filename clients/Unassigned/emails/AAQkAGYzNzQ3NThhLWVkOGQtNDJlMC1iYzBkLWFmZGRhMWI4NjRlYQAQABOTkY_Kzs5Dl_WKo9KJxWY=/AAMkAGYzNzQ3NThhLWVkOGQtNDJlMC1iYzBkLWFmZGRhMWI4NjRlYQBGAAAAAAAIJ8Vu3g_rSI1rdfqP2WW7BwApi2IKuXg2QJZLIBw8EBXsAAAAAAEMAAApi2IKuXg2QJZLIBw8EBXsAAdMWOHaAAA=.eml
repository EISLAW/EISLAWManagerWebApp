June 23=2C 2025

Question: Hasn=E2=80=99t the U.S. technically been at war with Iran since=
 1979 (embassy invasion=2C hostages=2C etc.)? What about the War Powers Re=
solution of 1973=2C especially since it seems to hit the middle ground you=
 say is needed? Why not include that in your discussion?

Response:
The problem with the War Powers Resolution is that it violates the constit=
utional mandate that Congress must pass a declaration of war before war ca=
n be waged. The Constitution makes no mention of another way the U.S. migh=
t go to war=2C nor does it define war=2C so we must take it that the frame=
rs were speaking of war as it is commonly understood: armed conflict betwe=
en nations. By allowing military engagement without a formal declaration=
=2C the War Powers Resolution bypasses this constitutional requirement. Th=
is may be more practical in modern times=2C but Congress cannot legislate=
 around a constitutional imperative. We do not want Congress passing laws=
 contrary to the Constitution=2C such as laws limiting free speech.

I think that the virtue of the declaration of war is that it is a sober an=
nouncement that the nation is at war and that now our lives must take this=
 into account. When a nation goes to war=2C it should galvanize the public=
 and not ooze into it. We have gone into many wars and called them police=
 actions=2C counterinsurgencies=2C peacekeeping and whatnot=2C without pub=
lic acknowledgement that the nation is at war and without presidents and m=
embers of Congress taking full responsibility for their decision. Too many=
 soldiers have died without the sober and public recognition of the nature=
 of what is happening. So for me=2C if the War Powers Resolution is necess=
ary=2C it should be enacted through a constitutional amendment and not as=
 a workaround. Of course=2C that is a complex and painful process and won=
=E2=80=99t happen.
Question: Do you see a fundamental issue regarding the role of special int=
erest lobbying and its ability to shape U.S. foreign policy? The Israeli l=
obby is strong in D.C.=2C and the attack on Iran went against the U.S. int=
erest of pulling out of the Middle East. Also=2C what about the scenario o=
f a president exploiting his war declarations to grow his power. Arguably=
 you can=E2=80=99t rule out power grabs=2C especially by people who have d=
edicated their careers to amassing influence=2C no?

Response:

American political life is constructed so that people can govern. All peop=
le have special interests=2C and frequently those interests do not coincid=
e. So treating the concept of special interests as somehow corrupt seems t=
o me to violate the foundations of democracy. Before both world wars there=
 were claims that special interests were causing us to go to war. Prior to=
 both wars there was an argument that we were siding with the British only=
 because white=2C Anglo-Saxon Protestants wanted to protect the nation the=
y came from. In a democracy=2C all wars are shaped by the passions of the=
 people=2C and the charge by the isolationists was that we had no business=
 giving lend-lease to Britain and thereby bringing us closer to war with G=
ermany=2C a war in which the U.S. had no interest. So special interests ab=
ound in a healthy democracy=2C and there are those who favor war for their=
 favored nation=2C frequently the one their past identifies with. The Germ=
an American Bund fought to keep the U.S. out of the
European war. So it goes. In a nation of immigrants this is not unusual. W=
e are a nation of special interests.

Presidents=2C under the Constitution=2C do not declare war; Congress does.=
 The president is commander of the armed forces and fights the war militar=
ily. Presidents in time of war have dramatically increased power over the=
 economy=2C censorship and other things having to do with war. This is why=
 the Constitution does not give the president the authority to start wars.=
 But given that the president is the only one to have been elected by the=
 people as a whole=2C it is appropriate that he have appropriate power in=
 war. He is the trusted representative of the majority of the people=2C th=
rough the Electoral College. One of the problems is that all presidents ar=
e despised by a large group of citizens. This is why it is urgent that the=
 public recognize that any president=2C however much they despise him=2C w=
as democratically elected=2C and to maintain opposition but to not try to=
 delegitimize him.

This is most true in wartime. The Roosevelt haters were many=2C accusing h=
im of being a dictator. When Congress declared war=2C reflecting the publi=
c wishes=2C that hatred didn=E2=80=99t die=2C but it was less apparent bec=
ause of the state of war. In the Vietnam War=2C undeclared by Congress=2C=
 hatred of LBJ was not constrained by congressional action. But then I don=
=E2=80=99t know if Congress would have been willing to declare war on Viet=
nam. It was Congress that failed to block JFK by refusing to fund the war=
 unless there were a congressional declaration of war. So there are ways f=
or Congress to limit wars if they wish. Actually=2C the Supreme Court coul=
d have blocked him too=2C save that the legal system had failed long befor=
e to block war without a declaration. Yes=2C this is a mess=2C and no=2C I=
 don=E2=80=99t know how to untangle it. Nor do others think it is a proble=
m. So we live with it.
Comment/Question: What role do you think Congress should play (if any) in=
 the decision by a president to go to war? Without congressional approval=
=2C the will of the people is not clearly reflected. Notably=2C the courts=
 have stayed away from deciding the legality of the use of force =E2=80=93=
except for the ruling during the Korean War in 1952=2C when President Harr=
y Truman ordered the seizure of most of the nation=E2=80=99s steel mills t=
o stop labor strikes from shutting down mills that were critical to the na=
tion=E2=80=99s security and war efforts and the Supreme Court ruled it unc=
onstitutional.

Response: I deeply believe that the president should not have the power to=
 go to war without the nation=2C as represented by Congress=2C having the=
 final say. The Vietnam War began with Kennedy sending =E2=80=9Cadvisers=
=E2=80=9D to Vietnam who necessarily engaged in combat. LBJ dramatically i=
ncreased it. The war was unwise and its initiation written off as minor. T=
he war tore the nation apart=2C and we failed=2C costing us 50=2C000 dead.=
 If we recognized that in fact we were engaging in war and put it before C=
ongress and the American people=2C we might have gone there anyway=2C but=
 then the American people would have made the decision and=2C holding ours=
elves responsible=2C as the war grew our rage over it would have been miti=
gated if not eliminated. We must go to war rarely and then with the consen=
t of the governed=2C so the governed carry the responsibility and cost of=
 war. But then again=2C in this age=2C how do we do this?
Comment: There are dangers of a serious call for a constitutional conventi=
on. There are no guarantees for retaining any of the current document=2C n=
o restrictions on what new elements could be introduced=2C and the divided=
 American public may not be able to withstand such a controversial process=
=2E Thoughts?

Response: I agree that a constitutional convention would be a mistake. I p=
ointed to it only to make it clear that we must urgently reconsider how we=
 go to war and that something dramatic must be done=2C but God only knows=
 what emerge from such a convention. At the same time=2C my serious point=
 is that Congress and the president should amend the constitutional clause=
 on war to recognize the changes that have taken place in technology and s=
uch=2C and to make certain that Congress and the American people take resp=
onsibility for going to war. It would make it much harder to engage in war=
s=2C and the world should know from that amendment that the Yanks will com=
e only with the support of the nation. I do not ever want to see another w=
ar like Vietnam=2C where the soldiers are drawn from those who didn=E2=80=
=99t have college deferments or minor defects like bone spurs. I am emphat=
ically and overtly not a pacifist=2C but I want my country to know when it=
 is going to war and take responsibility for winning it.
Comment/Question: Could it be possible that the Iranians wanted their nucl=
ear sites to be destroyed? They weren't secret anymore. It would allow the=
m to save face with their own people=2C whereas if they gave everything up=
 in a peace deal that would be seen as a huge sign of weakness within thei=
r culture. They could ask for sanctions relief =E2=80=93 since the only ob=
stacle to that was their nuclear program =E2=80=93 which would greatly imp=
rove the economy and the regime=E2=80=99s chance of survival. They might b=
e able to move their program to another=2C far more secretive location=2C=
 with the U.S. thinking that it had destroyed the threat. And they could s=
eparate from their proxies=2C since the majority of them were destroyed an=
yway.

Response: I do not think that the Iranians wanted their nuclear facilities=
 destroyed. I don=E2=80=99t think the public would have thought better of=
 them having spent the resources to build a weapon and then standing by he=
lplessly as the facilities are destroyed. The reason that Iran was buildin=
g nuclear weapons was not necessarily to use them=2C but to frighten other=
 countries and show their citizens that they were now a great power. There=
 are many subtleties to politics and geopolitics=2C but showing vulnerabil=
ity and weakness to its citizens and the world rarely benefits a regime. T=
he motive for starting to build nuclear weapons was national power and pri=
de. Being so weak that they couldn=E2=80=99t defend the weapons and couldn=
=E2=80=99t frighten their enemies off was not=2C in my mind=2C good politi=
cs =E2=80=93 particularly after Mossad penetrated their country and target=
ed their leaders. So this idea is too subtle for me to grasp.
Comment/Question: Do you think China wouldn=E2=80=99t eventually try to bl=
ockade Taiwan rather than launch a traditional seaborne invasion?

Response: The precedent for this was the Soviet blockade of West Berlin in=
 1948-49. The U.S. response was a massive airlift to West Berlin that main=
tained a reasonable life for its inhabitants. The Russians had the option=
 of shooting down U.S. aircraft. They didn't because that would start a wa=
r with the United States. They did not invade West Germany because they we=
re afraid of war. They tried a blockade because it might work and didn't i=
nvolve automatic war.

So in the case of Taiwan=2C the likely U.S. response would look something=
 like the Berlin blockade=2C with a massive airlift from bases in Japan=2C=
 South Korea and the Philippines and with huge shipments of supplies by sh=
ip to these airfields. There is a second option =E2=80=93 a U.S. ship=2C e=
ither a warship or a transport=2C passing between blockading ships (a bow-=
to-stern line of ships being impractical given the size of the blockade).=
 The Chinese would then have the option of striking the U.S. vessel or let=
ting it pass. The thing to bear in mind is that a blockade is what you do=
 when you do not want a war. So shooting down a plane or sinking a ship wo=
uld lead to war=2C started by China. If China wanted to start a war=2C the=
y would invade Taiwan. So the model of West Berlin=2C the airlift=2C is th=
e likely one. It lasted months=2C but a demonstration of extreme patience=
 by the United States=2C plus the fear of accidentally shooting down a pla=
ne=2C caused Stalin to give up. I do not think the U.S. would initiate war=
fare=2C
but it would undermine the blockade =E2=80=93 causing it to fail to starve=
 out Taiwan =E2=80=93 and with U.S. patience demonstrated=2C China would g=
ive up. Best guess.

<br>
<strong>Response: </strong></p>

<div>The problem with the War Powers Resolution is that it violates the con=
stitutional mandate that Congress must pass a declaration of war before war=
 can be waged. The Constitution makes no mention of another way the U.S. mi=
ght go to war, nor does it define war, so we must take it that the framers =
were speaking of war as it is commonly understood: armed conflict between n=
ations. By allowing military engagement without a formal declaration, the W=
ar Powers Resolution bypasses this constitutional requirement. This may be =
more practical in modern times, but Congress cannot legislate around a cons=
titutional imperative. We do not want Congress passing laws contrary to the=
 Constitution, such as laws limiting free speech.<br>
<br>
I think that the virtue of the declaration of war is that it is a sober ann=
ouncement that the nation is at war and that now our lives must take this i=
nto account. When a nation goes to war, it should galvanize the public and =
not ooze into it. We have gone into many wars and called them police action=
s, counterinsurgencies, peacekeeping and whatnot, without public acknowledg=
ement that the nation is at war and without presidents and members of Congr=
ess taking full responsibility for their decision. Too many soldiers have d=
ied without the sober and public recognition of the nature of what is happe=
ning. So for me, if the War Powers Resolution is necessary, it should be en=
acted through a constitutional amendment and not as a workaround. Of course=
, that is a complex and painful process and won=E2=80=99t happen.</div>

                            <strong>Question: </strong><em>Do you see a fun=
damental issue regarding the role of special interest lobbying and its abil=
ity to shape U.S. foreign policy? The Israeli lobby is strong in D.C., and =
the attack on Iran went against the U.S. interest of pulling out of the Mid=
dle East. Also</em><em>, what about the scenario of a president exploiting =
his war declarations to grow his power. Arguably you can=E2=80=99t rule out=
 power grabs, especially by people who have dedicated their careers to amas=
sing influence, no?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
American political life is constructed so that people can govern. All peopl=
e have special interests, and frequently those interests do not coincide. S=
o treating the concept of special interests as somehow corrupt seems to me =
to violate the foundations of democracy. Before both world wars there were =
claims that special interests were causing us to go to war. Prior to both w=
ars there was an argument that we were siding with the British only because=
 white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants wanted to protect the nation they came from=
. In a democracy, all wars are shaped by the passions of the people, and th=
e charge by the isolationists was that we had no business giving lend-lease=
 to Britain and thereby bringing us closer to war with Germany, a war in wh=
ich the U.S. had no interest. So special interests abound in a healthy demo=
cracy, and there are those who favor war for their favored nation, frequent=
ly the one their past identifies with. The German American Bund fought to k=
eep the U.S. out of the European war. So it goes. In a nation of immigrants=
 this is not unusual. We are a nation of special interests.<br>
<br>
Presidents, under the Constitution, do not declare war; Congress does. The =
president is commander of the armed forces and fights the war militarily. P=
residents in time of war have dramatically increased power over the economy=
, censorship and other things having to do with war. This is why the Consti=
tution does not give the president the authority to start wars. But given t=
hat the president is the only one to have been elected by the people as a w=
hole, it is appropriate that he have appropriate power in war. He is the tr=
usted representative of the majority of the people, through the Electoral C=
ollege. One of the problems is that all presidents are despised by a large =
group of citizens. This is why it is urgent that the public recognize that =
any president, however much they despise him, was democratically elected, a=
nd to maintain opposition but to not try to delegitimize him.<br>
<br>
This is most true in wartime. The Roosevelt haters were many, accusing him =
of being a dictator. When Congress declared war, reflecting the public wish=
es, that hatred didn=E2=80=99t die, but it was less apparent because of the=
 state of war. In the Vietnam War, undeclared by Congress, hatred of LBJ wa=
s not constrained by congressional action. But then I don=E2=80=99t know if=
 Congress would have been willing to declare war on Vietnam. It was Congres=
s that failed to block JFK by refusing to fund the war unless there were a =
congressional declaration of war. So there are ways for Congress to limit w=
ars if they wish. Actually, the Supreme Court could have blocked him too, s=
ave that the legal system had failed long before to block war without a dec=
laration. Yes, this is a mess, and no, I don=E2=80=99t know how to untangle=
 it. Nor do others think it is a problem. So we live with it.

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Wha=
t role do you think Congress should play (if any) in the decision by a pres=
ident to go to war? Without congressional approval, the will of the people =
is not clearly reflected. Notably, the courts have stayed away from decidin=
g the legality of the use of force =E2=80=93except for the ruling during th=
e Korean War in 1952, when President Harry Truman ordered the seizure of mo=
st of the nation=E2=80=99s steel mills to stop labor strikes from shutting =
down mills that were critical to the nation=E2=80=99s security and war effo=
rts and the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>I deeply believe that the president should =
not have the power to go to war without the nation, as represented by Congr=
ess, having the final say. The Vietnam War began with Kennedy sending =E2=
=80=9Cadvisers=E2=80=9D to Vietnam who necessarily engaged in combat. LBJ d=
ramatically increased it. The war was unwise and its initiation written off=
 as minor. The war tore the nation apart, and we failed, costing us 50,000 =
dead. If we recognized that in fact we were engaging in war and put it befo=
re Congress and the American people, we might have gone there anyway, but t=
hen the American people would have made the decision and, holding ourselves=
 responsible, as the war grew our rage over it would have been mitigated if=
 not eliminated. We must go to war rarely and then with the consent of the =
governed, so the governed carry the responsibility and cost of war. But the=
n again, in this age, how do we do this?

                            <strong>Comment:</strong>&nbsp;<em>There are da=
ngers of a serious call for a constitutional convention. There are no guara=
ntees for retaining any of the current document, no restrictions on what ne=
w elements could be introduced, and the divided American public may not be =
able to withstand such a controversial process. Thoughts?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>I agree that a constitutional convention wo=
uld be a mistake. I pointed to it only to make it clear that we must urgent=
ly reconsider how we go to war and that something dramatic must be done, bu=
t God only knows what emerge from such a convention. At the same time, my s=
erious point is that Congress and the president should amend the constituti=
onal clause on war to recognize the changes that have taken place in techno=
logy and such, and to make certain that Congress and the American people ta=
ke responsibility for going to war. It would make it much harder to engage =
in wars, and the world should know from that amendment that the Yanks will =
come only with the support of the nation. I do not ever want to see another=
 war like Vietnam, where the soldiers are drawn from those who didn=E2=80=
=99t have college deferments or minor defects like bone spurs. I am emphati=
cally and overtly not a pacifist, but I want my country to know when it is =
going to war and take responsibility for winning it.

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;</e=
m><em>Could it be possible that the Iranians wanted their nuclear sites to =
be destroyed?&nbsp;</em><em>They weren't secret anymore. It would allow the=
m to save face with their own people, whereas if they gave everything up in=
 a peace deal that would be seen as a huge sign of weakness within their cu=
lture. They could ask for sanctions relief =E2=80=93 since the only&nbsp;ob=
stacle to that was their nuclear program =E2=80=93 which would greatly impr=
ove the economy and the regime=E2=80=99s chance of survival. They might be =
able to move their program to another, far more secretive location, with th=
e U.S. thinking that it had destroyed the threat. And they could separate f=
rom their proxies, since the majority of them were destroyed anyway.</em><b=
r>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>I do not think that the Iranians wanted the=
ir nuclear facilities destroyed. I don=E2=80=99t think the public would hav=
e thought better of them having spent the resources to build a weapon and t=
hen standing by helplessly as the facilities are destroyed. The reason that=
 Iran was building nuclear weapons was not necessarily to use them, but to =
frighten other countries and show their citizens that they were now a great=
 power. There are many subtleties to politics and geopolitics, but showing =
vulnerability and weakness to its citizens and the world rarely benefits a =
regime. The motive for starting to build nuclear weapons was national power=
 and pride. Being so weak that they couldn=E2=80=99t defend the weapons and=
 couldn=E2=80=99t frighten their enemies off was not, in my mind, good poli=
tics =E2=80=93 particularly after Mossad penetrated their country and targe=
ted their leaders. So this idea is too subtle for me to grasp.

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;</e=
m><em>Do you think China wouldn=E2=80=99t eventually try to blockade Taiwan=
 rather than launch a traditional seaborne invasion?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>The precedent for this was the Soviet block=
ade of West Berlin in 1948-49. The U.S. response was a massive airlift to W=
est Berlin that maintained a reasonable life for its inhabitants. The Russi=
ans had the option of shooting down U.S. aircraft. They didn't because that=
 would start a war with the United States. They did not invade West Germany=
 because they were afraid of war. They tried a blockade because it might wo=
rk and didn't involve automatic war.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So in the case of Taiwan, the likely U.S. response would look something lik=
e the Berlin blockade, with a massive airlift from bases in Japan, South Ko=
rea and the Philippines and with huge shipments of supplies by ship to thes=
e airfields. There is a second option =E2=80=93 a U.S. ship, either a warsh=
ip or a transport, passing between blockading ships (a bow-to-stern line of=
 ships being impractical given the size of the blockade). The Chinese would=
 then have the option of striking the U.S. vessel or letting it pass. The t=
hing to bear in mind is that a blockade is what you do when you do not want=
 a war. So shooting down a plane or sinking a ship would lead to war, start=
ed by China. If China wanted to start a war, they would invade Taiwan. So t=
he model of West Berlin, the airlift, is the likely one. It lasted months, =
but a demonstration of extreme patience by the United States, plus the fear=
 of accidentally shooting down a plane, caused Stalin to give up. I do not =
think the U.S. would initiate warfare, but it would undermine the blockade =
=E2=80=93 causing it to fail to starve out Taiwan =E2=80=93 and with U.S. p=
atience demonstrated, China would give up. Best guess.
