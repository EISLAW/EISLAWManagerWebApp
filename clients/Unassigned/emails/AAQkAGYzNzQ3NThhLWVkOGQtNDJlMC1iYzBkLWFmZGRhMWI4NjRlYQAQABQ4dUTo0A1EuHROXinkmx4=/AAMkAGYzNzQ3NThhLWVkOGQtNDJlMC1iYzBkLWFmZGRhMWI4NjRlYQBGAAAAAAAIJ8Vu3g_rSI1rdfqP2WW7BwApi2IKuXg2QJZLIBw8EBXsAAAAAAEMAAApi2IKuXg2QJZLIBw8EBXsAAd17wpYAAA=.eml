=C2=A0

Anyway, here are my picks for the week.

MY SHORT PICK: CBRL

PORTILLO=E2=80=99S INC. (TICKER: PTLO) and CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL (TICKER:
CMG) are performing well for my positions, but not for the stocks
themselves=E2=80=94PTLO is at 52-week lows, and CMG isn=E2=80=99t faring mu=
ch
better. My short pick for the week is CRACKER BARREL OLD COUNTRY STORE
(TICKER: CBRL). The company has been in a prolonged decline, and
recent negative press surrounding its in-store makeover hasn=E2=80=99t
helped. The fast-casual space is under pressure across the board, and
if two strong brands with solid menus like PTLO and CMG are
struggling, it=E2=80=99s hard to see how CBRL stands a chance.
[frep]

_1 YEAR CBRL CHART WITH 1 DAY CANDLES_

_90 DAY IMPLIED VOLATILITY (GREEN) FOR CBRL_

Implied volatility remains elevated out to the 90-day mark, which
suggests traders are still actively buying options and have yet to
unwind those positions. The stock has recovered to its 20-day
highs=E2=80=94levels seen before the recent 'woke mob' controversy=E2=80=94=
but I
view this rebound as temporary with earnings due in early September.
So far, no major restaurant chain has reported strong numbers this
year. Additionally, the options market shows a light institutional
footprint in the outer months, indicating that larger investors
haven=E2=80=99t seen this dip as a buying opportunity. I expect CBRL to
trade sideways to lower heading into earnings.

MY LONG PICK: APA

TKO GROUP HOLDINGS INC. (TICKER: TKO) has been trending lower over the
past two weeks following the major MMA deal announcement. Despite the
pullback, I still like the stock and plan to add to my position if it
drops below $150.

For my Flash 5 subscribers, you're already familiar with APACHE CORP.
(TICKER: APA). I first liked it back in January based on a growing
Option Fingerprint and solid earnings, though the broader market
didn=E2=80=99t agree at the time. My call options expired worthless, but I
held onto the shares=E2=80=94and now I=E2=80=99m nearly back to breakeven. =
Since
then, APA has continued to post strong earnings, pay dividends, and
looks ready to move back into the high $20s. I=E2=80=99ll give you two
reasons why.
[frep]

1 YEAR CHART OF APA WITH 1 DAY CANDLES AND 90 DAY IV ON THE BOTTOM
CHART

Reason #1: The open interest on the APA Jan 2027 20 calls is over 20k
now. This customer purchased the calls near the absolute low, and
there=E2=80=99s been a sizable buyer stepping in as the price moved into the
$18 range. They haven=E2=80=99t exited the position yet=E2=80=94and so far,=
 that
customer=E2=80=99s timing has been spot on.
[frep]

Reason #2: Licia loved the chart! APA is trading at just 7x earnings,
and options dated into 2026 and beyond are extremely inexpensive. As
we move past the NVDA-driven momentum into year-end, funds typically
rotate into value names=E2=80=94and APA fits that profile well. The strong
institutional footprint is another positive signal.
