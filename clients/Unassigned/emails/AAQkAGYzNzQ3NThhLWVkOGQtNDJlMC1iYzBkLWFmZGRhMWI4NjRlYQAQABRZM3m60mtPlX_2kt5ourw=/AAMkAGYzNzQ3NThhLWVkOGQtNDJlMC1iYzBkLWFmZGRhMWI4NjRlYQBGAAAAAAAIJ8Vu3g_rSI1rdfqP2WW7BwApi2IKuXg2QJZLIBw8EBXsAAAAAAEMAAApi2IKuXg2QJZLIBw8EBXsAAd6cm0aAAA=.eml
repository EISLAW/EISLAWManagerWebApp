The Day I Realized My Financial Advisor Was Actually Costing Me Money

_AND WHY A 35-YEAR TRADING VETERAN JUST PUT HIS OWN CASH INTO A "SMALL
ACCOUNT" STRATEGY THAT MADE 10.63% WHILE THE MARKET CRASHED_

Look, I need to be honest with you about something.

I've been getting these letters from my financial advisor lately, and
they're... well, they're almost comical how bad they are.

Every time the market turns red, I get these anonymous, generic
letters telling me "don't panic" and "the worst thing you could do is
pull out your money."

But here's what they DON'T tell me: what are they actually DOING to
help me during these crashes?

The answer? Absolutely nothing. They just want me to sit there and
watch my money evaporate while they collect their fees.

THE $1.4 MILLION REALITY CHECK

Here's something that'll make your blood boil: we calculated that if
you added up all the market drawdowns over the last 45 years, a
passive "buy and hold" strategy would've lost over $1.4 MILLION IN
EVAPORATED WEALTH.

Your financial advisor will never tell you this number.

They'll just send you another one of those useless letters about
"staying the course."

THEN I WATCHED THIS TRAINING THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Yesterday, I was sitting in on a live training with Licia - she's an
ex-CBOT market maker who's been quietly crushing it with a strategy
specifically designed for small accounts.

WHILE THE MARKET DROPPED 12% IN THREE DAYS BACK IN APRIL, LICIA'S
ACCOUNT GREW 10.63%.

But that's not even the crazy part.

The crazy part happened halfway through the training when Andrew - a
guy who's been trading for 35 YEARS and runs multiple trading services
here - jumps into the chat and basically says:

_"You know what? I'm done watching from the sidelines. I'm putting my
own money into this challenge."_

I'm sitting there thinking... if a 35-year veteran is willing to put
his own cash on the line to learn from Licia, what am I missing?

HERE'S WHAT I WITNESSED LIVE

Licia doesn't just talk about making money during crashes - she
actually showed us the EXACT trades she made during April's meltdown.

March 31st, April 3rd, April 11th, April 22nd...

THE RESULTS? A traditional investment strategy would've made $480
during that period. Licia made $950 - nearly double - with only
$5,000.

And Andrew? He's been in the chat every day since, actually executing
these trades himself, sharing his fills, even getting into friendly
competitions with other members.

HERE'S THE CRAZY PART: SHE GUARANTEES IT

Licia is so confident in this strategy that she's put a PERFORMANCE
GUARANTEE on it. If she doesn't 4X the S&P 500 over the next six
months, you get a $500 credit.

THAT'S MORE THAN THE ENTIRE COST OF THE CHALLENGE.

Think about that - your financial advisor won't even guarantee they'll
beat inflation, but Licia's guaranteeing to crush the market by 4X or
give you $500.

WHY THIS CHALLENGE IS DIFFERENT

I want to be very clear: this isn't some complicated system. Licia
designed this specifically for people with small accounts who want to
be active during market crashes instead of sitting there helplessly.

 	* Only need $5,000 to start
 	* Level 1 options only (simple calls and puts)
 	* Never more than $300 per trade
 	* 2-3 trades per week maximum
 	* Complete trade plans for every position

WATCH WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS TRAINING

You need to see this replay.

You'll watch Licia break down exactly how she spotted the
opportunities during April's crash, see the actual pitchfork charts
she uses, and witness Andrew - a 35-year veteran - getting genuinely
excited about learning something new.

There's this moment where Andrew says, "I'm not getting any younger.
If I want to get better at looking at charts, I'm just gonna watch
Licia because all her products consistently make money."

COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN TRADING SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN? THAT
HIT DIFFERENT.

WHY I'M SHARING THIS WITH YOU

I'm tired of watching people get screwed over by financial advisors
who do nothing during the times when you need them most.

I'm tired of those ridiculous letters that basically say "just hold on
and hope for the best."

THIS TRAINING REPLAY SHOWS YOU A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY.

You'll see how someone with real floor trading experience actually
capitalizes on market chaos.=C2=A0

You'll watch a 35-year veteran put his own money where his mouth is.
And you'll get the exact blueprint for how to stop being a victim of
market drawdowns and start profiting from them.

The challenge deadline is in less than 24 hours. When the next crash
happens, do you want another useless letter from your advisor, or do
you want to be actively making money like Licia and her members did in
April?

[Hannah Signature]

P.S. There's this moment in the replay where Licia teases a trade
she's looking at for that afternoon, and Andrew immediately perks up
because he knows he's about to make money while the market does
whatever crazy thing it's going to do. That energy is infectious.
