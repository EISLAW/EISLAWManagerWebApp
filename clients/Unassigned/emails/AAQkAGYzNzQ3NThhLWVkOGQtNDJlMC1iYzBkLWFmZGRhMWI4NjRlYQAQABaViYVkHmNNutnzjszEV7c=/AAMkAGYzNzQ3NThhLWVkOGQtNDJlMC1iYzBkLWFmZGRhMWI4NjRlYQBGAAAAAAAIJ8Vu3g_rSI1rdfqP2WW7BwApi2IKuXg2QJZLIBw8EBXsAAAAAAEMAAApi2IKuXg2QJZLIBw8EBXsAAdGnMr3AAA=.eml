orker sentiment survey [ https://substack.com/redirect/d7cdfc45-2c05-4c1e-b=

y88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], in particular about burnout. Re=
aders asked, =E2=80=9CWho are these people who aren=E2=80=99t burned-out?=
=E2=80=9D
So we decided to do a timely follow-up investigation to find out the common=
 threads among respondents who:
Haven=E2=80=99t felt much (or any) burnout in recent months/years
Have felt burned-out but were able to deal with it extremely effectively
Feel like they=E2=80=99ve cracked the =E2=80=9Csecret code=E2=80=9D for dea=
ling with burnout
We ran open-ended, video-based surveys with about 175 respondents and inter=
viewed about 15 people who reported low to no burnout in the original surve=
y.
Our respondents revealed that dealing with burnout isn=E2=80=99t simply abo=
ut resilience or stress management. The key is to systematically design a c=
areer and lifestyle that make burnout structurally unlikely.
We call tech workers who manage to do this =E2=80=9Cburnout conquerors.=E2=

Introducing ARMOR: five shields against burnout
My investigation revealed five core strategies for dealing with burnout. Th=
ese strategies are the armor that tech workers are donning to protect thems=
elves from burnout.
A: Autonomy
Many people we heard from immediately identified that autonomy is a critica=
l ingredient to being happy at work.
We also saw this again and again in our research.
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve had strong leaders who believed in my development and=
 let me run with high autonomy to solve challenging problems. I=E2=80=99m h=
appy more than 95% of the time.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI intentionally seek out environments where I have autonomy and va=
riety in my day-to-day work, which keeps things fresh and prevents stagnati=
on. Ultimately, choosing a path that matches my strengths and curiosity has=
 made all the difference in sustaining my motivation and well-being.=E2=80=
=9D
Burnout conquerors continuously strive to create as much autonomy over thei=
r work lives as possible. Here=E2=80=99s how:
1. Proactively take control of your time and efforts
Burnout conquerors keep a keen eye on how they spend their time and energy =
at work to make sure they=E2=80=99re working smarter, not harder. An open b=
lock in their calendar to do deep work isn=E2=80=99t just going to drop in =
from the sky. Their most productive hours aren=E2=80=99t going to magically=
 become available for priority work. Burnout conquerors make their days the=
ir own.
=E2=80=9CFor me, burnout happens when I become ineffective at my job, no ma=
tter how many hours I put in. When I start to feel like I=E2=80=99m not mak=
ing progress, I immediately start examining why. A perfect example is right=
 now=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve not moved the needle with my priorities in weeks.=
 There=E2=80=99s been a lot of firefighting, but nothing proactive. I start=
ed to examine what I=E2=80=99m spending time on and how I can pivot to spen=
ding time on what I should be doing. Calendar audit was step #1, declined m=
eetings I really didn=E2=80=99t need to be in, blocked off heads-down time,=
 and, in a matter of days, I=E2=80=99m back on track.=E2=80=9D
2. Hit your goals to build trust
Rather than expecting trust in the workplace, burnout conquerors earn it by=
 consistently delivering regardless of the external circumstances. The more=
 you deliver on what you promised, the more everyone will trust you and lea=
ve you alone to do what you need to do. But that trust is not granted; it=
=E2=80=99s earned through behavior and successes (which is accomplished by =
taking control of time!).
=E2=80=9CI control what I do; I control my success. I=E2=80=99m responsible=
 for my failures. Some days are hard, and some people are difficult, but I =
choose how to respond and handle the situation to deliver on my goals.=E2=
=80=9D
To get this done, burnout conquerors focus on small sets of quality outcome=
s driven by highly targeted goals, which they communicate up, down, and all=
 around.
3. Overcommunicate your needs to others=E2=80=94and yourselves
Burnout conquerors understand their own needs and communicate them clearly =
and appropriately to the people around them. They know that when people kno=
w what to expect of you, they are rarely caught off-guard and feel more com=
fortable letting you take the wheel. A common tactic for burnout avoidance =
we heard is to =E2=80=9Covercommunicate=E2=80=9D about everything.
That includes far more than just what you=E2=80=99re working on and what re=
sources you need to get it done.=20
=E2=80=9CMost of my peers focus on communicating what they=E2=80=99re worki=
ng on. They forget about [communicating] the =E2=80=98hows=E2=80=99: their =
boundaries, their constraints, and their strengths.=E2=80=9D
Burnout conquerors overcommunicate how to best work with them and how they =
like to communicate, receive feedback, and make decisions. Set the foundati=
ons of those conversations with a =E2=80=9CHow I Work=E2=80=9D document. Fi=
nd a template here [ https://substack.com/redirect/660213b4-6b3c-4dc5-9a6f-=

R: Rock-solid boundaries
Burnout conquerors know that to ruthlessly protect their time and energy, t=
hey need to erect boundaries that can withstand the pressure of a fast-pace=
d and results-driven workplace. Here=E2=80=99s how:
1. Set, automate, and, yes, overcommunicate clear work-life boundaries
Burnout conquerors create consistent time-based (e.g. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m =
ending the day at 6 p.m. to be with my kids=E2=80=9D) or task-based (e.g. =
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll focus on 3 to 5 essential and urgent tasks each day=
=E2=80=9D) hard stops. Anything beyond that time or list gets pushed to ano=
ther time (or delegated to AI agents [ https://substack.com/redirect/775893=
ed-c1c3-4b17-b866-7e7952749634?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshg=
UC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]).
=E2=80=9CI try to be strict about when I=E2=80=99m not going to do work. Mo=
re than generic advice about =E2=80=98disconnecting,=E2=80=99 setting reall=
y clear micro-rules for myself has helped me prevent work stress seeping in=
to the rest of my life. I know it might sound sad to even need these micro-=
boundaries, but it was necessary, and it=E2=80=99s been incredibly helpful.=
=E2=80=9D
To ensure that those boundaries hold, the people we heard from automate the=
ir after-hours responses and set clear calendar blocks, so people get notif=
ied when they=E2=80=99re unavailable. They also share their working schedul=
e with their colleagues up front, including daily constraints and personal =
needs, and then as needed when those boundaries get tested (which they alwa=
ys do).
2. Get comfortable saying no [ https://substack.com/redirect/b8695de5-ae67-=
4803-a126-eb5a24dc8702?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Boundaries will always get tested by new requests or projects=E2=80=94some =
of which are exciting and seriously appealing! But there=E2=80=99s always a=
n opportunity cost. Burnout conquerors understand that saying yes to someth=
ing means saying no to something else.
They reframe no=E2=80=99s as tradeoffs=E2=80=94to themselves and others.
=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t frame responses to colleagues with open-ended ques=
tions that block my ability to define a =E2=80=98ready=E2=80=99 state. To o=
verly simplify, I don=E2=80=99t say, =E2=80=98I have options A or B. Which =
do you want?=E2=80=99 I say, =E2=80=98I have option A and B. Here=E2=80=99s=
 how we got to these options. Here are the tradeoffs. Please let me know yo=
ur thoughts. I=E2=80=99ll move forward with A if I don=E2=80=99t hear any n=
ew feedback.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI read this book called You Have a Choice by Eric Nehrlich. One of=
 the big unlocks for me was =E2=80=98You don=E2=80=99t have to do anything =
you don=E2=80=99t want to . . . as long as you=E2=80=99re okay with the con=
sequences.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D
3. Take real breaks: rhythmic, reflective, restorative
Breaks are necessary and reasonable for the roles and responsibilities we a=
ll have in this industry. Performing at a high level is essential at work, =
but turning off is too.
=E2=80=9CSomeone once told me, =E2=80=98We=E2=80=99re not performing brain =
surgery,=E2=80=99 and it was such a good reality check. Unless you=E2=80=99=
re a literal brain surgeon, it=E2=80=99s OK to not be perfect and available=
 all the time. When I=E2=80=99m on, I=E2=80=99m on 100%. And when I=E2=80=
=99m off, I=E2=80=99m off 100%.=E2=80=9D
We heard a lot about the types of breaks that are successful in helping peo=
ple prevent burnout. We categorized them into three types.
