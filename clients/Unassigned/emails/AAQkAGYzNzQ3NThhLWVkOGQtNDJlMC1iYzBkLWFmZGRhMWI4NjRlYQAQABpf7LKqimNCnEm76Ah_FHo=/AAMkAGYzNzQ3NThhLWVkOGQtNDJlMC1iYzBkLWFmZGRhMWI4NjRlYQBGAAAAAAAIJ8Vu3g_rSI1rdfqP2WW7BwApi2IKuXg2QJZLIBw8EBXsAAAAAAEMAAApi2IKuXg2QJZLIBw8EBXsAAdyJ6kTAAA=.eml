-my-17-predictions-for-2025

Right now, you're drowning in AI predictions. Every day brings another brea=
thless announcement about how AI will revolutionize everything. Most of us =
tune it out. Heck, I tune it out too. And roll my eyes.
How do you separate what's actually happening from pure hype?
Well around here I like to be up front about what I=E2=80=99m getting right=
 and what I=E2=80=99m missing. That's where this honest scorecard comes in.=
 Eight months ago, I put my credibility on the line with 17 specific predic=
tions about 2025 [ https://substack.com/redirect/947a3820-28f3-4a90-9a0c-3f=
707306ed4c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMP=
Ow0 ]. Not vague hand-waving about "AI transformation," but concrete predic=
tions. Stuff that=E2=80=99s falsifiable. I wanted to hold myself accountabl=
e.
The clock hasn=E2=80=99t run out on 2025, but I thought it was time for a l=
ittle checkup. What hit already, what partially landed, and what completely=
 flopped? Yes, even though there=E2=80=99s time on the clock I think we can=
 say a few of these are probably flops lol
Here's what you'll learn from my successes and failures:
First, you'll get a reality filter for AI hype. When I tell you AI companio=
ns are already a $120 million market but smart mirrors are going nowhere, y=
ou can adjust your own strategies accordingly. These aren't theoretical mus=
ings=E2=80=94this is what's actually happening in August 2025.
Second, you'll understand the "jaggedness" of AI adoption. One of my bigges=
t insights is that AI transformation isn't uniform=E2=80=94it's happening i=
n dramatic pockets while other areas remain untouched. Knowing which is whi=
ch could save you from betting on the wrong trend.
Third, you'll learn to spot patterns that matter. My misses are arguably mo=
re valuable than my hits. I completely missed that 2025 would be the year o=
f AI coding, that people would form emotional attachments to specific LLM v=
ersions, and that open-source models would explode. If I=E2=80=94someone ob=
sessively tracking this space=E2=80=94missed these, you might be missing th=
em too.
The stakes? We're in the middle of the fastest technological transformation=
 in history. We need to learn pattern matching, how to see actual trends, h=
ow to keep ourselves honest. I=E2=80=99m trying to model it here.
So let me show you what I got right, what I got sorta ok right, and what I =
just got wrong. And let=E2=80=99s learn together how to think more accurate=
ly about the future along the way=E2=80=A6

Grading My 17 Predictions for 2025: A Mid-Year Reality Check
Back in January, I put my money where my mouth is and laid out 17 predictio=
ns for 2025. Now, eight months into the year, it's time for some brutal hon=
esty about what's working and what isn't. Because I believe in transparency=
, I'm going through every single prediction with a clear grading rubric=E2=
=80=94and you can push back if you think I'm being too generous (or too har=
sh) with myself.
Here's the breakdown: Out of 17 predictions, I'm calling 7 home runs, 6 par=
tial hits, and 4 complete misses. That's a 41% hit rate, 35% partial credit=
, and 24% strikeout rate. Not perfect, but not terrible for trying to predi=
ct the wild world of AI.
Let's dive into all 17, starting with the wins.
The Hits: 7 Predictions That Landed
1. AI Creators Come Out of the Closet
Original prediction: We'll see AI characters and creators compete with huma=
n creators, with several popular AI OnlyFans accounts emerging.
Grade: HIT
This one absolutely happened. AI OnlyFans creators are now earning $10,000+=
 per month with reported 312% revenue growth=E2=80=94and those numbers are =
probably much higher now. We're seeing AI-native creative agencies openly m=
arketing their AI usage as a selling point, not hiding it. Major platforms =
are allowing AI content because, frankly, it's sticky and engaging.
The cultural shift I predicted=E2=80=94from shame to pride about using AI=
=E2=80=94has fully materialized. Creators aren't just admitting AI involvem=
ent; they're building it into their brand identity.
2. Your Feed Goes Synthetic
Original prediction: More than 50% AI content in Instagram feeds by year-en=
d 2025.
Grade: HIT
We're at 38.5% of Instagram feeds being heavily AI-influenced already, betw=
een creative elements using AI and full AI creators. Meta has deeply integr=
ated AI content generation tools into their platforms, and increasingly, us=
ers can't distinguish AI from human content.
The advances in image and video generation this year have been staggering. =
Have you seen Google's Genie 3? It generates immersive worlds as you naviga=
te them=E2=80=94the world literally doesn't exist until you go there, then =
it appears. Google even has a tiny LLM navigating worlds created by another=
 LLM. An AI living in the mind of another AI. I didn't predict that specifi=
c twist, but boy, would have been cool if I did.
3. The Revenge of Audio
Original prediction: We'll get personalized AI companion voices like in the=
 movie "Her."
Grade: HIT
OpenAI's voice assistant has been explicitly compared to "Her" throughout 2=
025. We have contextually aware AI voice systems being deployed. Emotional =
AI voice companions are becoming mainstream.
This prediction was such a hit that when ChatGPT-5 came out and the voice c=
hanged, people complained. They wanted the old 4.0 voice back because they'=
d formed attachments to it. That's how you know voice AI has truly arrived=
=E2=80=94when people get upset about losing their preferred AI voice.
4. Your New Colleague Is An AI (Non-Tech)
Original prediction: AI adoption spreads beyond tech into traditional indus=
tries.
Grade: HIT
45% of US workers now report using AI tools at work. AI adoption is spreadi=
ng beyond tech into traditional industries at an accelerating pace. While w=
e're not at the point where every company has an AI you can tag in Slack, m=
any companies do. If that feels like science fiction to you, that's more a =
function of your company context than where the tech actually is.
5. Visual AI Unicorn (Companionship)
Original prediction: A visual AI unicorn with widespread adoption, probably=
 around relationships/companionship.
Grade: HIT
Digital girlfriends and boyfriends are absolutely a thing now. Grok's visua=
l companions are rolling out on a massive scale. The AI companion market as=
 a whole is hitting $120 million+ per year with widespread adoption and exp=
loding growth. This trend is only going to accelerate in the remaining four=
 months of the year.
6. Memory Changes Everything
Original prediction: AI will get "unlimited memory" that feels like it reme=
mbers months of context.
Grade: HIT
ChatGPT launched unlimited memory exactly as I predicted. We now have Claud=
e investing in memory too. Cross-conversation memory is happening. AI agent=
s with different memory strategies are proliferating. They're using "lossy =
math" approaches to approximate human memory, and it feels like magic.
This is one of the defining AI transformations of 2025. By year's end, we'l=
l have even better memory features across more LLMs and agents.
7. The Great Authentication Crisis
Original prediction: Perfect deepfakes would cause authentication crises, w=
ith a CEO potentially being voice-cloned for fraud.
Grade: HIT
Perfect deepfakes are now trivially easy to create. Identity verification i=
s becoming a massive issue. We're having to go to greater and greater lengt=
hs to prove our identity.
My specific prediction about a CEO being defrauded through voice cloning fr=
om earnings calls? I can't definitively prove it's happened yet=E2=80=94tho=
ugh I wonder if companies would even report it if it did. But the overall t=
rend is absolutely in my favor. We have all the building blocks on the tabl=
e in August 2025 for this to happen.
The Partials: 6 Predictions Half-Right
8. AI Joins the Party (Literally)
Original prediction: AI-human meetups and dating platforms launching.
Grade: PARTIAL
AI-human dating platforms are launching. Virtual companions in social setti=
ngs are starting to happen. But the blocker here is actually social etiquet=
te, not technology. We need a breakthrough app that makes it socially accep=
table to bring your digital companion to lunch with the parents.
Am I doubling down? Yes. This is coming, whether it sounds weird or not.
9. The "AI Skills" Ultimatum
Original prediction: AI literacy becomes a job requirement with workplace d=
ivisions over adoption.
Grade: PARTIAL
AI literacy is becoming a job requirement for some roles, not all. Workplac=
es are starting to divide over AI adoption. Training programs are prolifera=
ting.
What makes this partial is that it's happening in particular sectors of the=
 economy, not economy-wide. AI transformation is as jagged as AI intelligen=
ce itself=E2=80=94something I didn't fully appreciate in January. I'm betti=
ng this jaggedness continues, with pockets of radical transformation alongs=
ide pockets of minimal change.
10. Big Tech's Agent Fiasco
Original prediction: Billions in market cap losses from agent failures.
Grade: PARTIAL
I predicted someone would get agents so wrong there'd be billions in market=
 cap losses. Can't prove that specifically happened (though companies might=
 not advertise such losses).
But the larger trend is clear: Big tech leaned heavily on the agent hype tr=
ain, and we're seeing major pullback. 40% of AI agent projects are likely t=
o be canceled by 2027. We've had very public failures. Gartner predicts wid=
espread agent shakeout.
As someone bullish on agents long-term, I see this as the classic hype cycl=
e=E2=80=94we're heading for the trough of disillusionment before reaching t=
he plateau of productivity. The problem? The number of people who can succe=
ssfully implement production agents is maybe a tenth of the demand.
11. The Hardware Plot Twist
Original prediction: OpenAI would release a non-phone hardware device in 20=
25.
Grade: PARTIAL
OpenAI is confirmed to be developing a hardware device with Jony Ive=E2=80=
=94pocket-sized, not a phone. But it's delayed until 2026 at the earliest. =
I'm giving myself partial credit because the project exists, but I was off =
on timing. I'm doubling down that this will happen, just later than predict=
ed.
12. The AGI Debate Gets Weird
Original prediction: We'd have AI with IQ scores of 180-220 but still no co=
nsensus on AGI.
Grade: PARTIAL
AI systems are achieving high IQ scores yet failing basic tests. Andrej Kar=
pathy famously called out that AI sometimes doesn't realize 9.11 is smaller=
 than 9.89=E2=80=94it just doesn't look that way if you're not doing actual=
 math.
The debate is absolutely getting weirder with each release. But I'm backing=
 away from AGI being as central as I positioned it. AGI definitions might m=
atter less than I thought, even as the debate continues to get weird.
13. AI Safety Gets Personal
Original prediction: Boom in AI-off spaces and AI detox programs.
Grade: PARTIAL
There's early motion here=E2=80=94AI-off spaces and detox programs are emer=
ging. Public health implications of over-affirming AI are getting reported.=
 Personal AI boundaries are becoming a conversation topic. AI companions ar=
e becoming an issue in human romantic relationships.
But it's not fully realized yet. I was too ahead of the curve. This feels m=
ore like a 2026-2027 phenomenon to get truly widespread.
The Misses: 4 Predictions That Flopped
14. The AI Labor Question
Original prediction: AI consciousness activism disrupting board meetings.
Grade: MISS
While people certainly discuss AI consciousness, it's remained mostly acade=
mic and in chat rooms. No board meeting disruptions. No activists demanding=
 AI labor rights at shareholder meetings. I just didn't correctly predict t=
his one. The consciousness conversation exists, but not as the disruptive f=
orce I imagined.
15. The Smart Mirror Renaissance
Original prediction: Major investment in smart mirrors for visual AI applic=
ations.
Grade: MISS
We've had a few fitness and health applications, but no major breakthrough.=
 Smart mirrors aren't on track to become household products. I thought peop=
le would want visual AI for trying on outfits and getting exercise feedback=
=2E The laundry-folding robot I saw rec=
ently looks way too expensive to be pr=
actical. I was just wrong on this one, and I'm not doubling down.
16. Humanoid Robots' iPhone Moment
Original prediction: Robot commercials at Super Bowl 2026.
Grade: MISS
I still have time on the clock for the Super Bowl commercial, but broadly s=
peaking, we don't have the iPhone moment for robots. We're still "a year or=
 two away," as we have been for a while. Production robots exist but remain=
 too expensive and impractical for most households. I was too early on this=
 one.
17. AI Weddings
Original prediction: Someone would attempt a human-AI wedding.
Grade: MISS
Despite all the companionship developments, I've seen zero traction on AI w=
eddings anywhere in the world. No legal frameworks. No countries stepping u=
p to offer them. Nobody's gone viral claiming they want to marry their AI.
The companionship trend is real and sticking around, but weddings? I jumped=
 in the water way too early on that one.
What I Wish I'd Predicted
Looking back, there are three massive trends I completely missed:
1. LLM Affinity: I should have predicted the emotional attachment people wo=
uld form to specific LLM versions. When ChatGPT-5 rolled out and people dem=
anded 4.0 back, I had all the ingredients there=E2=80=94I talked about comp=
anionship and emotional bonding. Should have seen it coming.
2. The Year of Code: AI and code has been THE story of 2025, with massive i=
nvestment from every major lab. I didn't connect the dots between code and =
agents, or see how central code would be to flagship releases. All the ingr=
edients were on the table.
3. The Open Source Explosion: I completely missed the proliferation of open=
-source models. There are now hundreds of excellent open-source models, inc=
luding incredible American, European, and Chinese models you can run locall=
y. I should have better predicted how quickly LLM technology would prolifer=
ate beyond the major labs.
The Final Score
So there you have it: 41% hits, 35% partials, 24% complete misses.
When you're trying to predict the future of AI=E2=80=94a field moving at br=
eakneck speed with jagged, unpredictable progress=E2=80=94I'll take those n=
umbers. The hits captured fundamental shifts in how humans interact with AI=
=2E The partials identified real trends=
 that are manifesting differently or m=
ore slowly than expected. And the misses? Well, they teach humility about p=
redicting exponential change.
What do you think I graded wrong? What trends am I still missing? Let me kn=
ow=E2=80=94because if 2025 has taught me anything, it's that the wildest pr=
edictions might not be wild enough.=20
Hopefully I learn from my predictions and get the 2026 slate better=E2=80=
