Scaling RL Compute for LLMs Becomes Predictable (paper [ https://substack.c=

zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs (Khatri et al., =
2025) - Meta AI and UT Austin researchers tackle the =E2=80=9Cmystery box=
=E2=80=9D of RL fine-tuning for language models. They conduct a 400,000 GPU=
-hour study and find that RL performance scales in a sigmoid-shaped curve (=
an S-curve) rather than the open-ended power-law seen in pre-training. Earl=
y on, gains are slow, then a phase of rapid improvement, then saturation - =
meaning additional compute yields diminishing returns. Crucially, this pred=
ictable curve allows extrapolating a small-run=E2=80=99s results to a much =
larger run, bringing much-needed predictability to RL for LLMs. The authors=
 identify that not all RL =E2=80=9Crecipes=E2=80=9D reach the same performa=
nce ceiling: some fine-tuning strategies plateau higher than others. They a=
lso observe that many design details (loss functions, advantage normalizati=
on, data curriculum, off-policy vs on-policy updates) mainly affect compute=
 efficiency (how fast reward improves) without changing the ultimate achiev=
able reward. By combining the best choices from their ablations, they propo=
se a =E2=80=9CScaleRL=E2=80=9D recipe of best practices (e.g. using an asyn=
chronous pipeline, a stable loss function called CISPO, FP32 precision at t=
he output layer, adaptive prompt curricula). ScaleRL produced near-ideal si=
gmoid scaling behavior, allowing a single RL run up to 100k GPU-hours to hi=
t predicted performance targets. Key takeaway: RL fine-tuning can be transf=
ormed from trial-and-error art into a more exact science - labs can now for=
ecast how much reward improvement an extra 10=C3=97 compute will bring, pot=
entially saving time and compute.
Tensor Logic - Unifying Neural and Symbolic AI (paper [ https://substack.co=

y88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Tensor Logic: The Language of AI (Domingos, 2025) - A bold proposal for a n=
ew programming paradigm that bridges deep learning and logic. This paper in=
troduces tensor logic, a minimal yet expressive language designed to serve =
as a common foundation for neural networks, symbolic reasoning, and probabi=
listic models. The sole programming construct is the =E2=80=9Ctensor equati=
on=E2=80=9D, based on the insight that logical inference rules can be viewe=
d as tensor operations (Einstein summation) on Boolean tensors. In practice=
, tensor logic treats relations (as in logic programs) as sparse tensors, a=
nd logical rules (like in Datalog) correspond to performing joins and summa=
tions on those tensors followed by non-linearities. This means that a trans=
former attention head, a Prolog rule, a kernel machine, or a factor graph c=
an all be written in the same tensor equation language. By leveraging moder=
n autodiff and GPU compute (similar to PyTorch/TensorFlow), tensor logic pr=
omises to support learning and reasoning in one framework. For example, it =
could enable =E2=80=9Csound reasoning in embedding space,=E2=80=9D combinin=
g neural nets=E2=80=99 pattern recognition with the rigor of logical rules.=
 The author demonstrates how various AI models (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, transform=
ers, symbolic logic programs, graphical models) can be concisely expressed =
in tensor logic. If widely adopted, this unified language could eliminate t=
he divide between differentiable AI and symbolic AI, offering both the scal=
ability of tensors and the transparency of logic in a single system.

RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework (Guo et al., 2025) - Extending retri=
eval-augmented LLMs beyond text. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typic=
ally allows an LLM to fetch textual documents to overcome knowledge cutoff.=
 However, knowledge in the real world is multimodal - images, tables, chart=
s, math equations - and current RAG systems handle primarily text, missing =
a lot. This work presents RAG-Anything, a framework enabling LLMs to retrie=
ve and reason over any modality. The key idea is to represent multimodal co=
ntent (text, visuals, audio, etc.) as interconnected knowledge graphs rathe=
r than separate data silos. RAG-Anything builds a dual-graph representation=
 of a knowledge base: one graph captures cross-modal relationships (e.g. an=
 image and its caption or a table and its description), while another captu=
res textual semantic similarity. It then performs a cross-modal hybrid retr=
ieval that combines structural navigation (following links/relationships in=
 the graph) with semantic matching (embedding-based search). This allows th=
e system to fetch evidence that spans multiple modalities in a coherent way=
=2E The authors report that RAG-Anythin=
g significantly outperforms text-only=20=
retrieval on challenging multimodal QA benchmarks. Gains are especially lar=
ge for long documents that include mixtures of text and figures, where trad=
itional RAG fails to gather the relevant pieces. By eliminating the modalit=
y-specific fragmentation in knowledge access, this unified approach lets LL=
Ms use images, diagrams, tables, etc. as seamlessly as text. (The code is o=
pen-sourced, signaling a push toward truly multimodal chat assistants.)

Agent Learning via Early Experience (Zhang et al., 2025) - A new training p=
aradigm from Meta=E2=80=99s AI lab for language agents to bootstrap themsel=
ves. Modern LLM-based agents often rely on imitation learning from human de=
monstrations because true reinforcement learning is hard without well-defin=
ed rewards or requires huge trial-and-error rollouts. This paper proposes =
=E2=80=9Cearly experience=E2=80=9D as a middle ground: let the agent loose =
to interact with the environment without external rewards, and use the resu=
lting states as self-supervision signals. In essence, the agent generates i=
ts own trajectories (even if suboptimal) and learns from them in two ways: =
(1) Implicit world modeling - predicting the future state transitions it wi=
ll see, to internalize the environment=E2=80=99s dynamics. And (2) self-ref=
lection - analyzing its own actions by generating natural language explanat=
ions of what went wrong or could be improved, thereby refining its decision=
 policy. Crucially, all this learning happens without any reward function, =
purely from the agent=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cexperience=E2=80=9D of cause and e=
ffect. Across eight diverse tasks (web browsing, tool use, navigation, etc.=
), agents bootstrapped with early experience data outperform those trained =
only on expert demos, showing better generalization to new situations. For =
instance, an agent that had a chance to practice in an environment, even wi=
thout rewards, later performs more robustly than one that only imitated fix=
ed expert trajectories. Moreover, when actual rewards are available, starti=
ng from early experience gives a head-start - these agents offer a strong f=
oundation for subsequent RL fine-tuning. This paradigm thus bridges the gap=
 between purely imitation-based agents and fully autonomous RL agents, sugg=
esting that even =E2=80=9Creward-free=E2=80=9D interaction can substantiall=
y improve an AI=E2=80=99s competence and adaptability.

Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Agentic Reasoning (Yu et al., 2025) =
- A comprehensive study dissects how to best fine-tune LLMs with RL for com=
plex reasoning tasks. The authors investigate RL-enhanced =E2=80=9Cagentic=
=E2=80=9D LLMs (models that use tools and multi-step reasoning) along three=
 axes: the training data, the RL algorithm/hyperparameters, and the agent=
=E2=80=99s reasoning mode. Through extensive experiments, they identify sev=
eral key practices for success: (i) Use high-quality, real interaction traj=
ectories instead of stitched or simulated ones. Replacing synthetically sti=
tched tool-use sequences with real end-to-end examples led to a much strong=
er starting model via supervised fine-tuning, and maintaining a diverse, mo=
del-aware dataset throughout RL greatly boosted performance. (ii) Apply exp=
loration-friendly RL techniques. The study found that allowing the policy m=
ore freedom - e.g. using a higher clipping threshold on advantages, adding =
gentle reward shaping for long trajectories, and keeping some entropy (rand=
omness) in the policy - is crucial for efficient training. These help the m=
odel explore solution paths rather than getting stuck. (iii) Optimize the a=
gent=E2=80=99s reasoning style: A surprising insight is that less can be mo=
re - an agent that plans with fewer, more targeted tool calls and avoids ov=
erly verbose chain-of-thought actually achieves higher accuracy and tool ef=
ficiency. In other words, deliberative reasoning beats constant tool use or=
 endless self-talk in these benchmarks. Implementing these practices, the a=
uthors show that even a 4B-parameter model can outperform a 32B model on co=
mplex agent benchmarks when using their improved RL recipe. They also relea=
se a high-quality dataset (with real tool-usage traces and an RL fine-tunin=
g set) to serve as a strong baseline for future research. All together, thi=
s work provides a much-needed empirical guidebook for RLHF-style training o=
f reasoning agents, pinpointing what actually moves the needle in making LL=
Ms more effective decision-makers.

How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning=
 (Tsilivis et al., 2025) - A deep dive into the mechanics of fine-tuning LL=
Ms with RL on reasoning tasks. Recent breakthroughs in mathematical and log=
ical reasoning by LLMs have relied on a recipe: first pre-train on next-tok=
en prediction, then fine-tune with RL (e.g. optimizing a reward for correct=
 answers). This paper asks why the RL stage is so effective. The authors de=
velop a theoretical framework using a toy parity bit task and prove that RL=
 fine-tuning enables generalization that next-token training alone cannot a=
chieve without exponentially more data or compute. The intuition is that an=
 RL objective can leverage longer chain-of-thoughts at test time - effectiv=
ely letting the model use additional computation (by generating longer expl=
anations/steps) to solve a task. In their setup, the training data is a mix=
ture of short and long reasoning sequences (e.g. mostly short explanations =
with a few long detailed ones). They show mathematically that an autoregres=
sive model trained only by imitation (next-token) struggles to learn the ra=
re long dependencies. But if you then apply RL that rewards correct final a=
nswers, the model learns to use the occasional long chain-of-thought to get=
 those answers right, even when such long examples were sparse in the data.=
 Essentially, RL fine-tuning teaches the model when to deploy a long reason=
ing chain. The authors prove, in a simplified linear model, that as long as=
 a non-negligible fraction of long trajectories exist, this two-stage train=
ing efficiently learns the underlying task, whereas next-token learning wou=
ld need an impractical amount of long examples. They confirm these phenomen=
a on real LLMs (LLaMA models) on math reasoning benchmarks: models with an =
RL second stage solve problems with far greater depth than those without. T=
his work provides a theoretical backbone for why techniques like Reinforcem=
ent Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) dramatically improve reasoning: the=
 RL step is not just fine-tuning - it=E2=80=99s fundamentally expanding the=
 model=E2=80=99s ability to utilize longer, more strategic reasoning that w=
as latent after pre-training.

StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams (Xu et al.=
, 2025) - An architecture to turn video+language models into live video int=
erpreters. As AI moves into assisting with eg. wearable cameras or robot pe=
rception, a challenge emerges: processing an unending video stream without =
infinite memory or latency. Traditional vision-language models struggle wit=
h long videos because either you use full attention (quadratic cost - impos=
sible beyond a few minutes), or a sliding window (which can break temporal =
coherence or incur redundant computations). StreamingVLM introduces a unifi=
ed framework that aligns how the model is trained with how it will inferenc=
e on streaming data. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on sho=
rt overlapping video chunks, but with a twist: at inference it maintains a =
compact memory of past context by reusing certain states rather than naivel=
y recomputing or forgetting. Specifically, it keeps a fixed-size key-value =
cache composed of three parts: (a) =E2=80=9Cattention sinks=E2=80=9D - a se=
t of latent states that aggregate long-term info, (b) a short window of rec=
ent visual frames (so it always looks at the latest few moments in full det=
ail), and (c) a longer window of recent text (so it remembers the dialogue =
or instructions). By resetting context smartly and carrying over only disti=
lled state, the model=E2=80=99s computation stays bounded even as the video=
 stream goes on indefinitely. The authors create a new benchmark with 2-hou=
r continuous videos requiring second-by-second captioning/alignment. Stream=
ingVLM achieves real-time performance (8 frames/sec on one GPU) while maint=
aining coherent understanding across the entire 2+ hour video. It beats a s=
trong baseline (GPT-4O mini) in head-to-head comparisons 66% of the time. I=
mpressively, the streaming training strategy also made the model better at =
general video QA - it boosted performance on standard long-video QA benchma=
rks by 4-6 points without any direct fine-tune on those tasks. This work pa=
ves the way for LLM-powered assistants that can watch and narrate live vide=
o nonstop, by combining sliding windows with learned memory in a principled=
, efficient manner.

Better Together: Leveraging Unpaired Multimodal Data for Stronger Unimodal =
Models (Gupta et al., 2025) - Can a vision model get better by training alo=
ngside text, even if no image is directly paired with any text? This paper =
answers yes, introducing UML (Unpaired Multimodal Learner), a training para=
digm where a single model processes different modalities in turn without on=
e-to-one alignment. The premise is that different data modalities (images, =
text, audio) are all projections of the same underlying reality - so even i=
f you don=E2=80=99t have matched pairs, a model sharing parameters across m=
odalities can learn general features that help each other. In UML, an itera=
tion might feed an image through the network, then on the next batch feed t=
ext through the same network (with modality-specific input encoders), and s=
o on, updating shared weights throughout. The authors prove under a linear =
Gaussian model that using an auxiliary modality will strictly increase the =
Fisher information about the target task, effectively reducing variance of =
the learned representation. In intuitive terms, even unpaired data from a s=
econd modality provides =E2=80=9Canother view=E2=80=9D of the world that ca=
n sharpen the model=E2=80=99s understanding of the primary modality. One st=
riking theoretical result: in some cases a single sample from an auxiliary =
modality can contribute as much as an entire additional sample of the prima=
ry modality in terms of information gain. Empirically, UML is validated on =
a wide range of benchmarks. For example, training an image classifier joint=
ly with unpaired text data yields higher accuracy than training on images a=
lone - especially on fine-grained or few-shot tests. Models trained with UM=
L also prove more robust to distribution shifts (e.g. an ImageNet model is =
sturdier against ImageNet-Sketch or -A variants if it was also trained with=
 text). The benefits extend to three modalities: adding both text and audio=
 to an image model yielded monotonic improvements. Notably, the researchers=
 quantified a =E2=80=9Cexchange rate=E2=80=9D between modalities: with cert=
ain pretrained encoders, they found 1 image =E2=89=88 228 words in terms of=
 contribution to accuracy, highlighting how aligned representations make mo=
dalities highly complementary. Overall, UML demonstrates a simple but power=
ful idea: you don=E2=80=99t need perfectly synced multimodal pairs to get m=
ultimodal benefits - just throw all the data into one model with a shared r=
epresentation, and each modality will make the others stronger.

Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When (Venhoff et al.,=
 2025) - Do larger =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D models actually acquire new r=
easoning skills, or just learn to use skills their base model already had? =
This provocative work finds evidence for the latter. So-called =E2=80=9Cthi=
nking models=E2=80=9D (like those fine-tuned with chain-of-thought or other=
 reasoning prompts) consistently outperform their base LLMs on tasks like m=
ath word problems. But the authors show you can close **=E2=89=8891% of tha=
t gap ** by non-training means: they create a hybrid setup that takes a bas=
e model and =E2=80=9Csteers=E2=80=9D its hidden activations on-the-fly usin=
g cues from a thinking model. Specifically, they identified certain interna=
l neurons or directions associated with reasoning steps (via an unsupervise=
d method to find interpretable reasoning behaviors). At inference time, nud=
ging the base model along those directions for only ~12% of the tokens is e=
nough to make it solve problems almost as well as the fully fine-tuned mode=
l - all without updating any weights. This strongly suggests the base pre-t=
rained model already contained the requisite reasoning capability; what the=
 thinking-model fine-tuning did was mainly teach the model when to deploy t=
hose capabilities. In other words, during pre-training the model learned =
=E2=80=9Chow to reason=E2=80=9D in principle, and during specialized fine-t=
uning it learned =E2=80=9Cwhen to switch into reasoning mode=E2=80=9D. This=
 reframes our understanding of chain-of-thought finetuning: it may not be a=
dding new reasoning circuits so much as scheduling the existing ones. The p=
aper=E2=80=99s results also introduce a practical method: by activating lat=
ent reasoning at the right times, a base GPT-style model can get close to a=
dvanced performance with far less cost. It=E2=80=99s an exciting validation=
 that even very large LLMs still have untapped reasoning potential that can=
 be elicited by careful prodding, rather than always needing scale or heavy=
 training.

The Markovian Thinker (Aghajohari et al., 2025) - A new paradigm to train L=
LMs for really long reasoning without blowing up compute. When we use reinf=
orcement learning to teach an LLM to do multi-step reasoning (e.g. solve a =
lengthy math proof with a series of steps), the naive approach treats the e=
ntire prompt plus all generated tokens as the state for the next token deci=
sion. This =E2=80=9CLongCoT=E2=80=9D setup means the state length keeps gro=
wing, leading to quadratic time/cost as the chain-of-thought grows. This pa=
per proposes Markovian Thinking, which redefines the environment so that th=
e model only ever conditions on a fixed-length context, regardless of how l=
ong the overall solution is. The trick is to chunk the reasoning process in=
to segments. After a segment (say 256 tokens) is generated, the environment=
 =E2=80=9Cresets=E2=80=9D - it provides the model a brief summary of what=
=E2=80=99s been done (a short carryover state) and then the model continues=
 the reasoning in a fresh context window. Essentially, the model learns to =
write a concise state representation at the end of each chunk that will all=
ow it to seamlessly pick up after the reset. They implement this in an RL e=
nvironment called Delethink (think =E2=80=9Cdelete the context, keep the es=
sential=E2=80=9D) with 8K-token chunks. A 1.5B model trained in this setup =
was able to generate coherent reasoning traces up to 24K tokens long in 8K =
contexts, matching or slightly surpassing the performance of a baseline tha=
t was trained with the full 24K context window. Because of the fixed state,=
 the compute cost grows linearly with the reasoning length instead of quadr=
atically. The authors extrapolate that extending reasoning to 96K tokens wo=
uld take ~4=C3=97 less GPU time with Markovian (7 H100-months) compared to =
standard LongCoT RL (27 H100-months). They also found that many existing LL=
Ms (from 1.5B to 120B) already sometimes output =E2=80=9CMarkovian=E2=80=9D=
 chain-of-thoughts (i.e., they naturally segment their reasoning) without a=
ny fine-tuning. This means the model can be seeded with zero-shot examples =
of the desired behavior, making RL training stable. Bottom line: by changin=
g the rules of the game (the MDP for reasoning), we can train LLMs to solve=
 very long-horizon tasks with constant memory and manageable computation - =
a promising step toward scalable =E2=80=9CSystem 2=E2=80=9D reasoning in AI=

e for LLMs (Khatri et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>Meta AI and UT=
 Austin researchers tackle the =E2=80=9Cmystery box=E2=80=9D of RL fine-tun=
ing for language models.</em><span> They conduct a 400,000 GPU-hour study a=
nd find that </span><strong>RL performance scales in a sigmoid-shaped curve=
</strong><span> (an S-curve) rather than the open-ended power-law seen in p=
re-training. Early on, gains are slow, then a phase of rapid improvement, t=
hen saturation - meaning additional compute yields diminishing returns. Cru=
cially, this predictable curve allows extrapolating a small-run=E2=80=99s r=
esults to a much larger run, bringing much-needed </span><strong>predictabi=
lity to RL</strong><span> for LLMs. The authors identify that not all RL =
=E2=80=9Crecipes=E2=80=9D reach the same performance ceiling: some fine-tun=
ing strategies plateau higher than others. They also observe that many desi=
gn details (loss functions, advantage normalization, data curriculum, off-p=
olicy vs on-policy updates) mainly affect </span><strong>compute efficiency=
</strong><span> (how fast reward improves) without changing the ultimate ac=
hievable reward. By combining the best choices from their ablations, they p=
ropose a </span><strong>=E2=80=9CScaleRL=E2=80=9D recipe</strong><span> of =
best practices (e.g. using an asynchronous pipeline, a stable loss function=
 called CISPO, FP32 precision at the output layer, adaptive prompt curricul=
a). ScaleRL produced near-ideal sigmoid scaling behavior, allowing a single=
 RL run up to 100k GPU-hours to hit predicted performance targets. </span><=
strong>Key takeaway:</strong><span> RL fine-tuning can be transformed from =
trial-and-error art into a more exact science - labs can now forecast how m=
uch reward improvement an extra 10=C3=97 compute will bring, potentially sa=
ving time and compute.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"=

</strong><span> - </span><em>A bold proposal for a new programming paradigm=
 that bridges deep learning and logic.</em><span> This paper introduces </s=
pan><strong>tensor logic</strong><span>, a minimal yet expressive language =
designed to serve as a common foundation for neural networks, symbolic reas=
oning, and probabilistic models. The </span><strong>sole programming constr=
uct is the =E2=80=9Ctensor equation=E2=80=9D</strong><span>, based on the i=
nsight that logical inference rules can be viewed as tensor operations (Ein=
stein summation) on Boolean tensors. In practice, tensor logic treats relat=
ions (as in logic programs) as sparse tensors, and logical rules (like in D=
atalog) correspond to performing joins and summations on those tensors foll=
owed by non-linearities. This means that a </span><em>transformer attention=
 head, a Prolog rule, a kernel machine, or a factor graph</em><span> can al=
l be written in the same tensor equation language. By leveraging modern aut=
odiff and GPU compute (similar to PyTorch/TensorFlow), tensor logic promise=
s to support </span><strong>learning and reasoning in one framework</strong=
><span>. For example, it could enable =E2=80=9Csound reasoning in embedding=
 space,=E2=80=9D combining neural nets=E2=80=99 pattern recognition with th=
e rigor of logical rules. The author demonstrates how various AI models (ML=
Ps, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, symbolic logic programs, graphical models) ca=
n be concisely expressed in tensor logic. If widely adopted, this unified l=
anguage could eliminate the divide between differentiable AI and symbolic A=
I, offering both the scalability of tensors and the transparency of logic i=
n a single system.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"posi=

ll-in-One RAG Framework (Guo et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>Exte=
nding retrieval-augmented LLMs beyond text.</em><span> Retrieval-Augmented =
Generation (RAG) typically allows an LLM to fetch textual documents to over=
come knowledge cutoff. However, </span><strong>knowledge in the real world =
is multimodal</strong><span> - images, tables, charts, math equations - and=
 current RAG systems handle primarily text, missing a lot. This work presen=
ts </span><strong>RAG-Anything</strong><span>, a framework enabling LLMs to=
 retrieve and reason over </span><em>any modality</em><span>. The key idea =
is to represent multimodal content (text, visuals, audio, etc.) as intercon=
nected knowledge </span><strong>graphs</strong><span> rather than separate =
data silos. RAG-Anything builds a </span><strong>dual-graph representation<=
/strong><span> of a knowledge base: one graph captures cross-modal relation=
ships (e.g. an image and its caption or a table and its description), while=
 another captures textual semantic similarity. It then performs a </span><s=
trong>cross-modal hybrid retrieval</strong><span> that combines structural =
navigation (following links/relationships in the graph) with semantic match=
ing (embedding-based search). This allows the system to fetch evidence that=
 spans multiple modalities in a coherent way. The authors report that RAG-A=
nything </span><strong>significantly outperforms text-only retrieval</stron=
g><span> on challenging multimodal QA benchmarks. Gains are especially larg=
e for long documents that include mixtures of text and figures, where tradi=
tional RAG fails to gather the relevant pieces. By eliminating the modality=
-specific fragmentation in knowledge access, this unified approach lets LLM=
s use images, diagrams, tables, etc. as seamlessly as text. </span><em>(The=
 code is open-sourced, signaling a push toward truly multimodal chat assist=
ants.)</em></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative=

Zhang et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>A new training paradigm fro=
m Meta=E2=80=99s AI lab for language agents to bootstrap themselves.</em><s=
pan> Modern LLM-based agents often rely on imitation learning from human de=
monstrations because true reinforcement learning is hard without well-defin=
ed rewards or requires huge trial-and-error rollouts. This paper proposes <=
/span><strong>=E2=80=9Cearly experience=E2=80=9D</strong><span> as a middle=
 ground: let the agent loose to interact with the environment </span><em>wi=
thout</em><span> external rewards, and use the resulting states as self-sup=
ervision signals. In essence, the agent generates its own trajectories (eve=
n if suboptimal) and learns from them in two ways: </span><strong>(1) Impli=
cit world modeling</strong><span> - predicting the future state transitions=
 it will see, to internalize the environment=E2=80=99s dynamics. And </span=
><strong>(2) self-reflection</strong><span> - analyzing its own actions by =
generating natural language explanations of what went wrong or could be imp=
roved, thereby refining its decision policy. Crucially, all this learning h=
appens </span><em>without any reward function</em><span>, purely from the a=
gent=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cexperience=E2=80=9D of cause and effect. Across eig=
ht diverse tasks (web browsing, tool use, navigation, etc.), agents bootstr=
apped with early experience data </span><strong>outperform those trained on=
ly on expert demos</strong><span>, showing better generalization to new sit=
uations. For instance, an agent that had a chance to </span><em>practice</e=
m><span> in an environment, even without rewards, later performs more robus=
tly than one that only imitated fixed expert trajectories. Moreover, when a=
ctual rewards are available, starting from early experience gives a head-st=
art - these agents offer a strong foundation for subsequent RL fine-tuning.=
 This paradigm thus bridges the gap between purely imitation-based agents a=
nd fully autonomous RL agents, suggesting that even =E2=80=9Creward-free=E2=
=80=9D interaction can substantially improve an AI=E2=80=99s competence and=
 adaptability.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position=

ction Facilitates Learning (Tsilivis et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span>=
<em>A deep dive into the mechanics of fine-tuning LLMs with RL on reasoning=
 tasks.</em><span> Recent breakthroughs in mathematical and logical reasoni=
ng by LLMs have relied on a recipe: first pre-train on next-token predictio=
n, then fine-tune with RL (e.g. optimizing a reward for correct answers). T=
his paper asks </span><em>why</em><span> the RL stage is so effective. The =
authors develop a theoretical framework using a toy parity bit task and pro=
ve that </span><strong>RL fine-tuning enables generalization that next-toke=
n training alone cannot achieve without exponentially more data or compute<=
/strong><span>. The intuition is that an RL objective can </span><strong>le=
verage longer chain-of-thoughts at test time</strong><span> - effectively l=
etting the model use additional computation (by generating longer explanati=
ons/steps) to solve a task. In their setup, the training data is a mixture =
of short and long reasoning sequences (e.g. mostly short explanations with =
a few long detailed ones). They show mathematically that an autoregressive =
model trained only by imitation (next-token) struggles to learn the rare lo=
ng dependencies. But if you then apply RL that rewards correct final answer=
s, the model </span><strong>learns to use the occasional long chain-of-thou=
ght to get those answers right</strong><span>, even when such long examples=
 were sparse in the data. Essentially, RL fine-tuning teaches the model </s=
pan><em>when to deploy</em><span> a long reasoning chain. The authors prove=
, in a simplified linear model, that as long as a </span><em>non-negligible=
</em><span> fraction of long trajectories exist, this two-stage training ef=
ficiently learns the underlying task, whereas next-token learning would nee=
d an impractical amount of long examples. They confirm these phenomena on r=
eal LLMs (LLaMA models) on math reasoning benchmarks: models with an RL sec=
ond stage solve problems with far greater depth than those without. This wo=
rk provides a theoretical backbone for why techniques like Reinforcement Le=
arning from Human Feedback (RLHF) dramatically improve reasoning: </span><s=
trong>the RL step is not just fine-tuning - it=E2=80=99s fundamentally expa=
nding the model=E2=80=99s ability to utilize longer, more strategic reasoni=
ng that was latent after pre-training</strong><span>.</span></p><h2 class=

reams (Xu et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>An architecture to turn=
 video+language models into live video interpreters.</em><span> As AI moves=
 into assisting with eg. wearable cameras or robot perception, a challenge =
emerges: </span><strong>processing an unending video stream without infinit=
e memory or latency</strong><span>. Traditional vision-language models stru=
ggle with long videos because either you use full attention (quadratic cost=
 - impossible beyond a few minutes), or a sliding window (which can break t=
emporal coherence or incur redundant computations). StreamingVLM introduces=
 a unified framework that aligns how the model is </span><em>trained</em><s=
pan> with how it will </span><em>inference on streaming data</em><span>. Th=
e model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on short overlapping video ch=
unks, but with a twist: at inference it maintains a </span><strong>compact =
memory of past context</strong><span> by </span><strong>reusing</strong><sp=
an> certain states rather than naively recomputing or forgetting. Specifica=
lly, it keeps a </span><strong>fixed-size key-value cache</strong><span> co=
mposed of three parts: (a) =E2=80=9Cattention sinks=E2=80=9D - a set of lat=
ent states that aggregate long-term info, (b) a short window of recent </sp=
an><em>visual frames</em><span> (so it always looks at the latest few momen=
ts in full detail), and (c) a longer window of recent </span><em>text</em><=
span> (so it remembers the dialogue or instructions). By resetting context =
smartly and carrying over only distilled state, the model=E2=80=99s computa=
tion stays bounded even as the video stream goes on indefinitely. The autho=
rs create a new benchmark with 2-hour continuous videos requiring second-by=
-second captioning/alignment. StreamingVLM achieves </span><strong>real-tim=
e performance (8 frames/sec on one GPU) while maintaining coherent understa=
nding across the entire 2+ hour video</strong><span>. It beats a strong bas=
eline (GPT-4O mini) in head-to-head comparisons 66% of the time. Impressive=
ly, the streaming training strategy also made the model better at general v=
ideo QA - it boosted performance on standard long-video QA benchmarks by 4-=
6 points without any direct fine-tune on those tasks. This work paves the w=
ay for LLM-powered assistants that can </span><em>watch and narrate live vi=
deo</em><span> nonstop, by combining sliding windows with learned memory in=
 a principled, efficient manner.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post"=

ter Together: Leveraging Unpaired Multimodal Data for Stronger Unimodal Mod=
els (Gupta et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>Can a vision model get=
 better by training alongside text, even if no image is directly paired wit=
h any text?</em><span> This paper answers yes, introducing </span><strong>U=
ML (Unpaired Multimodal Learner)</strong><span>, a training paradigm where =
a single model processes different modalities in turn without one-to-one al=
ignment. The premise is that different data modalities (images, text, audio=
) are all projections of the same underlying reality - so even if you don=
=E2=80=99t have matched pairs, a model sharing parameters across modalities=
 can learn general features that help each other. In UML, an iteration migh=
t feed an image through the network, then on the next batch feed text throu=
gh the </span><em>same network (with modality-specific input encoders)</em>=
<span>, and so on, updating shared weights throughout. The authors prove un=
der a linear Gaussian model that using an auxiliary modality will </span><s=
trong>strictly increase the Fisher information</strong><span> about the tar=
get task, effectively reducing variance of the learned representation. In i=
ntuitive terms, even unpaired data from a second modality provides =E2=80=
=9Canother view=E2=80=9D of the world that can sharpen the model=E2=80=99s =
understanding of the primary modality. One striking theoretical result: in =
some cases a </span><em>single</em><span> sample from an auxiliary modality=
 can contribute as much as an entire additional sample of the primary modal=
ity in terms of information gain. Empirically, UML is validated on a wide r=
ange of benchmarks. For example, training an image classifier jointly with =
unpaired text data yields higher accuracy than training on images alone - e=
specially on fine-grained or few-shot tests. Models trained with UML also p=
rove more </span><strong>robust to distribution shifts</strong><span> (e.g.=
 an ImageNet model is sturdier against ImageNet-Sketch or -A variants if it=
 was also trained with text). The benefits extend to </span><em>three modal=
ities</em><span>: adding both text and audio to an image model yielded mono=
tonic improvements. Notably, the researchers quantified a =E2=80=9Cexchange=
 rate=E2=80=9D between modalities: with certain pretrained encoders, they f=
ound </span><em>1 image =E2=89=88 228 words</em><span> in terms of contribu=
tion to accuracy, highlighting how aligned representations make modalities =
highly complementary. Overall, </span><strong>UML demonstrates a simple but=
 powerful idea</strong><span>: you don=E2=80=99t need perfectly synced mult=
imodal pairs to get multimodal benefits - just throw all the data into one =
model with a shared representation, and each modality will make the others =
stronger.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: rel=

en (Venhoff et al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>Do larger =E2=80=9Cth=
inking=E2=80=9D models actually acquire new reasoning skills, or just learn=
 to use skills their base model already had?</em><span> This provocative wo=
rk finds evidence for the latter. So-called =E2=80=9Cthinking models=E2=80=
=9D (like those fine-tuned with chain-of-thought or other reasoning prompts=
) consistently outperform their base LLMs on tasks like math word problems.=
 But the authors show you can close **=E2=89=8891% of that gap ** by </span=
><em>non-training means</em><span>: they create a </span><strong>hybrid set=
up that takes a base model and =E2=80=9Csteers=E2=80=9D its hidden activati=
ons on-the-fly</strong><span> using cues from a thinking model. Specificall=
y, they identified certain internal neurons or directions associated with r=
easoning steps (via an unsupervised method to find interpretable reasoning =
behaviors). At inference time, nudging the base model along those direction=
s for only ~12% of the tokens is enough to make it solve problems almost as=
 well as the fully fine-tuned model - all </span><strong>without updating a=
ny weights</strong><span>. This strongly suggests the base pre-trained mode=

 during pre-training the model learned =E2=80=9Chow to reason=E2=80=9D in p=
rinciple, and during specialized fine-tuning it learned =E2=80=9Cwhen to sw=
itch into reasoning mode=E2=80=9D. This reframes our understanding of chain=
-of-thought finetuning: it may not be adding new reasoning circuits so much=
 as scheduling the existing ones. The paper=E2=80=99s results also introduc=
e a practical method: by activating latent reasoning at the right times, a =
base GPT-style model can get </span><em>close</em><span> to advanced perfor=
mance with far less cost. It=E2=80=99s an exciting validation that even ver=
y large LLMs still have untapped reasoning potential that can be elicited b=

al., 2025)</strong><span> - </span><em>A new paradigm to train LLMs for rea=
lly long reasoning without blowing up compute.</em><span> When we use reinf=
orcement learning to teach an LLM to do multi-step reasoning (e.g. solve a =
lengthy math proof with a series of steps), the naive approach treats the e=
ntire prompt plus all generated tokens as the state for the next token deci=
sion. This =E2=80=9CLongCoT=E2=80=9D setup means the </span><strong>state l=
ength keeps growing</strong><span>, leading to quadratic time/cost as the c=
hain-of-thought grows. This paper proposes </span><strong>Markovian Thinkin=
g</strong><span>, which redefines the environment so that the model only ev=
er conditions on a </span><em>fixed-length context</em><span>, regardless o=
f how long the overall solution is. The trick is to </span><strong>chunk th=
e reasoning process</strong><span> into segments. After a segment (say 256 =
tokens) is generated, the environment =E2=80=9Cresets=E2=80=9D - it provide=
s the model a brief summary of what=E2=80=99s been done (a short carryover =
state) and then the model continues the reasoning in a fresh context window=
. Essentially, the model learns to </span><strong>write a concise state rep=
resentation at the end of each chunk</strong><span> that will allow it to s=
eamlessly pick up after the reset. They implement this in an RL environment=
 called </span><em>Delethink</em><span> (think =E2=80=9Cdelete the context,=
 keep the essential=E2=80=9D) with 8K-token chunks. A 1.5B model trained in=
 this setup was able to generate coherent reasoning traces </span><strong>u=
p to 24K tokens long in 8K contexts</strong><span>, matching or slightly su=
rpassing the performance of a baseline that was trained with the full 24K c=
ontext window. Because of the fixed state, the </span><strong>compute cost =
grows linearly</strong><span> with the reasoning length instead of quadrati=
cally. The authors extrapolate that extending reasoning to 96K tokens would=
 take </span><strong>~4=C3=97 less GPU time</strong><span> with Markovian (=
7 H100-months) compared to standard LongCoT RL (27 H100-months). They also =
found that many existing LLMs (from 1.5B to 120B) </span><em>already</em><s=
pan> sometimes output =E2=80=9CMarkovian=E2=80=9D chain-of-thoughts (i.e., =
they naturally segment their reasoning) without any fine-tuning. This means=
 the model can be seeded with zero-shot examples of the desired behavior, m=
aking RL training stable. </span><strong>Bottom line:</strong><span> by cha=
nging the rules of the game (the MDP for reasoning), we can train LLMs to s=
olve very long-horizon tasks with constant memory and manageable computatio=
n - a promising step toward scalable =E2=80=9CSystem 2=E2=80=9D reasoning i=
