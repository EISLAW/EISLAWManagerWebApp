Every once in a while, technology hits an inflection point so powerful that=
 it transforms how we build, how we create, and how we deliver value. AI-po=
wered coding tools are exactly that kind of breakthrough=E2=80=94an inflect=
ion point reshaping the core practice of software development. But beneath =
the hype and the overwhelming flood of new tools, real clarity about how to=
 actually use AI effectively has been hard to find. Until now.
Over the past year, I=E2=80=99ve immersed myself in the messy, exciting rea=
lity of building software with AI. I=E2=80=99ve written about it [ https://=
substack.com/redirect/7af8c5d1-5a2e-42d0-aa12-3c3921118ddb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWti=
OTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. I=E2=80=99ve closely=
 observed how top industry leaders=E2=80=94from indie hackers rapidly spinn=
ing up MVPs, to seasoned engineering managers guiding teams at scale=E2=80=
=94are practically integrating these tools into their daily workflows. What=
 I=E2=80=99ve discovered is that the most successful AI users aren=E2=80=99=
t those chasing the latest shiny tool, but rather those who=E2=80=99ve adop=
ted durable, battle-tested patterns. Patterns that consistently deliver rea=
l results, survive hype cycles, and meaningfully accelerate their developme=
nt work.
The problem is no one has been actually naming those patterns as a durable =
basis for AI-powered development. Until now.
This guide is a comprehensive synthesis of everything I=E2=80=99ve learned.=
 At its heart are six proven workflows that I=E2=80=99ve seen deliver repea=
tedly across teams, companies, and projects. You=E2=80=99ll get clear expla=
nations of each pattern, real-world examples of how industry leaders are pu=
tting them into practice, and honest explorations of the pitfalls they=E2=
=80=99ve faced along the way. To make it immediately useful, I=E2=80=99ve a=
lso included extensive notes on which tools excel at specific tasks, where =
tools tend to fail, and practical guidelines for avoiding common traps.
I didn=E2=80=99t just research this=E2=80=94I lived it. Each insight and re=
commendation you=E2=80=99ll read comes from hands-on experimentation and fr=
om hundreds of hours of observing, questioning, and learning directly from =
builders at the forefront. You=E2=80=99ll get a peek at their workflows as =
well as my own experiences, along with a comprehensive 52 page guide coveri=
ng AI-powered development traps, pitfalls, and success patterns at all scal=
es (from indie hacker to enterprise).=20
For AI consultants: this one is big! So many companies are wondering how to=
 configure and set up their AI development workflows. This guide is intende=
d to be a foundational guide for that work.
My goal is straightforward: to equip you with the clearest, most actionable=
 resource available on effectively using AI coding tools right now, in mid-=
2025. Whether you=E2=80=99re a seasoned engineer aiming to scale productivi=
ty, a product leader looking for competitive leverage, or someone completel=
y new to AI and wondering where to start, you=E2=80=99ll find proven strate=
gies and clear pathways to immediate value here. And the workflows I base t=
hese on aren=E2=80=99t going anywhere! If ChatGPT-5 comes out this week, we=
=E2=80=99ll just slot that right into the workflows we=E2=80=99ve already e=
stablished here.
We=E2=80=99re standing at a pivotal moment. AI is a practical developer rea=
lity reshaping what=E2=80=99s possible. In particular, I want to call out t=
hat the leaders whose work I am diving into as an example show what=E2=80=
=99s possible in the age of AI=E2=80=94they are not all (or even mostly) tr=
ained CS engineers. Some are. Some are not. All of them have been able to s=
hip and deliver with AI.=20
My hope is that this guide serves as a useful compass, helping you confiden=
tly navigate through the noise (regardless of your experience level) toward=
 real productivity and innovation. Let=E2=80=99s dive in and explore how th=
ese durable workflows can supercharge your development, save you time, and =
open up entirely new creative possibilities.=20
And I hope this gets you excited to build! It has never been a better time =
to build=E2=80=A6

Comprehensive Synthesis of AI Coding Tools: Usage, Pitfalls, and Proven Wor=
k Patterns
First, how this works:=20
I=E2=80=99ve created a complete 52 page guide to give you a reference for A=
I-powered development in mid-2025. In addition, I=E2=80=99ve gone above and=
 beyond to coalesce all this learning into six durable workflows. Those won=
=E2=80=99t change, even as tools come in and out of fashion (or hype).=20
So I spend most of the article below talking about those workflows and lead=
ers you can follow to learn more about how to work with AI tooling (yes eve=
n if you=E2=80=99re new). And the 52 page guide? That=E2=80=99s right there=
 as a Google doc whenever you want to dive deep. It includes comprehensive =
tool profiles across roughly a dozen AI powered development tools, extensiv=
e pros and cons, and my own notes from playing with all these tools.=20
You can get the 52 page guide in Google Docs here [ https://substack.com/re=
direct/496533c8-ce21-4a5a-afbe-9180bcee8d1f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88Y=
FxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Overall, my goal has been to create the most comprehensive, actionable guid=
e available on how industry leaders actually use AI coding tools to create =
value. This isn't theoretical=E2=80=94it's based on real workflows, documen=
ted pitfalls, and battle-tested patterns that deliver measurable results. M=
y goal is to give you everything you need to understand the principles, see=
 specific tools and examples, recognize the traps, and apply these insights=
 directly to accelerate your own development work.
Still reading? Here=E2=80=99s how I've organized this Substack guide for ma=
ximum usefulness:
Part 1: Proven Work Patterns =E2=80=93 Six battle-tested approaches that co=
nsistently deliver results, complete with real examples from industry leade=
rs, integrated pitfalls to avoid, and step-by-step application principles. =
This shows you exactly how these patterns work in practice.
Part 2: Leader-Specific Workflows and Pitfalls =E2=80=93 Detailed breakdown=
s of how specific leaders use these tools, organized alphabetically. You'll=
 see their exact workflows, understand why they work, learn from their mist=
akes, and understand the scale they operate at. This gives you proven playb=
ooks to adapt.
Part 3: Tool-Specific Overviews =E2=80=93 A practical cross-reference table=
 of all the major tools, showing their strengths, weaknesses, and optimal u=
se cases based on real-world experience. This helps you choose the right to=
ol for your specific needs.
Part 4: General Principles and Application Guide =E2=80=93 Distilled wisdom=
 (like a cheat sheet) that you can implement immediately, including essenti=
al cautions and a reality check on what AI can and cannot do for your codin=
g workflow.
And of course, if you want to go deeper there=E2=80=99s always that 52 page=
 report!
Every detail comes from documented real-world experience. Where relevant, I=
 connect patterns to specific leader examples and tie pitfalls to particula=

Part 1: Proven Work Patterns
These six patterns represent battle-tested approaches from the past year (u=
p to 2025), focusing on boosting velocity while maintaining quality. Each i=
ncludes: description, strengths, examples from leaders, integrated pitfalls=
, tools involved, and application principles. Patterns are not autopilot=E2=
=80=94human oversight is essential, as evidenced by cautionary tales of slo=
wdowns from poor implementation (e.g., 19% development slowdown in one mid-=
size company due to lack of guidelines).
Pattern 1: Codebase Mapping & Onboarding
Description: Use AI to quickly understand existing codebases, generating ma=
ps, summaries, or graphs for onboarding or legacy dives. Treat AI output as=
 a starting point for refinement.
Strengths: Accelerates onboarding from weeks to days; extracts high-level c=
ontext fast; useful for non-engineers.
Examples from Leaders:
Claire Vo [ https://substack.com/redirect/7aae8e5a-20ef-405d-8b04-457f1b1e2=
857?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] u=
ses Devin for initial repo analysis and refactor assessment in production c=
odebases, generating PRs/tests with ~80% success on first try, chaining to =
Cursor for local edits.
CJ Zafir [ https://substack.com/redirect/e96be2e9-61b6-4dcd-b518-128d0dab43=

ads PRD/plans into Cursor's .cursorrules for persistent context, using Gemi=
ni 2.5 for scanning large codebases.
Eric Provencher [ https://substack.com/redirect/8180bd78-842e-431a-88c5-13d=

] uses Windsurf's Cascade for auto-context in large/proprietary codebases.
Simon Willison [ https://substack.com/redirect/13381990-5154-4fdf-92b1-6c50=
2bbbbb33?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw=
0 ] uses Claude Code's /onboard for GitHub Actions context.
Pitfalls: AI won't grasp every nuance (e.g., Windsurf's poor context for in=
terconnected codebases per Orosz); double-check findings to avoid trust ero=
sion (e.g., Cursor's hallucinations in monorepos per Zafir). General source=
s note context length limits causing inconsistencies in large projects (e.g=
=2E, Replit AI loops errors).
Tools Involved: Claude Code (excels at architectural summaries), Aider (gre=
p/questions), Devin (repo analysis), Cursor (persistent rules), Windsurf (C=
ascade).
Application Principles: Point AI at repo; prompt for summaries/graphs; refi=
ne manually. Start with small repos; update context files regularly. For te=
ams, share AI-generated docs for collaborative onboarding.
Pattern 2: Planning-First Development
Description: Use AI as an "architect" to outline plans (functions, logic, e=
dge cases) before code generation; approve/refine then proceed. Simulates p=
seudocode or design docs.
Strengths: Prevents tangential outputs; ensures coherence/maintainability; =
doubles as documentation.
Examples from Leaders:
CJ Zafir asks Cursor for approaches/plans, generates action lists, builds i=
n chunks; uses o3-mini for 40-step plans.
Dan Shipper [ https://substack.com/redirect/7ed4d734-7251-40c6-9ad9-38f74a5=
b05ea?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
 sets up opponent processors in Claude Code for parallel sub-agents with op=
posing goals, synthesizing outputs in long runs.
Eric Provencher delegates planning to o3 via chat, then Claude applies edit=
s.
Gergely Orosz uses Plan Mode in Claude Code/Codex CLI for roadmaps, sub-age=
nts for parallel tasks.
Peter Yang [ https://substack.com/redirect/6cda77df-3e92-40e0-aa52-f4c8380f=
fd7d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] =
demos 3 agents in Claude Code with custom commands like "think ultra hard" =
for quality plans.
Riley Brown [ https://substack.com/redirect/6ac51632-4e41-4b33-ad4f-10c81ea=
f11b8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
 uses Cursor Composer for planning/diagram phases (e.g., 3min planning).
Pitfalls: Without planning, outputs can be verbose/wrong (e.g., Claude's th=
rottling in high-load per Shipper); model refusals (e.g., Claude quirks per=
 Provencher). Zafir notes Windsurf breaks after initial steps.
Tools Involved: Claude Code (built-in Plan Mode), Cursor (action lists), o3=
 (detailed plans), Windsurf (planning mode with rules).
Application Principles: Prompt for breakdown first ("sketch solution design=
"); approve before coding. Use for complex features/refactoring; feed plans=
 into other tools. Enforce via tool modes or habits to avoid backtracking.
Pattern 3: NL-Driven Coding ("Vibe Coding")
Description: Prompt in natural language for code generation; iterate for re=
finements. Ideal for prototypes/scripts/exploration.
Strengths: Speed for rapid drafts; zero-setup in some tools; enables non-co=
ders.
Examples from Leaders:
Riley Brown uses Cursor for 100% AI workflow (e.g., YouTube analytics tool =
in 1h via prompts for APIs/styling); Replit AI for idea-to-deploy (e.g., CR=
M UI in one prompt).
Melvin Vivas prompts Windsurf for deploys/PRs, switching to Gemini for UI.
Peter Yang types app descriptions in Claude Code for agent builds.
CJ Zafir prompts Cursor for tweaks, v0 for UI.
Pitfalls: Ambiguous prompts lead to off-base/insecure code (e.g., Replit's =
overkill client/server per general sources); style mismatches without guide=
lines. Vo notes Windsurf's bugs in agent mode post-acquisition.
Tools Involved: Replit AI (Ghostwriter for CRUD), Lovable (multi-agent canv=
as), Cursor (inline edits), Claude Code (prompt-based).
Application Principles: Describe clearly ("create Express.js app with...");=
 review for security/style. Start small; iterate prompts. Pair with plannin=
g for larger tasks to avoid over-engineering.
Pattern 4: AI-Augmented Debugging & Testing
Description: Involve AI when issues arise; analyze errors, suggest fixes, l=
oop until resolved. Automates fix-run cycles.
Strengths: Spots obvious bugs fast; generates tests; reduces root-cause tim=
e.
Examples from Leaders:
Claire Vo uses Devin for debugging with Datadog, generating tests with huma=
n review.
Riley Brown uses Cursor's terminal access for API setups, fixing via diffs.
Simon Willison reviews commits file-by-file in Claude Code.
Pitfalls: May introduce regressions (e.g., hardcoded fixes per document cau=
tion); logical bugs need humans (e.g., Windsurf stopping mid-session per Za=
fir). General sources note Devin underperforms in messy repos.
Tools Involved: Cursor (Bug Fixer diffs), Devin (autonomous loops), Claude =
Code (error explanations).
Application Principles: Paste error traces; prompt "suggest fix"; apply dif=
fs cautiously. Sandbox for automation; verify with tests. Use for syntax/da=
ta issues; escalate architecture to humans.
Pattern 5: AI-Assisted Code Reviews & Refactoring
Description: Use AI as pre-PR reviewer; prompt for feedback/improvements; a=
utomate refactors with oversight.
Strengths: Catches low-hanging issues; accelerates migrations; reduces huma=
n burden.
Examples from Leaders:
Claire Vo chains Devin to ChatPRD for PRs, Cursor for surgical changes.
Gergely Orosz uses Cursor/Windsurf for inline edits in rollouts.
Simon Willison commits file-by-file after review in Claude Code.
Pitfalls: Blind trust causes regressions (e.g., Cursor edits outside scope =
per Zafir, removing params 300 lines away); complexity leads to untangling =
(document example of week-long fixes). Orosz notes hallucinations in edits.
Tools Involved: Claude Code (diff reviews), Devin (migrations), Cursor (ref=
actors).
Application Principles: Prompt "review this code"; keep refactors small. In=
tegrate with CI bots; human final-sign. Ideal for style/consistency; test t=
horoughly post-refactor.
Pattern 6: Context Engineering & Consistency Enforcement
Description: Maintain AI-readable files (e.g., CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) wit=
h guidelines; prepend to prompts for on-target outputs.
Strengths: Reduces drift/hallucinations; reinforces best practices; compoun=
ds benefits.
Examples from Leaders:
CJ Zafir uses .cursorrules in Cursor for style/do's-don'ts.
Eric Provencher uses CLAUDE.md in RepoPrompt for priming.
Gergely Orosz uses MCP for context limits.
Melvin Vivas uses Cascade for auto-context.
Pitfalls: Neglect leads to inconsistencies/security mistakes (e.g., Claude =
forgetfulness after breaks per Provencher); extra maintenance work. General=
 sources note context loss in long sessions.
Tools Involved: Cursor (.cursorrules), Claude Code (CLAUDE.md), Windsurf (C=
ascade).
Application Principles: Create root files with principles/examples; update =
regularly. Sync across tools; treat AI like a team member. Monitor for drif=
ts; invest for sustained gains.
Note on the Launch of Claude Code Subagents: In June 2025, Anthropic launch=
ed subagents for Claude Code (now part of Claude Projects), enabling multi-=
agent workflows like opponent processors or parallel task agents directly i=
n the interface. This builds on prompt-based setups (e.g., Shipper's and Ya=
ng's examples), adding native support for compounding agents with shared co=
ntext, reducing manual orchestration. Early adopters report improved handli=
ng of complex tasks but note increased costs and occasional synchronization=
 bugs in beta.
Part 2: Leader-Specific Workflows and Pitfalls
This is a second view of the tool-focused view above, focused on per-leader=
 notes. Keep in mind these leaders themselves are publicly evolving their s=
tacks as AI changes, so don=E2=80=99t be surprised to hear about updates as=
 they begin to shift where they focus. As an example, a number of them have=
 shifted publicly from Cursor to Claude Code recently. Notice the same work=
flows remain, it=E2=80=99s just the tools that shift!
Claire Vo (CPO at multiple ventures; scales async teams; hybrid flows)
Tool: Devin (with ChatPRD and Cursor)
Workflow Details: Starts with Devin for repo analysis/refactor, generates P=
Rs/tests (~80% success), chains to ChatPRD for PRDs/Linear tickets, then Cu=
rsor for local edits/branches. Why works: Reduces async friction, cancels j=
unior hires. Example: Debugging with Datadog. Scale: Multi-venture delegati=
on in hours.
Tool: Windsurf
Pitfalls Details: Backed off due to post-acquisition (Cognition, July 2025)=
 chaos=E2=80=94talent drain, IP uncertainties, bugs in agent mode (stopping=
 mid-session, resets), inconsistent context in large repos. Why fails: Prio=
ritizes Devin integration. Example: Throttling/lag under load. Scale: Erode=
s trust for production, delays roadmaps.
CJ Zafir (Independent developer; scales rapid MVPs; benchmarks)
Tool: Cursor (with v0 and Claude Code)

nsistencies in chained retrievals. Why fails: Cost ($200/mo Max), 1-line in=
put annoying (Alt+Enter). Example: Overly verbose/wrong like Gemini CLI.
Eric Provencher (Founder of RepoPrompt; scales prompt optimization; hybrid =
flows)
Tool: Claude Code (with o3 and RepoPrompt)
Workflow Details: Primes with /onboard or CLAUDE.md, delegates planning to =
o3 for plans/pseudo-code, Claude edits/verifies with MCP; o3 via desktop vi=
deos, auto mode. Why works: Second-order prompting, cheaper drivers. Exampl=
e: Structured XML edits. Scale: $20/mo optimizations.
Pitfalls Details: Forgetfulness after breaks, no persistent memory, lacks m=
onorepo comprehension. Why fails: Model refuses requests, throttles under l=
oad. Scale: Pricing barrier for hobbyists.
Gergely Orosz (Engineering manager/author; scales enterprise insights; real=
ity checks)
Tool: Claude Code and Codex CLI
Workflow Details: Groups as similar for agentic: Plan Mode for roadmaps, su=
b-agents for parallel (frontend/backend), iterative docs; filter:replies mi=
n_replies:10 for patterns. Why works: Negate filters, MCP for limits. Scale=
: Surveys 1000+ engineers, 41% adoption.
Pitfalls Details: Stripped-down (Codex lesser), no transparency when stuck,=
 context limits for large, error loops. Why fails: Refuses offensive langua=
ge, not monorepos. Example: Mediocre on Bubble.io.
Tool: Cursor and Windsurf
Workflow Details: Rollout: Cursor for inline/composer in VS Code, Windsurf =
for Cascade in large repos; min_faves:10 for patterns. Why works: Training =
maximizes 30% human input, open-source customization. Scale: 41% adoption w=
ith oversight.
Pitfalls Details: Lags VS Code updates/bugs (keybindings/sync), poor contex=
t for interconnected, hallucinations. Why fails: Not production-ready, pric=

aper.
Melvin Vivas (AI backend builder; scales courses; model switching)
Tool: Windsurf (with Gemini)
Workflow Details: Fixes UI with Gemini when Sonnet fails, Cascade for conte=
xt, workflows for deploys/PRs. Why works: Affordability, indexing prevents =
hallucinations. Example: Styled PRs. Scale: Courses for 1000s, non-web to p=
hone with Expo.
Pitfalls Details: Unusable post-price hike (converts to Python, awful auto-=
complete), insufficient cascade (500/month). Why fails: Queue awful, agent =
stopping. Scale: Fails long sessions.
Tool: AmpCode
Workflow Details: In VS Code/Cursor/CLI with $10 credits for context edits,=
 pay-per-use. Why works: Versatile, transparent no subs. Scale: Integrates =
with Warp for full-stack planning/commit.
Peter Yang (Product at Roblox; scales PM; agentic tutorials)
Tool: Claude Code
Workflow Details: Demos 3 agents: manager/team with slash commands (/onboar=
d, ultrathink), start simple. Why works: Compounding saves hours, MCP for c=
onnections. Example: App builds in 30min. Scale: 125K readers learn agentic=
=2E
Pitfalls Details: 1-line box annoying (Alt+Enter), high cost ($200/mo). Why=
 fails: Throttling high-load, no persistent memory. Scale: Fails long-term.
Riley Brown (Podcast host; scales non-coder apps; wrappers/prototypes)
Tool: Cursor (with terminal)
Workflow Details: 100% AI: Composer for multi-file, terminal for APIs (Supa=

s, commit file-by-file; --dangerously-skip-permission with cautions. Why wo=
rks: MCP for tools, thoughtful design. Scale: "In the zone" despite rustine=
ss.
Pitfalls Details: Unintuitive newline (Alt+Enter wastes time), cost barrier=
=2E Why fails: Verbose/wrong, forgetful=
ness. Example: Terrible if alt-enter h=
eavy.
Part 3: Tool-Specific Overviews
This cross-references usages and pitfalls for quick reference.
Part 4: General Principles and Application Guide
New to coding? Here=E2=80=99s a cheat sheet:
First, Select Patterns: Match to needs (e.g., onboarding for legacies, vibe=
 for prototypes).
Then, Choose Tools: Based on scale (Cursor for MVPs, Claude for planning).
Keep in Mind Key Principles Across All Flows:
Human in loop (review/30% input)
Context files (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md)
Start small/iterate
Measure velocity (e.g., 8-12x refactors)
Avoid Anti-patterns:
No guidelines (leads to slowdowns)
Blind trust (causes regressions)
Extra Tips for Value Creation:
Chain tools (e.g., Devin =E2=86=92 Cursor)
Benchmark like Zafir
Reality-check like Orosz
Invest in context engineering
Monitor for drift and refine
Reality Check on AI's Role
AI coding tools act as "junior developers" or "compasses"=E2=80=94they acce=
lerate grunt work and provide direction, but require human oversight for qu=
ality, security, and architectural decisions. That=E2=80=99s not changing t=
omorrow. In fact, more advanced tools mean more advanced thinking around sy=
stems design. That=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99ve chosen to highlight durable w=
orkflows here. When ChatGPT-5 comes out (perhaps this week) you may upgrade=
 a tool in the stack here, but you=E2=80=99ll still fundamentally be grappl=
ing with upgrading the same 6 workflows. That won=E2=80=99t change.
My two cents: if you=E2=80=99re just getting started, look for specific sca=
lable use-cases and nail those first. Try something small in even one of th=
ese six workflows and play with it until you start to see it add real value=
=2E Then scale across.=20
Wrapping Up
As we wrap up, remember that the core value of AI isn=E2=80=99t found in th=
e transient hype of any one tool, but in the durable, battle-tested workflo=
ws we=E2=80=99ve explored here. Tools will come and go=E2=80=94what endures=
 are patterns grounded in real experience, validated by those on the front =
lines of innovation. The six workflows I=E2=80=99ve detailed are your compa=
ss in navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered development. =
My hope is that you=E2=80=99ll take these insights and experiment boldly, i=
terate relentlessly, and scale confidently.
More than anything, this guide is an invitation: start small, trust yoursel=
f to learn, and don=E2=80=99t hesitate to pivot as you find your rhythm wit=
h AI. The industry leaders I=E2=80=99ve cited didn=E2=80=99t reach mastery =
overnight=E2=80=94they embraced experimentation, encountered pitfalls, and =
emerged stronger through each iteration. This synthesis of knowledge is mea=
nt to spare you unnecessary setbacks and fast-track your journey from AI-cu=
rious to AI-confident.
Ultimately, the human element is irreplaceable. AI can augment your capabil=
ities, amplify your productivity, and unlock creative avenues previously un=
imaginable=E2=80=94but it=E2=80=99s your intuition, oversight, and strategi=
c thinking that turn potential into reality. I=E2=80=99m excited to see the=
 value you=E2=80=99ll create, the patterns you=E2=80=99ll refine, and the i=
nsights you=E2=80=99ll contribute back to our growing community of builders=
=2E Here=E2=80=99s to writing the next chap=
ter of AI-powered coding together.

 June 2025, Anthropic launched subagents for Claude Code (now part of Claud=
e Projects), enabling multi-agent workflows like opponent processors or par=
allel task agents directly in the interface. This builds on prompt-based se=
tups (e.g., Shipper's and Yang's examples), adding native support for compo=
unding agents with shared context, reducing manual orchestration. Early ado=
pters report improved handling of complex tasks but note increased costs an=
d occasional synchronization bugs in beta.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-an=
