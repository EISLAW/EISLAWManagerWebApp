CANADA’S BID FOR A ‘COUNTRY FIRST’ STRATEGY [3]
RECENT TENSIONS WITH THE U.S. HAVE INSPIRED A RENEWED PRIORITIZATION OF NATIONAL INTERESTS.
BY: ALLISON FEDIRKA
The countries of the G7 held their annual leaders’ summit this week. The gathering, held this year in Alberta, Canada, revived questions over how Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and his
government will handle U.S. ties under the second Trump administration. The two countries have considered each other stalwart allies for decades. Like much of the rest of the world, however, Canada is
reassessing its economic ties and foreign relations in the face of political uncertainty, economic volatility and military conflicts around the globe. This reevaluation revolves primarily around
Ottawa’s ties with Washington, a reflection of their interconnectedness and the Trump administration’s foreign policy maneuvers thus far. Increasingly, Canada is prioritizing its national
interests and adopting a pragmatic and transactional approach to Washington.
RESETTING THE STATUS QUO
Certain basic geopolitical principles apply to every nation in the world. Chief among them is that all countries put national interests above all else and try to reduce constraints on their
decision-making. What varies is how these principles are applied, which is determined by a country’s needs and capabilities. Shifts in the geopolitical climate – of which there have been many of
late – will often provoke changes in behavior. For much of recent history, Canada and the U.S. have fostered a strong bilateral relationship, built on years of cooperation and mutually beneficial
outcomes. The result was an assumption of continued partnership and excessive sense of security.
As the U.S. recalibrates its relationships abroad, however, the status quo in U.S.-Canada ties has shifted. Washington’s level-setting pursuits have left Canada with two choices: go along with
Washington’s demands or push back with countermeasures of its own. It has chosen the latter, which meets two of Canada’s basic needs: improve national connectivity (literally and figuratively) and
reduce, to the degree possible, vulnerabilities with the U.S.
Much of the friction between the two countries revolves around trade matters. Since the start of 2025, U.S. and Canadian officials have been holding formal and informal talks on how to navigate the
issue. Over the past five months, the U.S. has imposed on Canada general and product-specific tariffs up to 25 percent, targeting major drivers of the Canadian economy. The duties have already had an
impact on trade relations. In April, Canada’s goods exports to the U.S. totaled 60.4 billion Canadian dollars ($44.2 billion), a 14.2 percent drop from the previous year and 15.7 percent drop from
the previous month. Canada’s imports from the U.S. for the same period were down 10.8 percent compared to the previous month and 5.9 percent compared to the previous year. (While fluctuating
exchange rates might account for some of this, they can’t account for all of it.)
[US-Canada Tariffs, 2025] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
These restrictions and threats of restrictions will likely continue throughout the year for three main reasons. First, much of U.S.-Canada trade is wrapped up in the USMCA trade agreement, and
disputes can be settled only through upcoming negotiations on revamping the deal. While a scheduled review was slated for 2026, all three parties (the U.S., Canada and Mexico) have expressed
willingness to start talks later this year. The U.S. will likely use tariffs (or the threat of tariffs) as a tactic to skew the negotiations in its favor. Second, the U.S. is conducting reviews of
trade in certain industries that are expected to result in new tariffs. One of these is lumber – of which Canada is a major supplier for the United States. Lastly, the Trump administration has
declared a national trade emergency, giving it the authority to override existing trade agreements. It will likely continue to apply this legal framework going forward.
OTTAWA’S RESPONSE
Canada has crafted a multilayered response that aims to retaliate, build its domestic economy and selectively reduce its strategic vulnerabilities stemming from overexposure to the U.S. market. This
strategy reflects the fact that Ottawa cannot fight the trade war on an equal footing with Washington and has chosen to prioritize its national interests. The Canadian government has used targeted
economic measures as a first response to U.S. tariffs. For example, when the U.S. in early March imposed 25 percent blanket duties on most Canadian goods, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25
percent tax on electricity exports to the United States. Quebec’s provincial leaders said they were also considering blocking future electricity exports. These two provinces together provide
electricity to more than 1.7 million U.S. homes, concentrated in Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont and Maine. The move got the attention of the U.S. government, which refrained from following
through with 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Canada is also considering export controls on critical minerals like germanium and gallium and tariffs on zinc, copper and nickel. Limited measures in financial markets have also been suggested.
Earlier this month, the Ontario Financing Authority issued $2 billion worth of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds in a deal led by Barclays and three Canadian banks. It was the first time in 14 years (and
more than 40 deals) that U.S. banks were left out of a U.S. dollar bond sale by the province.
The trade war has also afforded the government in Ottawa political capital to advance its domestic economic agenda. United by concerns over the impact of tariffs, the federal government and provincial
premiers have agreed on the need to strengthen and solidify the domestic economy. In early March, Ottawa announced that it would remove 20 of the 39 remaining federal exceptions to the Canadian Free
Trade Agreement (which removed barriers to trade between provinces) in an effort to increase interprovincial trade and local business opportunities across the country. Measures were also introduced to
harmonize regulations across provinces, create national standards and facilitate worker mobility. The government estimates that these changes could lower prices by up to 15 percent, increase
productivity by up to 7 percent and grow the economy 4-8 percent.
Premiers from several provinces have expressed support for these efforts. Indeed, cooperation among the provinces and between the federal and provincial governments has grown as a result of the recent
tensions with the U.S. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Carney and the provincial premiers jointly announced the National Trade and Energy Corridor Strategy to diversify the Canadian economy and
reduce its vulnerability to changes in U.S. policy. The strategy calls for fast-tracking strategic projects related to transportation, energy, critical minerals and digital connectivity. The federal
and provincial governments will jointly decide on priority projects, streamline the permitting process and help fund transportation links to resource extraction sites. The goal is to make Canada more
self-reliant, improve national security and support long-term economic growth.

The most promising sector that will help Canada diversify its export market is mining. Canada is one of the largest holders, extractors and processors of critical minerals in the Western world. This
makes it less dependent than many other countries on Chinese supplies and a key alternative to Chinese minerals for other Western markets. The government has therefore announced plans to extend the
mineral exploration tax credit for two additional years and broaden its scope to include critical minerals needed in defense, semiconductors and energy technology. Financiers will get a 15 percent tax
credit for investing in flow-through shares of smaller mining companies and support for raising more capital. The government also plans to increase funding for technical studies related to exploration
and expand a clean manufacturing tax credit to include brownfield site development. There’s also broad support for assisting in development of Ontario’s “ring of fire” deposits. Last, efforts
are underway to expand Manitoba’s Port of Churchill to facilitate the export of critical minerals to global markets.
On the energy front, Canada’s focus is primarily on national self-sufficiency and diversifying its overseas customer base. Projects under consideration include transmitting wind energy from Nova
Scotia to the western regions, a bitumen pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick and a pipeline from the western oil sands to the east located entirely on Canadian territory. Environmentalists will
likely raise objections, but even the liberal government has hinted at prioritizing energy security over environmental concerns, saying that oil projects will have emission caps but no production
caps.
Efforts to diversify the oil sector away from the U.S. will take time. In 2023, Canada exported CA$124 billion worth of oil, accounting for 16 percent of all Canadian exports. The United States made
up 97 percent of these sales – not surprising considering that nearly all of Canada’s oil infrastructure is built to cater to the U.S. market. (All but one of Canada’s oil pipelines pass through
U.S. territory.) But the government hopes the planned pipelines and port expansions will facilitate exports to other overseas markets. Meanwhile, Alberta has signed a cooperation agreement with the
Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security on developing the province’s energy and natural resources. Alberta’s premier is also negotiating the sale of 2 million barrels of oil per month to
an unspecified global oil and petrochemical firm. In the meantime, the 2024 expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline has already resulted in increased oil shipments – 30 tankers total in March –
to Asian markets. China is the biggest buyer, averaging 207,000 barrels per day in the past 12 months. These sales are a small fraction of exports to the U.S., but they will likely grow and are
indicative of Canada’s intentions in the long term.

Canada’s biggest challenge in its quest for self-sufficiency is arguably in the area of defense. For decades, the U.S.-Canada partnership on this front has benefited both countries, particularly
when it comes to secure borders and integrated aerospace defense efforts like NORAD. But Carney has acknowledged the deterioration of international norms and institutions, saying in March that the
country “cannot and should not look first to others to defend our nation.” In addition to modernizing its military capabilities, one of Canada’s main defense objectives is thus to level the
playing field with the U.S.
The Canadian military is most concerned with aerospace defense, naval capabilities, cybersecurity and Arctic development. Of these streams, Canada’s biggest capability gap is in aerospace, where
much of its hardware and system platforms are reliant on the U.S. The military is therefore prioritizing the three other concerns in its efforts to achieve greater independence. Its approach focuses
on developing the domestic defense industry and reaching out to allied military suppliers.
On cybersecurity, Canada’s strategy encourages the involvement of Canadian business and workers. The government has also tapped Canadian firms to help modernize its naval capabilities, awarding a
CA$8 billion contract to Nova Scotia’s Irving Shipbuilding for the construction of new destroyers for the Royal Canadian Navy. But it’s also looking abroad for other needs. Canada is in the market
for new submarines, and Germany, Norway and South Korea have all offered their services. In addition, South Korea is pitching its KF-21 fighter jet as an alternative for fulfilling the remainder of
its U.S.-made F-35 order (Canada has received 16 of the 88 planes ordered). In March, Canada announced it will partner with Australia to build an early warning radar system, which will help secure the
Arctic. It’s well positioned to be a leader in Arctic security and a critical partner for the U.S. in this domain. Last, the Canadian government has entered discussions to join the European
Union’s ReArm Europe plan.
While Canada and the U.S. still have many overlapping interests, the reconfiguration of bilateral ties reminds both governments that their partnership cannot be taken for granted. Each country is
motivated to improve its standing relative to the other in future negotiations and reduce risks resulting from overdependence. For Canada, such moves will help reduce the vulnerabilities created by
partnering so closely with the United States and better position the country to pursue its interests regardless of the dictates of its southern neighbor.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The countries of t=
he G7 held their annual leaders=E2=80=99 summit this week. The gathering, h=
eld this year in Alberta, Canada, revived questions over how Canadian Prime=
 Minister Mark Carney and his government will handle U.S. ties under the se=
cond Trump administration. The two countries have considered each other sta=
lwart allies for decades. Like much of the rest of the world, however, Cana=
da is reassessing its economic ties and foreign relations in the face of po=
litical uncertainty, economic volatility and military conflicts around the =
globe. This reevaluation revolves primarily around Ottawa=E2=80=99s ties wi=
th Washington, a reflection of their interconnectedness and the Trump admin=
istration=E2=80=99s foreign policy maneuvers thus far. Increasingly, Canada=
 is prioritizing its national interests and adopting a pragmatic and transa=
ctional approach to Washington.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Resetting =
the Status Quo</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Certain basic geop=
olitical principles apply to every nation in the world. Chief among them is=
 that all countries put national interests above all else and try to reduce=
 constraints on their decision-making. What varies is how these principles =
are applied, which is determined by a country=E2=80=99s needs and capabilit=
ies. Shifts in the geopolitical climate =E2=80=93 of which there have been =
many of late =E2=80=93 will often provoke changes in behavior. For much of =
recent history, Canada and the U.S. have fostered a strong bilateral relati=
onship, built on years of cooperation and mutually beneficial outcomes. The=
 result was an assumption of continued partnership and excessive sense of s=
ecurity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As the U.S. recali=
brates its relationships abroad, however, the status quo in U.S.-Canada tie=
s has shifted. Washington=E2=80=99s level-setting pursuits have left Canada=
 with two choices: go along with Washington=E2=80=99s demands or push back =
with countermeasures of its own. It has chosen the latter, which meets two =
of Canada=E2=80=99s basic needs: improve national connectivity (literally a=
nd figuratively) and reduce, to the degree possible, vulnerabilities with t=
he U.S.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Much of the fricti=
on between the two countries revolves around trade matters. Since the start=
 of 2025, U.S. and Canadian officials have been holding formal and informal=
 talks on how to navigate the issue. Over the past five months, the U.S. ha=
s imposed on Canada general and product-specific tariffs up to 25 percent, =
targeting major drivers of the Canadian economy. The duties have already ha=
d an impact on trade relations. In April, Canada=E2=80=99s goods exports to=
 the U.S. totaled 60.4 billion Canadian dollars ($44.2 billion), a 14.2 per=
cent drop from the previous year and 15.7 percent drop from the previous mo=
nth. Canada=E2=80=99s imports from the U.S. for the same period were down 1=
0.8 percent compared to the previous month and 5.9 percent compared to the =
previous year. (While fluctuating exchange rates might account for some of =
this, they can=E2=80=99t account for all of it.)</p>

</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These restrictions=
 and threats of restrictions will likely continue throughout the year for t=
hree main reasons. First, much of U.S.-Canada trade is wrapped up in the US=
MCA trade agreement, and disputes can be settled only through upcoming nego=
tiations on revamping the deal. While a scheduled review was slated for 202=
6, all three parties (the U.S., Canada and Mexico) have expressed willingne=
ss to start talks later this year. The U.S. will likely use tariffs (or the=
 threat of tariffs) as a tactic to skew the negotiations in its favor. Seco=
nd, the U.S. is conducting reviews of trade in certain industries that are =
expected to result in new tariffs. One of these is lumber =E2=80=93 of whic=
h Canada is a major supplier for the United States. Lastly, the Trump admin=
istration has declared a national trade emergency, giving it the authority =
to override existing trade agreements. It will likely continue to apply thi=
s legal framework going forward.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Ottawa=E2=
=80=99s Response</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Canada has crafted=
 a multilayered response that aims to retaliate, build its domestic economy=
 and selectively reduce its strategic vulnerabilities stemming from overexp=
osure to the U.S. market. This strategy reflects the fact that Ottawa canno=
t fight the trade war on an equal footing with Washington and has chosen to=
 prioritize its national interests. The Canadian government has used target=
ed economic measures as a first response to U.S. tariffs. For example, when=
 the U.S. in early March imposed 25 percent blanket duties on most Canadian=
 goods, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25 percent tax on electricity=
 exports to the United States. Quebec=E2=80=99s provincial leaders said the=
y were also considering blocking future electricity exports. These two prov=
inces together provide electricity to more than 1.7 million U.S. homes, con=
centrated in Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont and Maine. The move got=
 the attention of the U.S. government, which refrained from following throu=
gh with 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Canada is also con=
sidering export controls on critical minerals like germanium and gallium an=
d tariffs on zinc, copper and nickel. Limited measures in financial markets=
 have also been suggested. Earlier this month, the Ontario Financing Author=
ity issued $2 billion worth of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds in a deal led =
by Barclays and three Canadian banks. It was the first time in 14 years (an=
d more than 40 deals) that U.S. banks were left out of a U.S. dollar bond s=
ale by the province.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The trade war has =
also afforded the government in Ottawa political capital to advance its dom=
estic economic agenda. United by concerns over the impact of tariffs, the f=
ederal government and provincial premiers have agreed on the need to streng=
then and solidify the domestic economy. In early March, Ottawa announced th=
at it would remove 20 of the 39 remaining federal exceptions to the Canadia=
n Free Trade Agreement (which removed barriers to trade between provinces) =
in an effort to increase interprovincial trade and local business opportuni=
ties across the country. Measures were also introduced to harmonize regulat=
ions across provinces, create national standards and facilitate worker mobi=
lity. The government estimates that these changes could lower prices by up =
to 15 percent, increase productivity by up to 7 percent and grow the econom=
y 4-8 percent.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Premiers from seve=
ral provinces have expressed support for these efforts. Indeed, cooperation=
 among the provinces and between the federal and provincial governments has=
 grown as a result of the recent tensions with the U.S. Earlier this year, =
Prime Minister Mark Carney and the provincial premiers jointly announced th=
e National Trade and Energy Corridor Strategy to diversify the Canadian eco=
nomy and reduce its vulnerability to changes in U.S. policy. The strategy c=
alls for fast-tracking strategic projects related to transportation, energy=
, critical minerals and digital connectivity. The federal and provincial go=
vernments will jointly decide on priority projects, streamline the permitti=
ng process and help fund transportation links to resource extraction sites.=
 The goal is to make Canada more self-reliant, improve national security an=
d support long-term economic growth.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The most promising=
 sector that will help Canada diversify its export market is mining. Canada=
 is one of the largest holders, extractors and processors of critical miner=
als in the Western world. This makes it less dependent than many other coun=
tries on Chinese supplies and a key alternative to Chinese minerals for oth=
er Western markets. The government has therefore announced plans to extend =
the mineral exploration tax credit for two additional years and broaden its=
 scope to include critical minerals needed in defense, semiconductors and e=
nergy technology. Financiers will get a 15 percent tax credit for investing=
 in flow-through shares of smaller mining companies and support for raising=
 more capital. The government also plans to increase funding for technical =
studies related to exploration and expand a clean manufacturing tax credit =
to include brownfield site development. There=E2=80=99s also broad support =
for assisting in development of Ontario=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cring of fire=E2=
=80=9D deposits. Last, efforts are underway to expand Manitoba=E2=80=99s Po=
rt of Churchill to facilitate the export of critical minerals to global mar=
kets.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On the energy fron=
t, Canada=E2=80=99s focus is primarily on national self-sufficiency and div=
ersifying its overseas customer base. Projects under consideration include =
transmitting wind energy from Nova Scotia to the western regions, a bitumen=
 pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick and a pipeline from the western oil=
 sands to the east located entirely on Canadian territory. Environmentalist=
s will likely raise objections, but even the liberal government has hinted =
at prioritizing energy security over environmental concerns, saying that oi=
l projects will have emission caps but no production caps.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Efforts to diversi=
fy the oil sector away from the U.S. will take time. In 2023, Canada export=
ed CA$124 billion worth of oil, accounting for 16 percent of all Canadian e=
xports. The United States made up 97 percent of these sales =E2=80=93 not s=
urprising considering that nearly all of Canada=E2=80=99s oil infrastructur=
e is built to cater to the U.S. market. (All but one of Canada=E2=80=99s oi=
l pipelines pass through U.S. territory.) But the government hopes the plan=
ned pipelines and port expansions will facilitate exports to other overseas=
 markets. Meanwhile, Alberta has signed a cooperation agreement with the Ja=
pan Organization for Metals and Energy Security on developing the province=
=E2=80=99s energy and natural resources. Alberta=E2=80=99s premier is also =
negotiating the sale of 2 million barrels of oil per month to an unspecifie=
d global oil and petrochemical firm. In the meantime, the 2024 expansion of=
 the Trans Mountain pipeline has already resulted in increased oil shipment=
s =E2=80=93 30 tankers total in March =E2=80=93 to Asian markets. China is =
the biggest buyer, averaging 207,000 barrels per day in the past 12 months.=
 These sales are a small fraction of exports to the U.S., but they will lik=
ely grow and are indicative of Canada=E2=80=99s intentions in the long term=
.</p>

rrier</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Canada=E2=80=99s b=
iggest challenge in its quest for self-sufficiency is arguably in the area =
of defense. For decades, the U.S.-Canada partnership on this front has bene=
fited both countries, particularly when it comes to secure borders and inte=
grated aerospace defense efforts like NORAD. But Carney has acknowledged th=
e deterioration of international norms and institutions, saying in March th=
at the country =E2=80=9Ccannot and should not look first to others to defen=
d our nation.=E2=80=9D In addition to modernizing its military capabilities=
, one of Canada=E2=80=99s main defense objectives is thus to level the play=
ing field with the U.S.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Canadian milit=
ary is most concerned with aerospace defense, naval capabilities, cybersecu=
rity and Arctic development. Of these streams, Canada=E2=80=99s biggest cap=
ability gap is in aerospace, where much of its hardware and system platform=
s are reliant on the U.S. The military is therefore prioritizing the three =
other concerns in its efforts to achieve greater independence. Its approach=
 focuses on developing the domestic defense industry and reaching out to al=
lied military suppliers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On cybersecurity, =
Canada=E2=80=99s strategy encourages the involvement of Canadian business a=
nd workers. The government has also tapped Canadian firms to help modernize=
 its naval capabilities, awarding a CA$8 billion contract to Nova Scotia=E2=
=80=99s Irving Shipbuilding for the construction of new destroyers for the =
Royal Canadian Navy. But it=E2=80=99s also looking abroad for other needs. =
Canada is in the market for new submarines, and Germany, Norway and South K=
orea have all offered their services. In addition, South Korea is pitching =
its KF-21 fighter jet as an alternative for fulfilling the remainder of its=
 U.S.-made F-35 order (Canada has received 16 of the 88 planes ordered). In=
 March, Canada announced it will partner with Australia to build an early w=
arning radar system, which will help secure the Arctic. It=E2=80=99s well p=
ositioned to be a leader in Arctic security and a critical partner for the =
U.S. in this domain. Last, the Canadian government has entered discussions =
to join the European Union=E2=80=99s ReArm Europe plan.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While Canada and t=
he U.S. still have many overlapping interests, the reconfiguration of bilat=
eral ties reminds both governments that their partnership cannot be taken f=
or granted. Each country is motivated to improve its standing relative to t=
he other in future negotiations and reduce risks resulting from overdepende=
nce. For Canada, such moves will help reduce the vulnerabilities created by=
 partnering so closely with the United States and better position the count=
ry to pursue its interests regardless of the dictates of its southern neigh=
bor.</p>
