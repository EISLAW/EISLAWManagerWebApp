HOW CYBER ESCALATION IS CHANGING CONFLICT [3]
ESCALATION TODAY IS MEASURED LESS BY THE WEAPONS EMPLOYED THAN BY THE SYSTEMS DISABLED.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
On Sept. 19-20, coordinated cyberattacks disabled airport check-in systems across Europe, stranding passengers and forcing airports onto manual backups. It was the most visible case in a rising tempo
of disruptions targeting European infrastructure last month.
Cyber operations are often considered to occupy a “lower rung” on the so-called escalation ladder, but this is an oversimplification. Escalation is defined not by the method of attack but by how
much the attack alters or degrades an adversary’s capacity to act. The events in Europe over the past month highlight that escalation can arrive digitally, producing paralysis and pressure without a
shot being fired.
Modern societies operate on fragile systems of communication and navigation. When those networks are disabled, society grinds to a halt, in the same way that a modern military force deprived of ISR
(intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), GPS navigation, communications and targeting sensors loses the ability to see, coordinate and strike effectively. Nowhere is this vulnerability clearer
than in the United States – physically secure behind oceans and layered defenses, yet critically dependent on digital infrastructure that is globally connected and therefore globally exposed. A
strike on this information backbone can have the same operational effect as destroying a physical installation – and indeed can destroy infrastructure in certain cases – often at far lower cost
and with greater deniability.
This reframing matters because it alters how to measure risk and intent. A missile strike on a radar site and malware that blinds the same radar produce equivalent outcomes: loss of coverage, degraded
tempo and hesitation at the command level. For societies already weary of conflict, repeated digital disruptions to energy and water may be enough to pressure leaders into restraint. Cyber is
therefore not merely harassment; it is a parallel form of coercion that contests the very advantages modern militaries rely on to fight. Cyber escalation collapses distance and erases the line between
front and rear, degrading militaries at the point of attack while pulling civilians oceans away into a digitally contested front line.
STRATEGIC CONTEXT
For some nations, geography acts as a defensive multiplier – for the U.S. most of all, shielded by oceans and able to project power outward. But America’s reach depends on a nervous system that is
digital, commercial and porous, including ISR constellations, GPS networks, satellite communications, financial rails and civilian infrastructure all bound together in ways adversaries can probe. This
integration widens access points and lowers the cost of inflicting disruption, making the cyber domain uniquely attractive in the present international environment. Geography still matters, but cyber
rewrites it, making nations a target that distance once rendered unreachable.
Other nations have already demonstrated how cyber disruption can be linked with strategic aims. Russia has paired cyber disruptions with conventional operations in Georgia and Ukraine, undermining
command systems and delaying responses. China has reportedly conducted extensive cyber espionage, supply chain probing and prepositioning in U.S. and allied networks, probing resilience and response
thresholds without crossing red lines. Iran and North Korea have used cyber operations to coerce adversaries and – especially in North Korea’s case – generate revenue under sanctions; targets
have included banks, energy networks and defense industry supply chains. In these cases, the operational goal was not destruction but paralysis – buying time, blunting tempo and undermining the
adversary’s confidence in the security of rear areas.
In societies already strained by war weariness, cyber disruptions to daily life (e.g., airport check-in failures, fuel shortages, blackouts and targeted interference in elections) generate visible
costs without the images of civilian casualties that trigger wider escalation. For adversaries seeking to contest the reach of advanced democracies, it is easier to attack confidence in their systems
than to strike their forces directly.
USES AND CONSTRAINTS
Cyber escalation has a number of advantages. First, modern combat runs on continuous sensor coverage, so when feeds are cut or corrupted, advanced platforms lose their edge. Degradation can come from
external deception (jamming or spoofing) or from internal compromise (malware or data manipulation). The former is electronic, the latter cyber – but they produce the same operational effect.
Second, it can slow logistics and disrupt tempo. Tampering with airport check-in, manifests or fuel flows can in some cases delay mobilization as effectively as striking a depot. Such intrusions
rarely end with a brief outage; they expose network topology, credentials and procedures for follow-on use.
Third, it is low-cost and can be plausibly denied. Remote, scalable tools enable smaller states – and larger ones seeking to avoid open confrontation – to impose costs without directly being
blamed. Finally, it can probe thresholds short of kinetic war, testing an adversary’s resolve and shaping the battlespace without crossing red lines.
But these advantages can also backfire. Attribution uncertainty shields attackers but also blunts coercion: Pressure is hard to apply when responsibility is unclear. Dual-use networks create blowback
risk: A targeted logistics hit can spill into civilian services and trigger political backlash. Effects are uneven: malware misfires, defenders reroute and redundancy absorbs damage. And if disruption
is severe – crippling power, disabling or degrading satellites and space-based services, or manipulating dam controls – the victim may answer as if to a physical attack, escalating across domains.
Cyber also erodes the informational base of high-order deterrence. Early warning, ISR, precision targeting and secure command links are the scaffolding of nuclear and long-range strike credibility. If
they are degraded, states drift toward pre-delegation or launch-on-warning, increasing the risk of catastrophic or even nuclear war. Cyber thus alters conventional tempo and the stability of
deterrence alike, demanding doctrine, resilience and diplomacy to prevent miscalculation.
CASE STUDIES
Cyber escalation has already shown its ability to overcome distance and move the battlefield inside national infrastructure. In 2007, Estonia became the first state-scale example when distributed
denial-of-service attacks overwhelmed ministries, banks and media outlets. Though no bombs fell, the effect was significant disruption to online services and daily functions.
The following year, Russia’s invasion of Georgia marked the prototype for pairing cyber activity with conventional force. Government websites and communications were disrupted during fighting,
creating confusion and slowing Georgia’s ability to mobilize and coordinate its response. Though limited in scale, it offered an early preview of how digital operations could be synchronized with
military campaigns to amplify pressure in the opening phase.
In 2010, the Stuxnet malware used against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility revealed another dimension: precision sabotage. By degrading centrifuges through digital means, it delayed a strategic
program without missiles or airstrikes, yet still succeeded in physically destroying critical equipment inside one of Iran’s most protected facilities. Responsibility was never officially claimed,
though the attack was widely attributed to U.S. and Israeli actors. Crucially, plausible deniability left Iran without a clear state to retaliate against – something that would have been unavoidable
after a missile strike.
From 2014 onward, Ukraine experienced cyber escalation on a broader scale. Russia paired incursions with digital operations against ministries, media and power grids, cutting electricity to hundreds
of thousands. In 2022, Russia’s invasion opened with the same logic on a larger scale. Satellite communications were disrupted, GPS signals jammed and decision-making tempo slowed in ways that
paralleled traditional preparatory fires.
In July 2025, Aeroflot, Russia’s national airline, was hit by a cyberattack that forced cancellation of more than 100 flights. Two pro-Ukraine groups claimed responsibility, asserting long-term
access to systems, disruption of 7,000 servers and exposure of internal data. The incident reflects the logic of cyber escalation: Coercive digital strikes are reciprocal, and no state can assume
immunity.
Taken together, these cases trace an evolution: from political harassment (Estonia), to prototype integration (Georgia), to precision sabotage with deniability (Stuxnet), and finally to fully
integrated battlefield shaping (Ukraine).
CONCLUSION
The trajectory of escalation points toward cyber operations as the opening moves not only in great-power conflict but across the spectrum of state competition. Geography no longer guarantees a buffer;
attacks arrive inside networks at once. For attackers, the incentives are clear: blind ISR, disrupt logistics and sever communications to deny the defender initiative at minimal cost. Inexpensive,
scalable tools let smaller states reach the infrastructure of major powers. Limited disruptions to civilian systems can yield outsized political effects. For defenders, the test is continuity under
degraded information; can forces fight when visibility, timing and coordination are uncertain?
Cyber will not replace conventional force, but it will precondition it. Its utility, however, is constrained by the fact that, unlike armies, cyber operations are not always tightly regulated by
states, sometimes relying instead on proxies or actors beyond strict control. Opening digital strikes will set the tempo and shape choices before the first shots, though repeated exposure to both
state and non-state attacks steadily hardens defenses, erodes surprise and raises the cost of each attempt. Advantage will fall to states that can absorb disruption and keep operating. Those that rely
on distance or deterrence alone will find their rear areas contested from the start.
Escalation today is measured less by the weapons employed than by the systems disabled. Cyber operations reveal that power can be contested without crossing borders or firing a shot, by striking at
the nervous system that gives modern militaries their reach. The challenge for nations is not simply to defend networks but to adapt strategy to a reality where the first strike can arrive everywhere
at once, and where endurance will hinge on resilience more than distance. Although limited, the Sept. 19-20 attack on Europe’s airport check-in systems underscored this reality once again.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On Sept. 19-20, coordinated cyberattacks disabled airport check-in systems across Europe, stranding passengers and forcing airports onto manual backups. It was the most visible case in a rising tempo of disruptions targeting European infrastructure last month.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cyber operations are often considered to occupy a “lower rung” on the so-called escalation ladder, but this is an oversimplification. Escalation is defined not by the method of attack but by how much the attack alters or degrades an adversary’s capacity to act. The events in Europe over the past month highlight that escalation can arrive digitally, producing paralysis and pressure without a shot being fired.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Modern societies operate on fragile systems of communication and navigation. When those networks are disabled, society grinds to a halt, in the same way that a modern military force deprived of ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), GPS navigation, communications and targeting sensors loses the ability to see, coordinate and strike effectively. Nowhere is this vulnerability clearer than in the United States – physically secure behind oceans and layered defenses, yet critically dependent on digital infrastructure that is globally connected and therefore globally exposed. A strike on this information backbone can have the same operational effect as destroying a physical installation – and indeed can destroy infrastructure in certain cases – often at far lower cost and with greater deniability.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This reframing matters because it alters how to measure risk and intent. A missile strike on a radar site and malware that blinds the same radar produce equivalent outcomes: loss of coverage, degraded tempo and hesitation at the command level. For societies already weary of conflict, repeated digital disruptions to energy and water may be enough to pressure leaders into restraint. Cyber is therefore not merely harassment; it is a parallel form of coercion that contests the very advantages modern militaries rely on to fight. Cyber escalation collapses distance and erases the line between front and rear, degrading militaries at the point of attack while pulling civilians oceans away into a digitally contested front line.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Strategic Context</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For some nations, geography acts as a defensive multiplier – for the U.S. most of all, shielded by oceans and able to project power outward. But America’s reach depends on a nervous system that is digital, commercial and porous, including ISR constellations, GPS networks, satellite communications, financial rails and civilian infrastructure all bound together in ways adversaries can probe. This integration widens access points and lowers the cost of inflicting disruption, making the cyber domain uniquely attractive in the present international environment. Geography still matters, but cyber rewrites it, making nations a target that distance once rendered unreachable.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Other nations have already demonstrated how cyber disruption can be linked with strategic aims. Russia has paired cyber disruptions with conventional operations in Georgia and Ukraine, undermining command systems and delaying responses. China has reportedly conducted extensive cyber espionage, supply chain probing and prepositioning in U.S. and allied networks, probing resilience and response thresholds without crossing red lines. Iran and North Korea have used cyber operations to coerce adversaries and – especially in North Korea’s case – generate revenue under sanctions; targets have included banks, energy networks and defense industry supply chains. In these cases, the operational goal was not destruction but paralysis – buying time, blunting tempo and undermining the adversary’s confidence in the security of rear areas.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In societies already strained by war weariness, cyber disruptions to daily life (e.g., airport check-in failures, fuel shortages, blackouts and targeted interference in elections) generate visible costs without the images of civilian casualties that trigger wider escalation. For adversaries seeking to contest the reach of advanced democracies, it is easier to attack confidence in their systems than to strike their forces directly.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Uses and Constraints</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cyber escalation has a number of advantages. First, modern combat runs on continuous sensor coverage, so when feeds are cut or corrupted, advanced platforms lose their edge. Degradation can come from external deception (jamming or spoofing) or from internal compromise (malware or data manipulation). The former is electronic, the latter cyber – but they produce the same operational effect.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Second, it can slow logistics and disrupt tempo. Tampering with airport check-in, manifests or fuel flows can in some cases delay mobilization as effectively as striking a depot. Such intrusions rarely end with a brief outage; they expose network topology, credentials and procedures for follow-on use.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Third, it is low-cost and can be plausibly denied. Remote, scalable tools enable smaller states – and larger ones seeking to avoid open confrontation – to impose costs without directly being blamed. Finally, it can probe thresholds short of kinetic war, testing an adversary’s resolve and shaping the battlespace without crossing red lines.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But these advantages can also backfire. Attribution uncertainty shields attackers but also blunts coercion: Pressure is hard to apply when responsibility is unclear. Dual-use networks create blowback risk: A targeted logistics hit can spill into civilian services and trigger political backlash. Effects are uneven: malware misfires, defenders reroute and redundancy absorbs damage. And if disruption is severe – crippling power, disabling or degrading satellites and space-based services, or manipulating dam controls – the victim may answer as if to a physical attack, escalating across domains.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cyber also erodes the informational base of high-order deterrence. Early warning, ISR, precision targeting and secure command links are the scaffolding of nuclear and long-range strike credibility. If they are degraded, states drift toward pre-delegation or launch-on-warning, increasing the risk of catastrophic or even nuclear war. Cyber thus alters conventional tempo and the stability of deterrence alike, demanding doctrine, resilience and diplomacy to prevent miscalculation.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cyber escalation has already shown its ability to overcome distance and move the battlefield inside national infrastructure. In 2007, Estonia became the first state-scale example when distributed denial-of-service attacks overwhelmed ministries, banks and media outlets. Though no bombs fell, the effect was significant disruption to online services and daily functions.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The following year, Russia’s invasion of Georgia marked the prototype for pairing cyber activity with conventional force. Government websites and communications were disrupted during fighting, creating confusion and slowing Georgia’s ability to mobilize and coordinate its response. Though limited in scale, it offered an early preview of how digital operations could be synchronized with military campaigns to amplify pressure in the opening phase.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 2010, the Stuxnet malware used against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility revealed another dimension: precision sabotage. By degrading centrifuges through digital means, it delayed a strategic program without missiles or airstrikes, yet still succeeded in physically destroying critical equipment inside one of Iran’s most protected facilities. Responsibility was never officially claimed, though the attack was widely attributed to U.S. and Israeli actors. Crucially, plausible deniability left Iran without a clear state to retaliate against – something that would have been unavoidable after a missile strike.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">From 2014 onward, Ukraine experienced cyber escalation on a broader scale. Russia paired incursions with digital operations against ministries, media and power grids, cutting electricity to hundreds of thousands. In 2022, Russia’s invasion opened with the same logic on a larger scale. Satellite communications were disrupted, GPS signals jammed and decision-making tempo slowed in ways that paralleled traditional preparatory fires.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In July 2025, Aeroflot, Russia’s national airline, was hit by a cyberattack that forced cancellation of more than 100 flights. Two pro-Ukraine groups claimed responsibility, asserting long-term access to systems, disruption of 7,000 servers and exposure of internal data. The incident reflects the logic of cyber escalation: Coercive digital strikes are reciprocal, and no state can assume immunity.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Taken together, these cases trace an evolution: from political harassment (Estonia), to prototype integration (Georgia), to precision sabotage with deniability (Stuxnet), and finally to fully integrated battlefield shaping (Ukraine).</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The trajectory of escalation points toward cyber operations as the opening moves not only in great-power conflict but across the spectrum of state competition. Geography no longer guarantees a buffer; attacks arrive inside networks at once. For attackers, the incentives are clear: blind ISR, disrupt logistics and sever communications to deny the defender initiative at minimal cost. Inexpensive, scalable tools let smaller states reach the infrastructure of major powers. Limited disruptions to civilian systems can yield outsized political effects. For defenders, the test is continuity under degraded information; can forces fight when visibility, timing and coordination are uncertain?</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Cyber will not replace conventional force, but it will precondition it. Its utility, however, is constrained by the fact that, unlike armies, cyber operations are not always tightly regulated by states, sometimes relying instead on proxies or actors beyond strict control. Opening digital strikes will set the tempo and shape choices before the first shots, though repeated exposure to both state and non-state attacks steadily hardens defenses, erodes surprise and raises the cost of each attempt. Advantage will fall to states that can absorb disruption and keep operating. Those that rely on distance or deterrence alone will find their rear areas contested from the start.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Escalation today is measured less by the weapons employed than by the systems disabled. Cyber operations reveal that power can be contested without crossing borders or firing a shot, by striking at the nervous system that gives modern militaries their reach. The challenge for nations is not simply to defend networks but to adapt strategy to a reality where the first strike can arrive everywhere at once, and where endurance will hinge on resilience more than distance. Although limited, the Sept. 19-20 attack on Europe’s airport check-in systems underscored this reality once again.</p>
