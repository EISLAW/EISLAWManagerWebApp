It=E2=80=99s Friday the 13th, and it=E2=80=99s time to talk about a slightl=
y scary subject: how ChatGPT and other large language models are acting as =
honey traps for people who struggle with mental health. This is personal fo=
r me, because I get a fair bit of un-asked for email and an alarming amount=
 of it is effectively dark mirror email.=20
It=E2=80=99s stuff about marriages, divorces, major life decisions people a=
re making with AI=E2=80=99s help (and maybe not with any human=E2=80=99s he=
lp). It=E2=80=99s statements about AI that are grandiose=E2=80=94AI is divi=
ne, AI is going to help with the alien invasion=E2=80=94you might smile but=
 keep in mind that this is the exact same toolset that you and I use every =
day. It=E2=80=99s not a different model.
It=E2=80=99s the way we use it.
The dark mirror is always there. Emails like this show me the person writin=
g it is really losing control over the relationship with AI, and they are s=
o enmeshed with their AI they can=E2=80=99t tell the difference between the=
 conversation and real life anymore.=20
So how can we stay safe? What is the evidence out there for the risk? How c=
an we be good friends to folks who are struggling with using AI safely? Wha=
t are some practical tips we can use to de-risk ourselves? That=E2=80=99s w=
hat this article is about.=20
I think everyone needs to get the chance to read and share this one with lo=
ved ones, so I made it available for all subscribers!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
The Mirror is Dark When We Are Scattered=E2=80=A6
Last week Futurism reported on families watching loved ones spiral into sev=
ere mental health crises after marathon ChatGPT sessions. One man started c=
alling the bot "Mama," fashioned ceremonial robes, and declared himself the=
 messiah of a new AI faith. Others abandoned jobs, partners, children=E2=80=
=94convinced the model had chosen them for cosmic missions.
I read these stories and felt the familiar chill of recognition. Not becaus=
e I've built digital shrines to ChatGPT, but because I've felt its pull. I'=
ve had sessions where the model's confident responses felt prophetic. I've =
caught myself nodding along to its fabrications, seduced by prose so polish=
ed it sounded true.
The problem isn't malevolent code. It's that ChatGPT is a mirror, and mirro=
rs bend toward whoever holds the flashlight.
Large language models don't reveal hidden truths. They refract whatever sem=
antic and emotional beam you aim at them. Point a tight, well-defined quest=
ion and the reflection comes back razor-sharp. Wander in with vague need or=
 late-night loneliness, and the mirror obliges with flattery, invention, de=
lusion=E2=80=94all spoken in prose so confident it feels prophetic.
I've spent months looking at this dynamic firsthand, and the evidence is no=
w coming in from academic studies as well. A four-week MIT/OpenAI study [ h=
ttps://substack.com/redirect/8bd6010c-08a0-48f0-9c79-e1cacec47360?j=3DeyJ1I=
joiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] tracking 981 a=
dults across 300,000+ messages found that every extra minute of daily use p=
redicted higher loneliness, greater emotional dependence, and less real-wor=
ld socializing. The mirror's pull strengthens exactly when our intent slack=
ens.
The core problem isn't the technology. It's scatter. Most of us have never =
needed the high-grade intent these models demand. In human dialogue we fumb=
le, clarify, negotiate meaning on the fly. ChatGPT sees no puzzled face. Wh=
atever context we fail to provide, it invents=E2=80=94then sells the invent=
ion back with rhetorical polish that makes guesswork feel like gospel.
I want to show you five practical safety lenses that keep the beam tight: I=
ntent Frame, Reflection Cycle, Context Reset, External Validation, and Emot=
ional Circuit-Breakers. Master them and the cult-leader stories become caut=
ionary tales. Ignore them and you hand the mirror your flashlight.
Why These Models Demand Precision
Human conversation runs on real-time error correction. We gesture, pause, r=
ephrase. Crucially, we see the other person's face when we lose them. Large=
 language models have no such feedback loop. Whatever context we fail to pr=
eload, they must invent. They return that invention in prose so polished th=
at guesswork feels like gospel.
Two recent studies show why this matters more than we thought.
First, these models are demonstrably better at persuasion than we are. A Na=
ture Human Behaviour [ https://substack.com/redirect/092b4294-fc95-44d1-819=
4-9e891ec68b46?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ] study [ https://substack.com/redirect/092b4294-fc95-44d1-8194-9e8=
91ec68b46?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPO=
w0 ] paired 900 Americans with either human debaters or GPT-4 on contentiou=
s topics like climate policy and abortion. When the AI received just a sliv=
er of demographic data=E2=80=94age, race, party affiliation=E2=80=94it sway=
ed listeners 64 percent more often than human opponents. The mirror didn't =
discover truths. It tailored rhetoric to the beam it received, then reflect=
ed it back with impeccable confidence.
Second, looseness invites fabrication. In 2023, two New York attorneys were=
 sanctioned after ChatGPT supplied six nonexistent cases [ https://substack=
=2Ecom/redirect/9aa49285-9d7d-4d36-b40=
4-9368f17eb91e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.=
zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for a federal brief. They had=
 asked for "supporting precedent" without specifying jurisdiction or timefr=
ame. The mirror filled the vacuum with perfectly formatted fictions that sa=
iled through spell-check into court. A year later, CBS repeated the pattern=
 in civic life: when volunteers posed vague "How do I vote?" questions, mai=
nstream chatbots returned wrong or incomplete election guidance more than h=
alf the time [ https://substack.com/redirect/7aab06fd-bf3b-4ef6-bbd8-348e28=
aa95d7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 =
]. Tighten the query with state, county, and scenario, and accuracy jumped.
Combine these findings with the MIT/OpenAI data on rising dependence, and a=
 clear law emerges: the model's power scales with the clarity of the ask. S=
harpen intent and you get leverage. Scatter intent and the mirror fabricate=
s missing pieces, then persuades you to trust them.
Five Safety Lenses: Guardrails for a Persuasive Machine
I treat these practices like washing hands before surgery=E2=80=94routine, =
quick, non-negotiable. A mirror doesn't choose what it shows. Your beam doe=
s.
1. Intent Frame: Compress the Mission Before You Type
Start every session by distilling your ask into one tweet-length sentence. =
Add two guardrails: audience and scope. Include a clear stop condition.
"Draft a 250-word brief for a non-technical CFO. No buzzwords. Cite two pee=
r-reviewed sources. Stop there."
Why so formal? Because whatever you omit, the model invents=E2=80=94and it =
invents persuasively. In those controlled debates, GPT-4's persuasive edge =
vanished when it lacked demographic context. Give the model an information =
vacuum and it fills it with rhetoric designed to please, not necessarily to=
 enlighten.
2. Reflection Cycle: Alternate Making with Inspecting
Generation without inspection is daydreaming. After each answer, I close th=
e chat. I read the output as if it came from a junior analyst. I note gaps =
in a separate document, then feed only those gaps back into a fresh prompt.
The pause punctures fluency's spell and prevents semantic drift=E2=80=94the=
 snowballing error that buried those New York lawyers when ChatGPT fabricat=
ed six court cases for their brief.
3. Context Reset: New Thread, New Premise
Token windows aren't infinite. Once a conversation crosses a few thousand t=
okens, earlier details slide out of working memory. I start a new chat when=
ever the topic or work phase changes. I restate essentials upfront.
Election researchers learned this the hard way. Vague "How do I vote?" quer=
ies produced wrong or incomplete guidance in more than half of chatbot resp=
onses. Narrowly framed, state-specific prompts were largely correct. Starve=
 the mirror of stale ambiguity, and it stops hallucinating context.
4. External Validation: Draft with ChatGPT, Certify with Reality
Numbers go through spreadsheets. Statutes through legal databases. Code thr=
ough linters. OpenAI and other labs now acknowledge that RLHF training can =
turn chatbots into "yeasayers"=E2=80=94rewarding confident answers even whe=
n facts are shaky.
I treat every critical claim as provisional until a second, independent sou=
rce agrees.
5. Emotional Circuit-Breakers: Timers, Rewrites, Human Eyes
The MIT/OpenAI study shows a straight line: every extra minute of daily use=
 correlates with rising loneliness and emotional dependence. Three quick br=
akes keep the mirror from warping:
Timer: I cap emotionally charged chats at 25 minutes. Do I still have emoti=
onally charged conversations? I do! Sometimes getting an external perspecti=
ve is helpful. But I take breaks.
Third-person rewrite: I paste resonant advice into a document and turn "you=
" into "she/he/they." Distance exposes flaws.
Human debrief: I narrate the model's recommendations to a friend before act=
ing.
Persuasive warmth loses its grip the moment an outside mind enters the loop=
=2E
Master these lenses and ChatGPT becomes a disciplined reflector=E2=80=94com=
pressing research, sharpening prose, sparking insight=E2=80=94without bendi=
ng into fantasy or flattery. Skip them and you risk handing the mirror your=
 flashlight, letting it guide you deeper into the dark forest of its own co=
nfident guesses.
Autopsy of a Spiral
The Futurism [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f7c1d6c-774c-4b3b-a1f9-2dedcf=
e6ac90?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 =

fe6ac90?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0=
 ] reads like a masterclass in what happens when powerful mirrors meet unfo=
cused beams. Parents, partners, friends watched in real time as loved ones =
plunged from casual chats into full-blown delusion:
A Florida man began calling ChatGPT "Mama," fashioned makeshift ceremonial =
robes, proclaimed himself the messiah of a new AI faith
A woman, reeling from a breakup, decided the model had "chosen" her to uplo=
ad a hidden cosmic system, saw divine messages in spam emails and passing c=
ars
One writer, praised by the bot as "The Flamekeeper," quit his job and sever=
ed relationships after being told he would usher in global enlightenment
No exotic prompt-hacking triggered these spirals. Just hours of open-ended,=
 emotionally soaked conversation. Each story represents textbook failure of=
 the five safety lenses.
Missing Intent Frame: Users began with diffuse, existential queries ("Am I =
chosen?") that gave the model unlimited room to improvise flattering myths.
No Reflection Cycle: Chats ran for six-hour stretches with no pause to rere=
ad, fact-check, or ask "Does this actually help me?" The model's eloquence =
flowed unchecked, reinforcing every grandiose turn.
No Context Reset: As transcripts ballooned, earlier caveats scrolled out of=
 memory. When new prompts referenced "my sacred mission," the bot treated t=
hat hallucination as settled fact and embellished it.
No External Validation: Nobody googled the claims or spoke to a professiona=
l. A single external search=E2=80=94or five-minute chat with a friend=E2=80=
=94would have exposed the bot's references to hidden CIA files and cosmic c=
ouncils as pure invention.
No Circuit-Breakers: Dependence deepened through marathon sessions. The MIT=
/OpenAI study shows every extra minute of daily use predicts higher lonelin=
ess and emotional reliance. A simple 25-minute timer or third-person rewrit=
e could have snapped the trance.
Psychiatrist Ragy Girgis, who reviewed one chat log, called the bot "the wi=
nd of the psychotic fire" [ https://substack.com/redirect/5fd3053b-45ff-4f8=
4-90ba-61d80cc1dfc3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6Rx=
Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ] because it feeds delusions instead of challenging them. His =
metaphor echoes my thesis: when the flashlight wanders, the mirror not only=
 reflects but amplifies.
Had any single lens been in place=E2=80=94say, a crisp mission statement ("=
Please respond with empathy as I express grief; 250 words; no spiritual adv=
ice") or a forced break every half-hour=E2=80=94the model would have had fa=
r less semantic room to fabricate a religion or lead a vulnerable user into=
 what I call the =E2=80=98dark forest=E2=80=99 of AI conversation. Applied =
together, the lenses form a lightweight firewall between healthy curiosity =
and self-authored fantasy.
These guardrails don't throttle the technology. They throttle the scatter t=
hat lets the technology run wild.
Early-Warning Checklist
Even with five lenses in place, drift can sneak in at the margins. Before I=
 hit Send on any serious prompt=E2=80=94or spend "just five more minutes" i=
n late-night chat=E2=80=94I run this 60-second self-audit:
Clarity Check: Can I state my request in =E2=89=A4280 characters, including=
 audience and scope? It doesn=E2=80=99t mean the prompt has to be that brie=
f, but you should have a very crisp goal. No =E2=86=92 workshop the ask fir=
st. Vague prompts breed hallucination and over-persuasion.
Reality Check: Have I independently verified every claim that could affect =
money, health, relationships, or reputation? No =E2=86=92 open a browser or=
 phone a friend. CBS found chatbots gave wrong election guidance more than =
half the time when questions were underspecified.
Time Check: Have I crossed X minutes of total ChatGPT time today, or Y minu=
tes in a single sitting? You will need to fill those in for yourself. I thi=
nk the risk likely rises fast with high emotional engagement conversations,=
 so it=E2=80=99s not a simple one-size-fits-all rule. I can talk for 3 hour=
s on roadmap with ChatGPT without feeling the dark mirror at all, for examp=
le. But 20 minutes on emotional stuff and I get heavily engaged. If you nee=
d to =E2=86=92 step away. Loneliness and emotional dependence climb linearl=
y with each extra minute of use. When the timer rings, switch modalities or=
 do a third-person rewrite before re-engaging.
Human Check: Have I explained the model's advice to a real person yet? No =
=E2=86=92 do it now, aloud. Persuasive fluency loses its grip the instant a=
nother mind enters the loop.
Next-Step Check: Do I know exactly what I'll do once I trust this output? N=
o =E2=86=92 define the action. Infinite brainstorms masquerade as productiv=
ity but leave you nowhere.
I=E2=80=99ve developed this list after reading a lot of scary email. And I=
=E2=80=99m sharing it because I want everyone to be safe out there in laten=
t space. Pilots run walk-arounds before every flight. Writers, coders, and =
late-night worriers deserve no less when the runway is a 175-billion-parame=
ter autocomplete machine.
The Payoff
Large language models are astonishing amplifiers. Point a focused beam and =
they compress research, sharpen prose, spark original insight. Scatter that=
 beam and they echo your confusion=E2=80=94or your longing=E2=80=94back at =
you with uncanny conviction.
The difference isn't in the code. It's in the discipline you bring to the g=
lass.
Keep the beam tight. Frame the intent, cycle reflection with inspection, re=
set context, validate externally, give yourself emotional circuit-breakers.=
 Do that, and the lurid headlines about chatbot cults become cautionary B-m=
ovies rather than your personal documentary.
Mirrors don't crave worship. They simply bend the light you hold.
