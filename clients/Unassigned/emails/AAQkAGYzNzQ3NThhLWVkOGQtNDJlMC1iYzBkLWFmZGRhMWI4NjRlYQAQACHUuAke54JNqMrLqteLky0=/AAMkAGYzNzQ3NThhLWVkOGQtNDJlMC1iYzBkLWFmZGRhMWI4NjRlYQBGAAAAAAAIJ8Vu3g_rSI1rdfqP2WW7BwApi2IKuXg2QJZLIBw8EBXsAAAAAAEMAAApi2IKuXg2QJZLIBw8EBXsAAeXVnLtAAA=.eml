Anthropic just released Skills for Claude, and everyone=E2=80=99s missing w=
hat this actually is.
Skills aren=E2=80=99t a Claude feature. They=E2=80=99re the answer to the q=
uestion I get asked most: =E2=80=9CHow do I stop rewriting the same massive=
 prompts every single time?=E2=80=9D
You know the drill. You want to create a financial presentation. Or evaluat=
e an AI vendor. Or build a comprehensive job search strategy. And you sit d=
own to write the prompt, and suddenly you=E2=80=99re explaining everything:
How you want the analysis structured
What frameworks matter to you
Your preferences for formatting and style
The domain context the AI needs
Oh yeah, and what you actually want this time
You end up with a 500-word prompt just to get started. And next week when y=
ou need something similar? You=E2=80=99re doing it again. Copy-pasting from=
 old prompts, modifying them, hoping you didn=E2=80=99t forget something im=
portant.
It=E2=80=99s exhausting. And it=E2=80=99s why most people never get past ba=
sic Q&A with AI=E2=80=94complex work requires too much setup.
Skills change this completely. They let you package up all that methodology=
 once. Your frameworks. Your preferences. Your domain expertise. The stuff =
you=E2=80=99ve learned over years that=E2=80=99s way too nuanced to cram in=
to a prompt. All of it goes into a skill, and then your actual prompt is ju=
st about what you want: =E2=80=9CCreate a Q3 financial presentation focused=
 on customer retention, using this data.=E2=80=9D=20
The skill handles everything else.
But here=E2=80=99s the part nobody=E2=80=99s talking about: these work ever=
ywhere. Not just Claude. Yes, you can use the exact same skill files in Cha=
tGPT. In Gemini. Anywhere that reads files. Claude=E2=80=99s automatic invo=
cation is slicker, but the portability is the real story. We finally have a=
 way to package complex expertise that works across every AI platform.
Think about what that means. All those hard-won insights about how to struc=
ture a great pitch deck? How to evaluate vendors without getting burned? Ho=
w to build financial models that actually work? That knowledge has been tra=
pped in your head because it was too complex to turn into prompts. Now it h=
as a home.
So what am I giving you? Ten super prompt skills I built that cover the com=
plex work eating most of our time. I picked these to illustrate the sheer r=
ange of these skills.
Prompting Pattern Library - The 25+ patterns that actually work, with examp=
les=E2=80=94a huge help for building your own prompts and understanding wha=
t makes AI tick
Pitch Deck Builder - Investor presentations that tell the right story=E2=80=
=94focused on narrative, data, and lots of best practice around deck buildi=
ng
AI Vendor Evaluation - A framework to avoid the costly mistakes 95% of AI p=
rojects make=E2=80=94get your build vs. buy correct!
Excel Editing - How to modify complex existing workbooks without breaking e=
verything=E2=80=94lots of specific guidance to avoid common AI mistakes
Excel Big File Automation - Building complex multi-tab financial models the=
 right way
Resume Builder - Complete system for ATS-optimized resumes that get past th=
e robots
Job Search Strategist - A strategist tool that treats job search like a go-=
to-market problem, not spray-and-pray=E2=80=94super thoughtful about target=
ing jobs
Requirements Elicitation - Bridging the gap between PM docs and engineering=
 implementation=E2=80=94surfaces missing technical details before they beco=
me problems
Vibe Coding - A conversational builder to help you vibe code with tools lik=
e Cursor and Lovable (pitfalls included)
Agentic Development - How to actually build software with AI agents without=
 losing your mind
These represent years of expertise I=E2=80=99ve accumulated that was way to=
o complex to put into a prompt before. The financial modeling approaches I =
learned the hard way. The vendor evaluation frameworks from watching too ma=
ny bad deals. The job search strategies from helping dozens of people land =
roles. All of it finally has a place to live.
And the time savings? They=E2=80=99re real. Presentations that used to take=
 45-60 minutes of back-and-forth? Now 15 minutes. Financial models that ate=
 up 90 minutes? Down to 30. Vendor evaluations that took half a day? Under =
an hour.
This article breaks down:
Why this is the biggest leverage gain for AI work this year
How Skills work in Claude (automatic) vs ChatGPT/Gemini (manual but still p=
owerful)
The principles for building your own Skills
Real numbers on time saved across different types of work
How this is completely different from Custom GPTs and Gemini Gems
What=E2=80=99s actually inside each of the 10 skills
In six months, everyone doing knowledge work will have skill libraries. You=
=E2=80=99re getting a head start with 10 production-grade skills that handl=
e the most time-intensive work.
This is how we stop rewriting the same prompts and finally get real leverag=
e from AI on hard problems. Let=E2=80=99s go.

PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These are different from regular prompts you copy-paste. Each skill is a zi=
p file containing a structured markdown document with instructions, plus su=
pporting resources like examples, templates, frameworks, and sometimes even=
 executable code. Think of them as complete training manuals rather than si=
ngle instructions.
In Claude, you upload skills once through Settings =E2=86=92 Capabilities, =
and that=E2=80=99s it=E2=80=94Claude automatically invokes them when releva=
nt to your conversation. You don=E2=80=99t think about them, you don=E2=80=
=99t tag them, they just work in the background. You=E2=80=99re having a no=
rmal conversation, and when you mention something about creating a presenta=
tion or evaluating a vendor, Claude loads the relevant skill and uses it.
In ChatGPT or Gemini, you attach the zip file directly to your conversation=
 (just like uploading any other file), then explicitly tell the AI to use i=
t: =E2=80=9CUsing the instructions in this file, help me create a financial=
 model for X.=E2=80=9D The model opens the zip, reads the complete instruct=
ion set and all the supporting materials, and follows them.
The knowledge transfer is identical across platforms=E2=80=94Claude=E2=80=
=99s automatic invocation is more elegant and invisible, but ChatGPT and Ge=
mini get access to the same expertise when you reference the file. The key =
difference: in Claude you upload once and forget, in other platforms you at=
tach per conversation and explicitly tell the AI to use it. Either way, you=
=E2=80=99re giving the AI a complete playbook instead of explaining everyth=
ing from scratch every time.

T!
Anthropic released Skills [ https://substack.com/redirect/776da530-dd31-485=

Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ] yesterday, and this might be the most important productivity=
 release of 2025. Not because Claude got smarter - it didn=E2=80=99t. But b=
ecause we now have a way to do genuinely hard work with AI without carrying=
 the crushing weight of prompt engineering every single time.
Here=E2=80=99s what changed: before Skills, doing complex work with AI mean=
t writing elaborate prompts. Every. Single. Time. Need a sophisticated fina=
ncial model? 500-word prompt. Comprehensive vendor evaluation? Another 500 =
words explaining your framework. PowerPoint with specific structure and bra=
nding? You=E2=80=99re writing an essay about how to make slides before you =
even get to what the slides should say.
The cognitive load was enormous. You were simultaneously trying to explain =
how to do the work and what the work should contain. Skills separate those =
concerns. They handle the how so you can focus entirely on the what.
Why This Is a 10x Moment
Let=E2=80=99s be concrete about what we=E2=80=99re talking about. Creating =
a comprehensive quarterly business review presentation used to require:
Explaining your brand guidelines and formatting preferences (3-4 paragraphs=
)
Describing your preferred presentation structure and information hierarchy =
(2-3 paragraphs)
Specifying chart styles, font choices, and visual design principles (2 para=
graphs)
Detailing how you want data presented and what types of analysis to include=
 (2-3 paragraphs)
Then finally: what this specific presentation is about and what story it sh=
ould tell
You=E2=80=99re spending 80% of your prompt on methodology and 20% on substa=
nce. And if the result isn=E2=80=99t quite right? You=E2=80=99re either rev=
ising that massive prompt or starting over.
With Skills, that same task becomes: =E2=80=9CCreate a Q3 business review f=
ocused on customer retention. The narrative should emphasize our success in=
 enterprise accounts and ongoing challenges in SMB. Use the cohort analysis=
 from Sheet 3.=E2=80=9D
The skill already knows your brand guidelines, your structural preferences,=
 your formatting standards, your analytical frameworks. You=E2=80=99re prom=
pting only on the substance - what makes this presentation different from e=
very other presentation. Your cognitive energy goes to the work that matter=
s: the story you=E2=80=99re telling, the decisions you=E2=80=99re driving, =
the insights you want to surface.
This isn=E2=80=99t a small improvement. This is getting hours back on every=
 complex task.
A financial model that used to take three rounds of prompting and revision =
- maybe 45 minutes of work - now takes one clear prompt and 10 minutes. A v=
endor evaluation that required reconstructing your entire evaluation framew=
ork each time - maybe an hour of work - now takes 15 minutes. A comprehensi=
ve job search strategy that meant multiple chats with context reconstructio=
n between each - potentially 2-3 hours spread across days - now happens in =
a single 30-minute session.
Multiply that across every complex task you do regularly. Weekly presentati=
ons. Monthly reports. Quarterly analyses. Due diligence on vendors. Resume =
updates for job searches. Complex Excel models. Strategic planning document=
s.
We=E2=80=99re talking about days of time back per month for people doing kn=
owledge work.
The Big Question: Does This Make Prompting Irrelevant?
No. I had to put that in like a headline lol
There will be bad takes about this, but the truth is that prompting as a sk=
ill continues to increase in value, and that includes this release.
I always say prompting is an evolving art as the models evolve.=20
In this case, the value on prompt intent is actually increased with this la=
unch:
You need very clear intent to build these skills
You need to know your skill well to know what=E2=80=99s NOT in it
You need to be very clear with your prompt to drive the skill correctly
Remember a clear prompt is not always long!=20
The higher value the task, the more work goes into the prompt (still)
So am I gonna stop writing and sharing prompts? No.=20
Do I think prompt tools are dead? Absolutely not. But I bet I see bad takes=
 about that other places.=20
The bottom line is these skills or super prompts are non-linearly valuable:=
 they=E2=80=99re like a Honda Accord for ok prompters, a Ferrari for good p=
rompters, and a rocket for excellent prompters. The payoff to prompting ski=
ll remains exponential, and this release reinforced that dynamic.=20
How This Actually Works: The Claude Implementation
The technical architecture is elegant. Skills are folders containing instru=
ctions, examples, and resources. At startup, Claude loads only the skill na=
mes and brief descriptions - maybe 20-30 tokens per skill. This is what Ant=
hropic calls =E2=80=9Cprogressive disclosure.=E2=80=9D
When you start a conversation, Claude scans your query against those skill =
descriptions. If it detects relevance, it loads the full skill content - bu=
t only for that specific skill, and only the parts it needs. This keeps tok=
en usage efficient while giving Claude access to effectively unlimited cont=
ext about how to do specific types of work.
The automation is what makes this powerful. You don=E2=80=99t tag skills or=
 remember to invoke them. You just describe what you need, and if a relevan=
t skill exists, Claude uses it. The model figures out which skills matter f=
or your task and coordinates between them if multiple skills are relevant.
Say you ask for a financial presentation. Claude might invoke three skills =
automatically: your financial analysis framework (which explains how you wa=
nt numbers analyzed and presented), your presentation guidelines (which han=
dles structure and formatting), and your brand standards (which ensures vis=
ual consistency). You didn=E2=80=99t specify any of this. The model connect=
ed the dots.
This is the difference between a tool and infrastructure. A tool requires y=
ou to remember it exists and choose when to use it. Infrastructure just wor=
ks in the background, making everything you do more effective.
How This Works in Other Platforms (The Part Nobody=E2=80=99s Talking About)
Here=E2=80=99s what most coverage is missing: these skills aren=E2=80=99t C=
laude-exclusive. They=E2=80=99re markdown files in a standard folder struct=
ure. Which means they work in ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other AI that can rea=
d files.
The implementation is different. In ChatGPT, you upload the skill zip file =
to a conversation and explicitly reference it: =E2=80=9CUsing the guideline=
s in this file, help me create a financial model for X.=E2=80=9D ChatGPT re=
ads the complete instruction set and follows it. Same with Gemini.
The difference is convenience versus universality. Claude=E2=80=99s automat=
ic invocation is more elegant - you don=E2=80=99t think about skills, you j=
ust benefit from them. But ChatGPT=E2=80=99s approach is more flexible - yo=
u can use different skills in different conversations, mix and match based =
on the specific task, or try out a new skill before committing to it in you=
r Claude setup.
Both approaches work. The knowledge transfer is identical. You=E2=80=99re g=
iving the model the same detailed instructions, examples, and context - jus=
t through different interfaces.
This portability matters because it means skills are infrastructure, not a =
feature. They=E2=80=99re a pattern for working with AI that transcends any =
single platform. Build a skill once, use it everywhere.
The Principles of Good Skills
The question everyone asks: what should be a skill versus what should just =
be a prompt?
The heuristic is simple: if you would create onboarding materials for a per=
son doing this work, make it a skill.
Think about bringing a new employee onto your team. What would you give the=
m? Standard operating procedures. Examples of good work. Common pitfalls to=
 avoid. Your mental frameworks for approaching problems. Organizational con=
text they need to be effective.
That=E2=80=99s what a skill is. It=E2=80=99s onboarding materials for AI.
Good skills share common characteristics:
They=E2=80=99re specific enough to drive consistent behavior. Vague instruc=
tions like =E2=80=9Cwrite professionally=E2=80=9D don=E2=80=99t help. Speci=
fic frameworks like =E2=80=9Cuse the SCQA structure: Situation, Complicatio=
n, Question, Answer=E2=80=9D give the model something concrete to follow.
They=E2=80=99re comprehensive about methodology without being prescriptive =
about content. A presentation skill should specify exactly how to structure=
 slides and format visuals. It should not specify what to say on those slid=
es - that=E2=80=99s what your prompt provides.
They=E2=80=99re example-rich. Show what good looks like. If you have a hous=
e style for financial analysis, include example analyses. If you have prefe=
rred chart formats, include template images. Models learn better from examp=
les than from abstract rules.
They=E2=80=99re opinionated. The model needs clear direction, not a menu of=
 options. Don=E2=80=99t say =E2=80=9Cyou could structure this several ways.=
=E2=80=9D Say =E2=80=9Cstructure it this way, because X.=E2=80=9D Justified=
 opinions are better than endless flexibility.
They handle the parts of the work that stay consistent across instances. Yo=
ur brand guidelines don=E2=80=99t change between presentations. Your financ=
ial analysis methodology doesn=E2=80=99t change between models. Your vendor=
 evaluation criteria don=E2=80=99t change between assessments. That=E2=80=
=99s what belongs in skills.
The boundaries matter. Skills are for recurring work that=E2=80=99s complex=
 enough to benefit from structured guidance and high-value enough to justif=
y the setup time. One-off tasks don=E2=80=99t need skills. Simple tasks don=
=E2=80=99t need skills. Low-stakes experimentation doesn=E2=80=99t need ski=
lls.
But for the work that matters - the complex, recurring, high-value work tha=
t makes up most of knowledge work - skills change the game entirely.
Building Skills: The Practical Path
You have two paths to creating skills. The first is asking Claude to build =
them for you. Claude has built-in skill creation capabilities - you describ=
e what you want, it asks clarifying questions, you provide examples and con=
text, it builds the skill structure. This takes 15-30 minutes for a solid s=
kill.
The second is building manually, which gives you more control. The structur=
e is straightforward: a folder containing a SKILL.md file (with YAML frontm=
atter specifying name and description, followed by markdown instructions) p=
lus any supporting resources. The instructions are written like documentati=
on - clear, specific, example-rich.
The real skill in building skills is understanding what to include. You wan=
t enough detail to drive consistent behavior without so much detail that th=
e instructions become overwhelming. You want examples that illustrate the p=
rinciples without being so specific that they constrain the model=E2=80=99s=
 ability to adapt to different contexts.
The best skills I=E2=80=99ve seen balance three elements: principles (the w=
hy behind how you approach this work), frameworks (the specific methodology=
 you follow), and examples (what good execution looks like). Principles pro=
vide grounding, frameworks provide structure, examples provide clarity.
One refinement strategy I=E2=80=99ve found effective: build the skill in Cl=
aude, then evaluate it in ChatGPT or another model. Upload the skill and as=
k: =E2=80=9CReview this skill for completeness and quality. What=E2=80=99s =
missing? What could be clearer? What assumptions aren=E2=80=99t stated?=E2=
=80=9D Different models notice different gaps. Take that feedback back to C=
laude and iterate.
What You Get: The Time Savings Are Real
Let=E2=80=99s be specific about the leverage gain. I=E2=80=99ve been using =
skills intensively since Anthropic started testing them, and the time savin=
gs compound quickly.
Weekly recurring tasks: Presentation creation used to take 45-60 minutes in=
cluding prompt refinement. Now takes 15-20 minutes. That=E2=80=99s 30-40 mi=
nutes back per week, or 26-34 hours per year on just this one task type.
Monthly analyses: Financial modeling and analysis used to take 90-120 minut=
es including context reconstruction and multiple revision rounds. Now takes=
 30-40 minutes. That=E2=80=99s 60-80 minutes back per month, or 12-16 hours=
 per year.
Quarterly strategic work: Comprehensive strategy documents or board present=
ations used to take 3-4 hours of AI-assisted work spread across multiple se=
ssions. Now takes 90 minutes in a single focused session. That=E2=80=99s 6-=
10 hours back per quarter, or 24-40 hours per year.
One-time but complex projects: Vendor evaluations, job search strategy, maj=
or analytical projects - these used to take 2-4 hours of AI work with exten=
sive prompt engineering. Now take 45-60 minutes. Even at just 4 of these pe=
r year, that=E2=80=99s 6-13 hours back.
Add it up across all your complex recurring work: you=E2=80=99re looking at=
 70-100+ hours back per year. That=E2=80=99s 2-2.5 work weeks of time that =
was previously spent on prompt engineering and context reconstruction.
More importantly, the work quality becomes consistent. You=E2=80=99re not h=
aving good days and bad days based on how well you prompted. You=E2=80=99re=
 getting reliably good output because the methodology is standardized.
The Bigger Picture: This Changes How Teams Work
The individual productivity gain is significant. The team-level impact is t=
ransformative.
Before skills, AI expertise was locked in individuals. Some people figured =
out how to get great results for specific tasks. Others struggled. Knowledg=
e transfer meant sharing prompts, which often didn=E2=80=99t work well beca=
use prompts are context-dependent. What works brilliantly for one person in=
 their workflow might fail for someone else in a different context.
Skills change this dynamic. When someone figures out how to consistently ge=
t excellent results for a business-critical task, that knowledge becomes ca=
pturable and distributable. Marketing teams can build skills for brand-comp=
liant content. Finance teams can build skills for analytical frameworks. Pr=
oduct teams can build skills for user research synthesis.
The expertise becomes institutional instead of individual. New team members=
 don=E2=80=99t have to reinvent effective approaches - they inherit them th=
rough skills. Teams develop shared language and methodology around how to l=
everage AI for different types of work.
This compounds. A team with a library of 10-15 well-designed skills for the=
ir core workflows has effectively 10x=E2=80=99d their collective AI leverag=
e. Every person on that team is working at a higher baseline of effectivene=
ss.
Where This Goes
Skills are infrastructure. They=E2=80=99re not the end state - they=E2=80=
=99re the foundation for what comes next.
Right now, skills handle methodology and context. The natural evolution is =
skills that handle more of the orchestration for complex multi-step work. A=
 comprehensive due diligence skill that doesn=E2=80=99t just explain the ev=
aluation framework but actively coordinates data gathering, analysis, and s=
ynthesis across multiple work streams.
The portability matters for this evolution. Because skills work across plat=
forms, the ecosystem will develop outside Anthropic=E2=80=99s direct contro=
l. Someone will build better skill authoring tools. Someone will create ski=
ll testing frameworks. Someone will launch skill marketplaces. The format i=
s too simple and too useful not to spawn an entire ecosystem.
For now, the opportunity is simpler: identify your most complex, most recur=
ring work. The tasks where you=E2=80=99re spending hours on prompt engineer=
ing and context reconstruction. The work where quality and consistency matt=
er. Build skills for those tasks.
The time you invest in building a good skill - 30-60 minutes - pays back wi=
thin 3-5 uses of that skill. Everything after that is pure leverage.

mplates, and career stage customization. Includes decision trees for whethe=
r you=E2=80=99re creating from scratch, reviewing, or tailoring for specifi=
c roles. Contains actual working templates and formatting standards that pa=
ss applicant tracking systems. Turns the 2-3 hour resume refinement process=
 into a 30-minute focused session, and handles the complexity of tailoring =
resumes for different industries without starting from scratch each time.
AI Vendor Evaluation
Systematic framework for evaluating AI vendors to avoid costly mistakes, wi=
th red flag checklists, pricing model analysis, and contract term evaluatio=
n. Built on analysis of $1.2M average AI spending patterns and includes str=
uctured scorecards. Saves days of due diligence work and helps you avoid th=
e 95% of AI projects that fail due to poor vendor selection - potentially s=
aving tens of thousands in wasted spending.

 insights, conversational skills matching, and weighted prioritization mode=
ls. Includes KPI tracking and an operating rhythm for daily/weekly activiti=
es. Contains frameworks for discovering non-obvious company insights throug=
h web search and creative application strategies that bypass the noise of t=
raditional applications. Transforms the scattershot =E2=80=9Cspray and pray=
=E2=80=9D approach into a targeted, measurable system that surfaces the rig=
ht opportunities faster.
Prompting Pattern Library

ly giving you the accumulated wisdom of hundreds of hours of prompt enginee=
ring in a reusable format.
Excel Editor
Specialized workflows for editing existing Excel files while preserving for=
mulas, formatting, and multi-tab relationships. Emphasizes analysis before =
editing and includes validation frameworks to ensure completeness. Critical=
 for anyone working with existing financial models, dashboards, or complex =
workbooks where breaking formulas or losing data relationships would be dis=
astrous. Turns risky, error-prone manual Excel editing into a systematic pr=
ocess that maintains integrity.
Complex Excel Builder

rafting a compelling pitch deck and compresses it into focused sessions wit=
h structured frameworks that ensure you hit all the critical elements inves=
tors expect.
Requirements Builder
Systematic framework for analyzing product documents (PRDs, feature specs, =
user stories, roadmaps) to identify gaps and generate clarifying questions =
for PMs and engineers. Helps bridge the gap between PM documents and implem=
entation by surfacing missing technical details rather than making assumpti=
ons. Prevents costly rework by catching specification gaps before developme=
nt starts - potentially saving weeks of build time and multiple revision cy=
cles.
Each skill represents 20-50 hours of expertise distilled into a reusable fo=
rmat. They=E2=80=99re starting points - you=E2=80=99ll want to customize th=

FAQ: How Are Skills Different from Custom GPTs?
Q: I=E2=80=99ve been using Custom GPTs. Why would I switch to Skills?
The fundamental difference is architectural: Custom GPTs are conversational=
 agents you talk to. Skills are tools that enhance your main conversation.
With Custom GPTs, if you need help with brand-compliant financial presentat=
ions, you=E2=80=99d need three separate GPTs: one for brand guidelines, one=
 for financial analysis, one for presentation creation. You=E2=80=99d have =
to jump between three different chat windows, copy context between them, an=
d manually coordinate their outputs. Each GPT is its own silo.
With Skills, you have one conversation with Claude. You say =E2=80=9Ccreate=
 a financial presentation following our brand guidelines=E2=80=9D and Claud=
e automatically loads the brand skill, the financial analysis skill, and th=
e presentation skill. They compose together seamlessly. You=E2=80=99re not =
managing multiple agents - you=E2=80=99re working with one AI that has acce=
ss to multiple specialized knowledge bases.
Q: Can=E2=80=99t I just upload my Custom GPT instructions to Claude?
Yes, and that=E2=80=99s the portability advantage. Your Custom GPT is locke=
d into ChatGPT=E2=80=99s ecosystem. A Skill is just a zip file - you can us=
e it in Claude with automatic invocation, upload it to ChatGPT for manual r=
eference, use it in Gemini, or even build your own tools around it. The for=
mat is open and simple.
Q: What about the composability difference?
This is the killer feature. Custom GPTs don=E2=80=99t stack. If you=E2=80=
=99ve built a =E2=80=9CFinancial Analysis GPT=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9CBrand=
 Guidelines GPT=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9CPresentation GPT,=E2=80=9D you can=
=E2=80=99t combine them. You=E2=80=99re picking one and living with its lim=
itations, or manually copying outputs between agents.
Skills stack automatically. Claude looks at your request, identifies which =
skills are relevant, and loads them all. A presentation request might invok=
e five skills: brand guidelines, financial frameworks, data visualization p=
references, writing style, and presentation structure. You didn=E2=80=99t s=
pecify any of them - the composition happened automatically based on contex=
t.
This is the difference between tools and agents. Tools compose. Agents don=
=E2=80=99t.
FAQ: How Are Skills Different from Gemini Gems?
Q: I use Gemini Gems for specialized tasks. How is this different?
Gems, like Custom GPTs, are separate conversational agents. When you create=
 a Gem for =E2=80=9CEmail Writer=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CCode Reviewer,=E2=80=
=9D you=E2=80=99re creating a specialized version of Gemini you switch to w=
hen you need that capability. Each Gem is its own conversation context.
Skills are embedded context, not separate agents. You don=E2=80=99t switch =
to a =E2=80=9Cpresentation skill=E2=80=9D - you stay in your main conversat=
ion, and Claude loads the presentation expertise when needed. This matters =
because you can combine multiple skills in a single task without context sw=
itching.
Q: Can I use Skills in Gemini?
Yes, but not with the automatic invocation Claude provides. You=E2=80=99d u=
pload the skill zip file to a Gemini conversation and reference it explicit=
ly: =E2=80=9CUsing the guidelines in this file, help me with X.=E2=80=9D Ge=
mini reads the instructions and follows them. It=E2=80=99s manual invocatio=
n versus automatic, but the knowledge transfer works.
This portability is the key difference from Gems, which only work in Gemini=
=E2=80=99s ecosystem. Skills work everywhere because they=E2=80=99re just s=
tructured instruction files.
Q: Why does the tool vs. agent distinction matter?
Because tools compose and agents don=E2=80=99t.
Say you need to evaluate an AI vendor, create a presentation about your fin=
dings, and ensure it follows your company=E2=80=99s brand guidelines. With =
Gems, you=E2=80=99d need to use three different Gems sequentially, copying =
context and outputs between them. The =E2=80=9CVendor Analysis Gem=E2=80=9D=
 doesn=E2=80=99t know about your brand guidelines. The =E2=80=9CBrand Guide=
lines Gem=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t know your analytical frameworks.
With Skills, all three concerns are addressed in one conversation. Claude i=
nvokes the vendor evaluation skill to structure your analysis, the presenta=
tion skill to format outputs, and the brand guidelines skill to ensure visu=
al compliance. The composition happens automatically because Skills are too=
ls the AI can combine, not separate agents you have to coordinate.
Q: So Skills are better than Gems in every way?
Not necessarily. Gems are easier to set up initially - you just describe wh=
at you want in plain language. Skills require a bit more structure (though =
Claude can build them for you).
But for complex work where you need multiple types of expertise simultaneou=
sly, Skills are dramatically more powerful. The composability and portabili=
ty advantages compound quickly. If you=E2=80=99re doing serious knowledge w=
ork where you regularly need multiple specialized capabilities in a single =

rks: The Claude Implementation</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The technical architecture =
is elegant. Skills are folders containing instructions, examples, and resou=
rces. At startup, Claude loads only the skill names and brief descriptions =
- maybe 20-30 tokens per skill. This is what Anthropic calls =E2=80=9Cprogr=
essive disclosure.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When you start a conversation, =
Claude scans your query against those skill descriptions. If it detects rel=
evance, it loads the full skill content - but only for that specific skill,=
 and only the parts it needs. This keeps token usage efficient while giving=
 Claude access to effectively unlimited context about how to do specific ty=
pes of work.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The automation is what makes this powerful. Yo=
u don=E2=80=99t tag skills or remember to invoke them. You just describe wh=
at you need, and if a relevant skill exists, Claude uses it. The model figu=
res out which skills matter for your task and coordinates between them if m=
ultiple skills are relevant.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Say you ask for a financial pr=
esentation. Claude might invoke three skills automatically: your financial =
analysis framework (which explains how you want numbers analyzed and presen=
ted), your presentation guidelines (which handles structure and formatting)=
, and your brand standards (which ensures visual consistency). You didn=E2=
=80=99t specify any of this. The model connected the dots.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
This is the difference between a tool and infrastructure. A tool requires y=
ou to remember it exists and choose when to use it. Infrastructure just wor=
ks in the background, making everything you do more effective.</p><h2 class=

 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here=E2=80=99s what most coverage is missing: these=
 skills aren=E2=80=99t Claude-exclusive. They=E2=80=99re markdown files in =
a standard folder structure. Which means they work in ChatGPT, Gemini, or a=
ny other AI that can read files.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The implementation is diff=
erent. In ChatGPT, you upload the skill zip file to a conversation and expl=
icitly reference it: =E2=80=9CUsing the guidelines in this file, help me cr=
eate a financial model for X.=E2=80=9D ChatGPT reads the complete instructi=
on set and follows it. Same with Gemini.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The difference is =
convenience versus universality. Claude=E2=80=99s automatic invocation is m=
ore elegant - you don=E2=80=99t think about skills, you just benefit from t=
hem. But ChatGPT=E2=80=99s approach is more flexible - you can use differen=
t skills in different conversations, mix and match based on the specific ta=
sk, or try out a new skill before committing to it in your Claude setup.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">Both approaches work. The knowledge transfer is identical. Yo=
u=E2=80=99re giving the model the same detailed instructions, examples, and=
 context - just through different interfaces.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This portabil=
ity matters because it means skills are infrastructure, not a feature. They=
=E2=80=99re a pattern for working with AI that transcends any single platfo=
rm. Build a skill once, use it everywhere.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-po=

0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You have two=
 paths to creating skills. The first is asking Claude to build them for you=
. Claude has built-in skill creation capabilities - you describe what you w=
ant, it asks clarifying questions, you provide examples and context, it bui=
lds the skill structure. This takes 15-30 minutes for a solid skill.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">The second is building manually, which gives you more control. Th=
e structure is straightforward: a folder containing a SKILL.md file (with Y=
AML frontmatter specifying name and description, followed by markdown instr=
uctions) plus any supporting resources. The instructions are written like d=
ocumentation - clear, specific, example-rich.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The real skil=
l in building skills is understanding what to include. You want enough deta=
il to drive consistent behavior without so much detail that the instruction=
s become overwhelming. You want examples that illustrate the principles wit=
hout being so specific that they constrain the model=E2=80=99s ability to a=
dapt to different contexts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The best skills I=E2=80=99ve se=
en balance three elements: principles (the why behind how you approach this=
 work), frameworks (the specific methodology you follow), and examples (wha=
t good execution looks like). Principles provide grounding, frameworks prov=
ide structure, examples provide clarity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">One refinement str=
ategy I=E2=80=99ve found effective: build the skill in Claude, then evaluat=
e it in ChatGPT or another model. Upload the skill and ask: =E2=80=9CReview=
 this skill for completeness and quality. What=E2=80=99s missing? What coul=
d be clearer? What assumptions aren=E2=80=99t stated?=E2=80=9D Different mo=
dels notice different gaps. Take that feedback back to Claude and iterate.<=

gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Be=
fore skills, AI expertise was locked in individuals. Some people figured ou=
t how to get great results for specific tasks. Others struggled. Knowledge =
transfer meant sharing prompts, which often didn=E2=80=99t work well becaus=
e prompts are context-dependent. What works brilliantly for one person in t=

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">Skills change this dynamic. When someone figures out how to consiste=
ntly get excellent results for a business-critical task, that knowledge bec=
omes capturable and distributable. Marketing teams can build skills for bra=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

The natural evolution is skills that handle more of the orchestration for c=

m Custom GPTs?</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q: I=E2=80=99ve been using Custom G=
PTs. Why would I switch to Skills?</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The fundamental=
 difference is architectural: Custom GPTs are conversational agents you tal=
k to. Skills are tools that enhance your main conversation.</p><p style=3D"=
margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
>With Custom GPTs, if you need help with brand-compliant financial presenta=
tions, you=E2=80=99d need three separate GPTs: one for brand guidelines, on=
e for financial analysis, one for presentation creation. You=E2=80=99d have=
 to jump between three different chat windows, copy context between them, a=
nd manually coordinate their outputs. Each GPT is its own silo.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">With Skills, you have one conversation with Claude. You say =E2=80=9Cc=
reate a financial presentation following our brand guidelines=E2=80=9D and =
Claude automatically loads the brand skill, the financial analysis skill, a=
nd the presentation skill. They compose together seamlessly. You=E2=80=99re=
 not managing multiple agents - you=E2=80=99re working with one AI that has=
 access to multiple specialized knowledge bases.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q:=
 Can=E2=80=99t I just upload my Custom GPT instructions to Claude?</strong>=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">Yes, and that=E2=80=99s the portability advantage. Your Cu=
stom GPT is locked into ChatGPT=E2=80=99s ecosystem. A Skill is just a zip =
file - you can use it in Claude with automatic invocation, upload it to Cha=
tGPT for manual reference, use it in Gemini, or even build your own tools a=
round it. The format is open and simple.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q: What ab=
out the composability difference?</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is the kill=
er feature. Custom GPTs don=E2=80=99t stack. If you=E2=80=99ve built a =E2=
=80=9CFinancial Analysis GPT=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9CBrand Guidelines GPT=
=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9CPresentation GPT,=E2=80=9D you can=E2=80=99t combi=
ne them. You=E2=80=99re picking one and living with its limitations, or man=
ually copying outputs between agents.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Skills stack automati=
cally. Claude looks at your request, identifies which skills are relevant, =
and loads them all. A presentation request might invoke five skills: brand =
guidelines, financial frameworks, data visualization preferences, writing s=
tyle, and presentation structure. You didn=E2=80=99t specify any of them - =
the composition happened automatically based on context.</p><p style=3D"mar=

fferent?</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Gems, like Custom GPTs, are separate conv=
ersational agents. When you create a Gem for =E2=80=9CEmail Writer=E2=80=9D=
 or =E2=80=9CCode Reviewer,=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99re creating a specialized =

its own conversation context.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Skills are embedded context, =
not separate agents. You don=E2=80=99t switch to a =E2=80=9Cpresentation sk=
ill=E2=80=9D - you stay in your main conversation, and Claude loads the pre=
sentation expertise when needed. This matters because you can combine multi=
ple skills in a single task without context switching.</p><p style=3D"margi=

 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Yes, but not wi=
th the automatic invocation Claude provides. You=E2=80=99d upload the skill=
 zip file to a Gemini conversation and reference it explicitly: =E2=80=9CUs=
ing the guidelines in this file, help me with X.=E2=80=9D Gemini reads the =

lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This portability is =
the key difference from Gems, which only work in Gemini=E2=80=99s ecosystem=
. Skills work everywhere because they=E2=80=99re just structured instructio=
n files.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q: Why does the tool vs. agent distinction=
 matter?</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Because tools compose and agents don=E2=
=80=99t.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Say you need to evaluate an AI vendor, create a pr=
esentation about your findings, and ensure it follows your company=E2=80=99=
s brand guidelines. With Gems, you=E2=80=99d need to use three different Ge=
ms sequentially, copying context and outputs between them. The =E2=80=9CVen=
dor Analysis Gem=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t know about your brand guidelines.=
 The =E2=80=9CBrand Guidelines Gem=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t know your analy=
tical frameworks.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">With Skills, all three concerns are addre=
ssed in one conversation. Claude invokes the vendor evaluation skill to str=
ucture your analysis, the presentation skill to format outputs, and the bra=
nd guidelines skill to ensure visual compliance. The composition happens au=
tomatically because Skills are tools the AI can combine, not separate agent=
s you have to coordinate.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q: So Skills are better t=
han Gems in every way?</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Not necessarily. Gems are e=
asier to set up initially - you just describe what you want in plain langua=
ge. Skills require a bit more structure (though Claude can build them for y=
ou).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">But for complex work where you need multiple types of =
expertise simultaneously, Skills are dramatically more powerful. The compos=
ability and portability advantages compound quickly. If you=E2=80=99re doin=
g serious knowledge work where you regularly need multiple specialized capa=
bilities in a single task, Skills change the game in ways Gems can=E2=80=99=
t match.</p><div class=3D"subscription-widget-wrap" style=3D"font-size: 16p=
