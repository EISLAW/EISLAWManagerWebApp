DAILY MEMO: INDIA BANS PAKISTANI IMPORTS [3]
TENSIONS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED SINCE LAST MONTH'S ATTACK IN KASHMIR.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
MORE ESCALATION. India said on Sunday that it would ban all imports of goods coming from or transiting through Pakistan [4] in response to the deadly attack last month in Pahalgam. It will also block
Pakistan-registered vessels from entering Indian ports and Indian ships from docking at Pakistani ports. India also cut the flow of water [5] through the Baglihar Dam, located on the Chenab River near
the Pakistan border. It’s the first time water flow has been cut since the signing of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates the allocation of water resources between the two countries and
which India suspended after the Pahalgam incident.
AMMUNITION SHORTAGE. Relatedly, according to India’s ANI news agency [6], Pakistan has been left with just four days' worth of reserve ammunition due to the country’s recent arms sales to Ukraine.
State-owned defense firm Pakistan Ordnance Factories' outdated production facilities have reportedly struggled to replenish stocks amid surging global demand. The country is particularly low on
supplies of 155mm artillery shells, which were sold to Ukraine.
MEDIATORS. Moscow and Tehran are attempting to mediate between the two sides. According to a Russian statement [7], Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for a diplomatic settlement during a phone
call with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, on Friday. On Monday, Pakistan’s ambassador to Moscow told Russia’s TASS news agency [8] that his country was in constant contact with Russian
officials on the matter. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister will visit Pakistan on Monday, ostensibly to discuss bilateral relations and regional developments. According to Iranian media [9], Abbas
Araghchi will also visit India later this week. And in a recent call with the Pakistani prime minister, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tehran was ready to help reduce tensions [10] between
the two countries. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council, which currently counts Pakistan as a non-permanent member, will reportedly hold a closed session [11] to discuss the issue, at Pakistan’s
request.
GAZA OPERATION. Israel has approved a plan [12] to expand its military operation in Gaza. The plan reportedly includes provisions to "conquer" Gaza and retain the territory, though implementation will
be delayed until after U.S. President Donald Trump’s upcoming regional visit. It aims to end Hamas' control of the strip, move civilians southward and prevent the militant group from seizing
humanitarian aid. However, Israel’s military chief reportedly warned ministers that such an operation could endanger the lives of hostages still being held by Hamas. Relatedly, Israeli daily Haaretz
reported [13] that the Israeli army will begin calling up reservists as part of the operation. The reservists will deploy along Israel's northern borders and in the West Bank, replacing regular army
soldiers who will redeploy to the strip.
HOUTHI RETALIATION. A missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels struck Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Sunday [14]. The group said it would continue to target Israeli airports in response to
Israel’s plans to expand operations in Gaza. The Israeli Cabinet convened on Sunday to discuss the attack, reportedly agreeing to respond in coordination with the United States.
SYRIA STRIKE. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Turkish warplanes were scrambled during an Israeli airstrike on targets in Syria on May 2, Turkey’s Sozcu newspaper reported [15]. Turkish F-16s
reportedly sent warning signals to the Israeli jets using electronic warfare systems. Bases operated by two Turkish-backed Syrian militant groups, Sultan Murad and Suleiman Shah, were the reported
targets of the Israeli strike.
MORE SYRIAN DEVELOPMENTS. U.S. troops have mostly withdrawn from two bases in Syria’s eastern Deir el-Zour province, Al Arabiya reported [16]. All U.S. soldiers have left the base at the Conoco gas
field, while about 50 remain at Al-Omar oil field, where more than 60 tanks loaded with military equipment were seen departing last week. Meanwhile, Turkiye Gazetesi reported [17] that Ankara plans to
launch a diplomatic campaign against the presence of Kurdish militants in Syria this summer to correspond with the ongoing U.S. withdrawal. According to the publication, Turkey is already conducting
bilateral and multilateral consultations on the matter, including with Russia.
OIL MARKET. OPEC+ countries have agreed to increase oil output for a second consecutive month, pledging to raise production in June by 411,000 barrels per day. According to sources who spoke to
Reuters [18], Saudi Arabia is pushing to speed up the reversal of previous cuts to “punish” fellow OPEC members – namely Iraq and Kazakhstan – for not complying with production quotas. The
increase also follows calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for OPEC to increase production and comes ahead of his planned visit to Saudi Arabia in May.
AZERBAIJAN TRIP. Amid these developments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed his visit to Azerbaijan. In a statement [19], the prime minister’s office said Netanyahu decided to
reschedule the trip due to events in Gaza and Syria, as well as other political events and security measures.
ESCALATION IN SUDAN. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a drone strike [20] against the city of Port Sudan on Sunday, the Sudanese army said. It was the first attack on the city, the de
facto capital of the Sudanese junta government, since the outbreak of war in the country over two years ago. The Sudanese army accused the United Arab Emirates of involvement in the attack.
SOUTHEAST ASIAN COOPERATION. The finance chiefs and central bank governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations held a summit in Italy over the weekend [21]. Representatives from Japan, China
and South Korea also attended. In a joint statement, the countries said the region’s economic outlook was “subject to heightened uncertainties,” an apparent reference to U.S. tariffs. They
pledged to promote regional trade and investment.
RUSSIA AND JAPAN. Russia’s ambassador to Tokyo, Nikolai Nozdrev, said in an interview with TASS news agency [22] that Japan’s “accelerated militarization” and promotion of military alliances
in the Asia-Pacific would lead to military tensions and an arms race in Northeast Asia. He also accused Japan of becoming increasingly involved in extended deterrence schemes involving U.S. nuclear
weapons.
