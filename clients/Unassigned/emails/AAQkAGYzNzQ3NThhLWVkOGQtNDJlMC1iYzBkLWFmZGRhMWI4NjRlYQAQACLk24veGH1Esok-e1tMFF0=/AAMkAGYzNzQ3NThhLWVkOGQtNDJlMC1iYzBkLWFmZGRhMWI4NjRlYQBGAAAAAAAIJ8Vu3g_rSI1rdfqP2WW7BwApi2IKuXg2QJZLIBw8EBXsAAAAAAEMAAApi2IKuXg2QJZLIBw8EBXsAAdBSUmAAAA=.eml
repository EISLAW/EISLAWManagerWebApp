A single research paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/f3d397e8-53df-4d09-=

tAjMRMPOw0 ] from Apple just broke the internet. And frankly, both sides of=
 the resulting flame war are missing the point.
I=E2=80=99m so tired, guys. I get that the internet is the greatest narrati=
ve simplification machine to ever exist. I grew up online in the 90=E2=80=
=99s (and earlier, you don=E2=80=99t earn those gray hairs for nothin=E2=80=
=99).
But even factoring in the usual internet-leaps-to-conclusions, this was bad=
=2E And I gotta say as much as I want t=
o avoid ad hominen (or ad corporatum)=20=
attacks here, it is very very tempting to make this about the fact that the=
 company that cannot make Siri work properly is issuing a nasty paper title=
d =E2=80=9CThe Illusion of Thinking=E2=80=9D to dunk on people doing the ac=
tual work and producing excellent models.=20
I just had a fantastic 20 minute conversation with OpenAI=E2=80=99s new Adv=
anced Voice Mode [ https://substack.com/redirect/80026b5d-a1d8-4fef-9460-0d=
d3106ea7c9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMP=
Ow0 ] today. It=E2=80=99s really really good. Siri could not do this.
But! But we don=E2=80=99t do those kinds of attacks here because of two rea=
sons: 1) the researchers aren=E2=80=99t to blame for all of Apple=E2=80=99s=
 problems with AI, and 2) it=E2=80=99s just a silly reason to avoid learnin=
g from a useful paper.=20
So my view is let=E2=80=99s dig in, understand what happened here, and unde=
rstand what we can actually learn from the paper that is making people clai=
m AI is over, AI is dead, etc. This is an example of where the discourse is=
 at:
No. It=E2=80=99s not. And flame wars aren=E2=80=99t helping anybody. So let=
=E2=80=99s actually understand what=E2=80=99s happening and learn.=20
Dig in to this article and you=E2=80=99ll get: what Apple actually did, wha=
t everybody is missing about the paper, and how it will actually help you b=
uild better AI solutions day-to-day. And if you=E2=80=99re not building in =
AI, learning this stuff is gonna help strengthen your memetic immune system=
 so you don=E2=80=99t fall for the next AI-is-dead meme.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
What Apple Actually Did
Here's what happened. Apple's research team wanted to test whether "reasoni=
ng" language models actually reason, or just look like they do. So they bui=
lt the cleanest possible experiment.
They took four frontier models=E2=80=94Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and OpenAI=
's o3-mini=E2=80=94and tested them on custom puzzle suites. No Google searc=
hes. No Python code execution. No external tools. Just the raw model, a gen=
erous token budget for "thinking," and puzzles that can be dialed from triv=
ial to impossible.
The puzzles were designed to be contamination-proof. Tower of Hanoi with 3 =
disks, 4 disks, 5 disks. River crossing with different numbers of people an=
d constraints. Checker jumping games of increasing complexity. Clean mathem=
atical problems where you can crank the difficulty one notch at a time.
Anyway, what they found broke into three clear regimes:
Low complexity: Plain models without "thinking" actually beat the reasoning=
 models. Why? The thinking models overthought simple problems and talked th=
emselves out of correct answers.
Medium complexity: Reasoning models dominated. The extra thinking tokens he=
lped them explore and course-correct.
High complexity: Both collapsed completely. And here's the kicker=E2=80=94w=
hen accuracy crashed, so did the length of the thinking traces. The models =
didn't just get wrong answers. They stopped trying. I have also had this fe=
eling on hard problems so same, AI, same.
Apple called this the "reasoning cliff." I call it needing more coffee. Onc=
e the search space hits a critical size, models give up even when they have=
 plenty of tokens left to think with. Here=E2=80=99s the reasoning cliff:
Not to be fair, I don=E2=80=99t know if I could solve Tower of Hanoi with 1=
0 disks either. Maybe, but I=E2=80=99ve never tried. I bet I definitely cou=
ldn=E2=80=99t with 20.
The Internet Loses Its Mind
The response of the internet has been absolutely wild.
One camp screamed: "Apple just proved AI reasoning is fake! It's all an ill=
usion! The emperor has no clothes!" Tech Twitter exploded with "I told you =
so" posts and premature obituaries for the entire field.
The other camp fired back: "This is meaningless! Real AI systems use tools!=
 Who cares about naked models when we have RAG and code execution and searc=
h?" They dismissed the whole paper as irrelevant to actual AI products.

Both sides are missing what actually matters for anyone building real syste=
ms.
The Real Issue: LLMs Need a Lifeline
I'm not here to bury AI. I=E2=80=99m here to help you figure out the actual=
 practical applications of papers like this under the hype. Apple's Illusio=
n of Thinking paper shows you exactly where single-pass chain-of-thought mo=
dels break.=20
Put another way, the paper shows you where a model breaks when it has no he=
lp at all, and needs to make quick decisions. And that boundary matters eve=
n if=E2=80=94especially if=E2=80=94you're building systems with external to=
ols.
Think of it this way: every production AI system needs a lifeline. The ques=
tion isn't whether your LLM can solve every problem alone=E2=80=94it's whet=
her it knows when to pull the cord.
That cliff Apple found? It's the exact moment your system needs to escalate=
=2E And getting that timing right is everything.
Here's why this "lifeline" framing matters:
The escalation decision is itself reasoning. Choosing when to call a planne=
r, when to grab a calculator, when to search the web=E2=80=94that's a reaso=
ning step. If your base model quietly stops thinking at depth 8, it might n=
ot reliably decide when to pull the parachute. You'll get confident wrong a=
nswers instead of graceful escalation.
Latency budgets force hard choices. Every lifeline costs milliseconds and t=
okens. In voice assistants with 300ms budgets, you can't afford to discover=
 the model is drowning after it's already sunk. You need to know the depth =
limit upfront and trigger backup systems before you hit it.
Edge deployments can't phone home. Cars, medical devices, field tablets=E2=
=80=94they need to work offline. Apple's cliff tells you exactly what compl=
exity you can promise without a cloud connection. Beyond that line, you eit=
her pre-cache solutions or tell users "I'll get back to you when we're onli=
ne."
The illusion is dangerous. Apple's key insight isn't just that models fail=
=E2=80=94it's that they fail while sounding confident. The chain-of-thought=
 doesn't gradually degrade. It stays coherent right up until it vanishes. I=
f your safety systems trust that confident-sounding trace, you're flying bl=
ind.
Yes, tools and search push the cliff outward. Yes, they handle harder cases=
=2E They also multiply compute 5-10x an=
d import new failure modes. At product=
ion scale, that's the difference between a viable product and a science pro=
ject.
Here's what I actually care about:
The next leap isn't a bigger model or flashier agents. It's architecting sy=
stems where LLMs know exactly when they're out of their depth, can prove it=
 cheaply, and can escalate gracefully without hallucinating competence alon=
g the way.
Apple just handed us the depth meter for naked models. Beyond the hype, tha=
t=E2=80=99s a very handy baseline. Everything else=E2=80=94planners, retrie=
vers, code execution=E2=80=94is a lifeline you pull when you hit that line.=
 Know where the line is, budget for crossing it, and design the escalation =
before your customers drive off the edge.
Where The Cliff Hits Your Roadmap
Let me get concrete. Here are four scenarios where this boundary destroys r=
eal products:
Voice Assistants That Can't Afford a Thinking Pause
Apple's stress test shows the raw model stalls once a plan requires more th=
an ~8 steps. Your smart speaker that suddenly needs Tree-of-Thoughts to unt=
angle "split that lasagna recipe for six vegetarians and two keto guests" w=
ill burn milliseconds of gold-plated inference.
Industry studies peg the end-to-end latency budget at =E2=89=A4300ms for sn=
appy voice UX. Tree-of-Thoughts can flip 4% success into 74% on Game-of-24 =
[ https://substack.com/redirect/f22de80b-1e09-4b13-95d9-2a79337f803c?j=3Dey=
J1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94but=
 only after dozens of rollouts. If your base model caves at depth 9, your s=
peaker either stutters or ships the wrong answer.=20
And yes I know most people are asking these models to set kitchen timers by=
 voice right now=E2=80=94but getting them to where we can trust them more w=
ill take this kind of escalation firepower.
On-Device Copilots in the Dash
Cars, AR headsets, medical scanner consoles=E2=80=94anything that must work=
 offline=E2=80=94can't stream five extra passes to a data center every time=
 a plan grows one hop deeper.
Edge-AI engineers already fight to keep all model inference inside the sili=
con envelope for safety and privacy. Apple's cliff line is the load limit: =
if the naked LLM chokes at depth-8 on Hanoi Tower, you know how complex a n=
avigation query can be before you either force a cloud round-trip or tell t=
he driver "I'll get back to you."
Real-Time Fraud Screens and Trade Bots
A bank's chat analyst flagging suspicious transfers needs deterministic lat=
ency and deterministic failure modes. If the model's chain-of-thought evapo=
rates past a certain graph depth, the agent may both miss the red flag and =
emit a confident rationale. This is a problem for evals frameworks, since i=
t can lead to false negatives (or false passes of the evals framework).
Tool-calling can patch the miss=E2=80=94at the cost of unpredictable comput=
e spikes that wreck throughput forecasts for high-volume hours. Apple's bou=
ndary lets risk teams simulate worst-case load instead of guessing.
Enterprise Chatbots Where Every Token Is Money
Inference-time search methods like A*-Decoding [ https://substack.com/redir=
ect/45ff9eba-ff01-4d74-b2d6-2f064b7dff59?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxP=
mLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] hit Llama-3-1B with structured search a=
nd match 70x larger models=E2=80=94using 3x fewer tokens. Impressive. Those=
 tokens are still ~70% more than single-shot mode.
If your SaaS support bot fields a million tickets daily, that delta lands o=
n the invoice. Apple's cliff tells ops exactly when "just think harder" fli=
ps from profitable to loss-making and forces them to budget for smarter pru=
ning or domain-specific heuristics.
Why These Examples Matter
Apple didn't kill AI. They drew the first clear contour line around single-=
pass reasoning. Whether you're squeezing under a 300ms latency cap, shippin=
g fully-offline UX, or running an LLM farm with a CFO breathing down your n=
eck, that contour is now part of your architecture brief.
Ignore it, and your product works=E2=80=94right up to depth 9, right up to =
the first edge-case customer, right up to the quarter your cloud bill tripl=
es. Measure it, and you can plan the exact moment the agent grabs a planner=
, spins up retrieval, or politely says "I'll get back to you."
Why the Cliff Is Still Your Problem Even With Tools
Myth: "My agentic stack calls a planner, so the base-model cliff is irrelev=
ant."
Reality: That planner call costs latency and tokens. If the base model sile=
ntly stops thinking on tougher inputs, it may mis-decide when to invoke the=
 tool, nuking your reliability budget.
Myth: "Latency doesn't matter, I'm fine with slow."
Reality: Fine=E2=80=94until you need on-device or edge mode. Car dashboards=
, wearables, field-ops tablets can't stream ten extra passes to a GPU farm.=
 Know your naked-model limit. Know what you can promise offline.
Myth: "Safety is handled by RAG + guardrails."
Reality: Apple's key warning is the illusion: the model keeps emitting conf=
ident prose right up to the point it gives up. If your guardrail trusts tha=
t trace, you're flying blind.
Tools hide the cliff. They don't eliminate it. And they import new failure =
modes=E2=80=94tool selection, cost blowouts, attack surface=E2=80=94on top =
of the old one.
What the Viral Doom Posts Get Wrong
They collapse a boundary into a eulogy. Apple drew a map that says "Here be=
 dragons beyond depth=3D8." The internet meme machine translated that to "H=
ere be the edge of the world."
They ignore the contamination twist. Apple's own math-benchmark section con=
cedes that part of the gap between "thinking" and "plain" models might simp=
ly be dataset leakage=E2=80=94memorization masking weakness. That knife cut=
s both ways: it shrinks the triumph of LRMs on AIME-25 and it shrinks the p=
anic that they suddenly became useless.
They pretend tooling is free. Every "Just add search!" reply glosses over t=
he 5-10x inference-flop price tag reported by Tree-of-Thoughts, A*-Decoding=
, and other long-horizon methods. Those costs matter at production scale.
What the "Nothing to See Here" Crowd Gets Wrong
Latency and unit economics still rule the real world. Fast answers subsidiz=
e slow ones. If your base model collapses on 10% of inputs, you just torche=
d your margin or your SLA.
Meta-reasoning is still reasoning. Deciding which tool to call, when, and w=
ith what arguments is itself a reasoning task. If the inner loop is brittle=
, the wrapper inherits that brittleness.
Interpretability debt is compounding. Apple's trace evaporation shows we ca=
n't trust surface narrative. Anthropic's open-source circuit tracer and Ope=
nAI's logit-lens work are racing to expose what's really happening, but clo=
sed-weight frontier models remain opaque. Treating them as black boxes plus=
 band-aids is a long-term governance risk.
The Architecture That Actually Matters
I'm not interested in declaring AI "dead." I'm not satisfied with "tools fi=
x everything."
Here's what I care about:
The next leap in AI isn't bigger models or flashier agents. It's architecti=
ng systems where LLMs know exactly when they're out of their depth, can pro=
ve it cheaply, and can escalate gracefully without hallucinating competence=
 along the way.
Apple just handed us a stress test that isolates where naked models break. =
That's your lifeline trigger point, but just knowing it hits issues at dept=
h-8 in a lab environment isn=E2=80=99t the same as having a reliably effect=
ive framework for figuring out how to deploy cost-efficient models at scale=
=2E
My takeaway is this: We desperately need more thinking around frameworks fo=
r model escalation.
We just don=E2=80=99t have a common framework for that. We don=E2=80=99t ev=
en have common agreement on what that means. We don=E2=80=99t have dialup f=
rameworks that help us figure out which model to call when across what comp=
lexity graph. We need those. Designing smart AI systems means treating them=
 as complex systems with risk parameters.
We should thank Apple for pointing out the risk parameters, admit we chuckl=
e just a bit at Apple for failing to ship Siri, and then recognize this as =
a valuable paper that is pointing out a risk parameter we can heed and de-r=
isk with hard work.
So let=E2=80=99s get to it.
The race isn't to build models that never need help. It's to build systems =
that know when to ask for it, can do it fast, and can do it gracefully.
Stop arguing about whether the cliff exists. Start building better lifeline=
s.

n custom puzzle suites. No Google searches. No Python code execution. No ex=
ternal tools. Just the raw model, a generous token budget for &quot;thinkin=

tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=

i with 3 disks, 4 disks, 5 disks. River crossing with different numbers of =
people and constraints. Checker jumping games of increasing complexity. Cle=

 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>La=

seconds and tokens. In voice assistants with 300ms budgets, you can't affor=

 isn't just that models fail=E2=80=94it's that they fail while sounding con=
