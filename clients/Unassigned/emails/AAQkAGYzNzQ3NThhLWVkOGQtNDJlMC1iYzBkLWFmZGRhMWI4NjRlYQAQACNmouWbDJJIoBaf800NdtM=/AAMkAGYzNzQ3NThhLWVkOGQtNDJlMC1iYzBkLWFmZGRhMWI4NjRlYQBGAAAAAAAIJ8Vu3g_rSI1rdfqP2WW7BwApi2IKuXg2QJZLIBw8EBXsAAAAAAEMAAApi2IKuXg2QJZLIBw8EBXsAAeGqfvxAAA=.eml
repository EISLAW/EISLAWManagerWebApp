You know the beginning of this story, but the ending isn=E2=80=99t written =
yet.=20
Juniors are in trouble by most measures, and starting a career in tech has =
never been harder.
People like to blame AI, but the reality is more complicated: some companie=
s are using AI as an excuse, while others are using AI to build (and includ=
e Juniors).
I=E2=80=99ve seen both, and I know a LOT of earlier career folks.=20
So this post is for you if you=E2=80=99re getting started or trying to brea=
k into tech! I=E2=80=99ve got my honest war stories, what companies need to=
 hear, real strategies I=E2=80=99ve seen work, plus (yes) a real list of co=
mpanies that are being loud about hiring juinors.=20
So make this post yours! Share it with those hungry for work, add your advi=
ce at the end. Look at the stories I=E2=80=99ve seen that really do work.=
=20
Let=E2=80=99s make this a rich post with real tales of the struggles (and s=
uccesses) of finding tech roles in 2025.
I believe in a world where junior talent has an honored place in tech, and =
I want to share some of the stories I=E2=80=99ve heard here and start worki=
ng together to make it happen. Some of the best builders and developers I k=
now have been juniors=E2=80=94AI can=E2=80=99t replace you guys!=20
So share your story, share this post with someone who needs it, and let=E2=
=80=99s start building a better world together.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Yes, it=E2=80=99s real=E2=80=A6
Let me validate what you're experiencing first. Computer science graduates =
now face 6.1% unemployment, nearly double the national average. Entry-level=
 positions require an average of 4.5 years of experience. Big Tech has cut =
new graduate hiring by 50% over five years. Those are real numbers, and I c=
an=E2=80=99t wave my hand and fix them.
I=E2=80=99ve talked with a couple of dozen early career folks over the past=
 two months and the TLDR is: "It's terrible and you can't get interviews. A=
nd if you do get interviews, it's AI conducting the interviews and it's an =
absolutely soulless process." One shared they'd sent out 400 applications a=
nd gotten three callbacks=E2=80=94all automated rejections after AI screeni=
ng.
This isn't because you're not good enough. It's because the system for reco=
gnizing talent is fundamentally broken.
Why AI broke promises on hiring
For decades, I could look at a junior's messy but passionate side project a=
nd see potential. Experienced builders could spot hunger in how someone app=
roached problems. But AI has destroyed these signals. When every resume is =
perfect and every portfolio is polished by AI, how do you stand out?
Ironically, here=E2=80=99s the thing: companies still desperately need raw,=
 hungry talent. They need people who obsess over problems at 2 AM because t=
hey can't let go. That conviction has never gone out of style. The problem =
isn't that companies don't want you=E2=80=94it's that they can't find you i=
n all the AI-generated noise.=20
This is like dolphins trying to navigate in a sea of ship noises: we=E2=80=
=99re all lost and disoriented because of the cacophony. We need signal to =
find our pod.=20
But I'm seeing juniors who've cracked the code. Let me tell you about someo=
ne who succeeded by doing the opposite of what everyone else was doing.
One of one is annoying because it works
This person obsessed over the intersection of sales enablement and entrepre=
neurship. Instead of sending generic applications, they created custom vide=
os for that specific niche. They didn't try to be broadly impressive=E2=80=
=94they became the obvious choice for a specific problem.
They had absolutely obsessive focus.
Another junior I know specialized in AI automations for a super-specific ba=
ck office automation problem space. They can tell you all about trading off=
 n8n and Zapier and Make for that particular use case. When companies in th=
at space need someone, their name comes up immediately.
Whatever your specialty is, get one. Pick one. Double down on it. Make your=
self one of one for something. You're not competing on the variables everyo=
ne else is maximizing. You're finding your own game.
Companies doing it right
Not everyone is using AI as an excuse to avoid hiring juniors. I'm seeing c=
ompanies that get it=E2=80=94they're creating exceptions in their requireme=
nts: "You need X years of experience unless you're AI-native and can prove =
it." They recognize that hunger plus AI-native thinking beats experience al=
one.
One startup I know specifically opened their doors to junior talent with th=
e requirement that they demonstrate AI proficiency. They figured out that i=
njecting AI-native blood into their culture was worth more than years of tr=
aditional experience. Their junior hires are now outperforming many of thei=
r senior engineers on AI-integrated projects.
Another company started a "junior pod" system where three juniors work toge=
ther with one senior mentor, using AI tools to multiply their effectiveness=
=2E The juniors bring fresh perspective=
s and AI fluency, the senior provides=20=
domain expertise and judgment. It's working brilliantly.
The Junior edge
Here's what senior engineers walking away from tech won't tell you: Many of=
 them are choosing retirement rather than learning AI. I know multiple engi=
neers and PMs who don't want to deal with the AI transition at this stage i=
n their careers. They're opening coffee shops, taking up woodworking=E2=80=
=94anything but another paradigm shift.
This is your opportunity. While they're walking away, you're native to this=
 new world. You don't have to unlearn 20 years of habits. You can partner w=
ith AI naturally because you grew up with it.
Companies are starting to realize what happens when senior talent leaves an=
d there's no pipeline. With average tech tenure at just 2-2.5 years, smart =
companies are asking: "What happens when that role is vacant and we need so=
meone who knows the business AND knows how to work with AI agents?"
A way forward
1. Find Your Intersection Don't be a generic "full-stack developer" or "pro=
duct manager." Be the person who does [specific thing] for [specific indust=
ry] using [specific approach]. Make it so narrow that when someone needs ex=
actly that, you're the only name that comes up.
2. Build in Public Don't just build projects=E2=80=94document your process.=
 Show your thinking. It doesn=E2=80=99t have to be software. It does have t=
o be noisy. Let people see how you approach problems. One junior I know got=
 hired because a CTO saw their debugging process in a blog post and thought=
, "That's exactly the kind of thinking we need."
3. Skip the Line Stop playing the application game everyone else is playing=
=2E Find the people doing interesting w=
ork in your niche and engage with thei=
r content. Offer to solve a specific problem they mentioned. Show up consis=
tently in their field of vision.
4. Prove Your AI Partnership Don't just say you can work with AI=E2=80=94sh=
ow it. Build something that demonstrates how you think about AI as a partne=
r, not just a tool. Companies want to see that you can leverage AI while ma=
intaining human judgment and creativity.
The future is people building products (still)
People build products for people. People take care of people. Even Klarna h=
ad to reverse their AI-only customer service because customers didn't feel =
cared for. We're always going to need humans who can deliver value while pa=
rtnering with AI agents.
The companies investing in junior talent now=E2=80=94finding ways to identi=
fy and develop raw potential despite the signal problem=E2=80=94will have a=
n insurmountable advantage in two years. Those that don't will scramble to =
fill roles with no developed pipeline.
This isn't charity. It's smart business. The most AI-native generation is t=
he one currently being locked out. But that's changing, one hire at a time,=
 one success story at a time.
Your turn!
I believe in a world where junior talent has an honored place in tech. Not =
because it's nice, but because it's necessary. The best builders and develo=
pers I know started as hungry juniors who got a chance.
So here's my ask:
If you're a junior who broke through, share your story in the comments. Wha=
t worked? What didn't? What do you wish you'd known?
If you're struggling, share that too. Let's problem-solve together. Someone=
 reading this might have exactly the insight you need.
If you're hiring and you've found creative ways to identify junior talent, =
tell us about it. Be the example other companies need to see.
If you know someone who needs to read this, share it with them. Sometimes k=
nowing you're not alone in the struggle makes all the difference.
The tech world still needs you. Not all companies have realized it yet, but=
 they will. Your job is to be ready when they do, to find the ones who alre=
ady get it, and to help build the future where junior talent is valued agai=
n.
You can play this game. You can stand out. You can get hired. It's happenin=
g every day=E2=80=94I'm seeing it. Yes, the game is harder than it used to =
be. But you're also smarter, more connected, and more capable than any gene=
ration of juniors before you.
Let's figure this out together. Drop your stories, your struggles, your suc=
cesses below. Let's make this the resource every junior in tech needs to se=
e.
Good luck. And I mean that=E2=80=94genuine well-wishing from someone who kn=
ows exactly how hard this is, but also knows you're going to make it.
The ending of this story isn't written yet. Let's write it together.
Share your story below. Tag someone who needs to see this. Let's build a be=
tter tech world, one junior hire at a time.

Real Companies Hiring AI-Native Juniors: Who's Actually Creating Opportunit=
ies
IBM Apprenticeship Program
IBM runs a comprehensive 5-year-old apprenticeship program that specificall=
y targets career-changers without traditional degrees. They're committed to=
 skilling 2 million learners by 2028 through their SkillsBuild program. The=
 program is full-time, paid, and focuses on AI and cloud engineering skills=
 rather than credentials.
Accenture
Accenture has integrated GenAI practices into their high-school and early-c=
areer workforce programs, including their "Learning to Lead" initiative for=
 high school juniors, seniors, and recent graduates. They're working with t=
he U.S. Department of Labor to develop scalable tech/AI-fluent apprenticesh=
ips.
AI-First Startups Creating New Models
OpenAI
OpenAI launched Grove, a groundbreaking 5-week mentorship program specifica=
lly for "pre-idea" founders - people who haven't even formed a concrete bus=
iness concept yet. The first cohort includes about 15 participants who rece=
ive mentorship, early access to models, and hands-on workshops at OpenAI's =
SF headquarters.
OpenAI is also launching a jobs platform and an AI fluency certification sh=
ortly, so stay tuned here.
Hugging Face
Hugging Face actively recruits entry-level positions and runs an internship=
 program explicitly stating "Applicants from all backgrounds are welcome!".=
 They emphasize that they're "intentionally building a workplace where peop=
le feel respected and supported=E2=80=94regardless of who you are or where =
you come from".
Innovative Startup Programs
Drafted
This AI-powered hiring platform, founded by Andrew Kozlovski and Rodrigo Pe=
cchio, has partnered with 3,500+ companies including Google, Amazon, DoorDa=
sh, and numerous Y Combinator startups. They specifically posted a job for =
an Entry-Level AI Engineer stating: "We care about curiosity, creativity, a=
nd a builder mindset" and offering "Remote-first work, mentorship, rapid up=
skilling opportunities, equity + competitive salary".
Skillfully
Partnering with Anthropic's Claude AI, Skillfully has created an innovative=
 hiring platform that uses AI-powered job simulations instead of resumes. T=
hey're specifically helping first-generation college students and community=
 college graduates access opportunities at major employers like Bloomberg, =
reducing hiring costs by 70% and focusing on demonstrated skills over crede=
ntials.
Reclaim.ai
While currently not hiring, Reclaim.ai previously recruited for Senior Java=
 Engineers but explicitly stated they're "always looking for talented, scra=
ppy and ambitious people", backed by top venture firms including Index Vent=
ures and Gradient Ventures.
Apprenticeship and Training Programs
Apprenti AI Program
In partnership with NC State's AI Academy, Apprenti launched the first nati=
onwide registered AI apprenticeship program in the U.S., expecting to scale=
 to 5,000 apprenticeships annually. The program is designed for full-time w=
orking adults with no career pause required.
Mentors in Tech (MinT)
Founded in 2020, MinT has served 1,200 student mentees with a remarkable 75=
% job placement rate within 6 months at an average salary of $95,000. They =
partner with community colleges and smaller universities, specifically targ=
eting "non-traditional" students who are often working in retail, hospitali=
ty, or other industries while studying.
Google AI Programs
Google has committed to training young Americans through various initiative=
s including partnerships with Junior Achievement and the Digital Storytelli=
ng Academy. They're also running their Cloud AI Accelerator for pre-seed st=
artups.
SAP STAR Apprenticeships
SAP offers vocational programs in 13 countries for university students, wit=
h two-year programs in Australia/New Zealand and partnerships with universi=
ties in Ireland, Germany, and the U.S.
The "Junior Pod" System in Action
Several companies are implementing the junior pod model:
Bloomberg uses Skillfully's platform to transform campus recruiting at HBCU=
s, giving candidates access to job simulations before recruiting events
ServiceNow provides AI development opportunities to 250+ Americans per year=
 through internal internship programs
Multiple Y Combinator startups report that 25% of their winter 2025 class g=
enerated nearly all their code using AI tools, with juniors working alongsi=
de AI as partners
Companies Making Explicit Exceptions
The clearest example of "X years of experience unless you're AI-native" com=
es from the broader startup ecosystem where companies are posting requireme=
nts like:
"Recent graduate in Computer Science, AI/ML, Data Science, or related field=
" with emphasis on AI tool proficiency over years of experience
"AI-native young professionals" being hired and promoted rapidly, with some=
 earning up to $1 million annually according to WSJ reporting
Startups specifically seeking candidates who can "demonstrate AI proficienc=
y" rather than traditional experience metrics
(Yes, look for those phrases in your searches)
