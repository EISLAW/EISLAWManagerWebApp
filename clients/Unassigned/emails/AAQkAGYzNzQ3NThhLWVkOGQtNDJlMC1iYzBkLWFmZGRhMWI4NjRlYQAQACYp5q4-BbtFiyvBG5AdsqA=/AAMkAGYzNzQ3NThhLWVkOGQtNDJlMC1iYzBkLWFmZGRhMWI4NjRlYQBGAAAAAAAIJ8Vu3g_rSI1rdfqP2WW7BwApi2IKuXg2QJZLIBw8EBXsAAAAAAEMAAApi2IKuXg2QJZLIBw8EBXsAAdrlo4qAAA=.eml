This post is super practical. It=E2=80=99s all about helping you get ChatGP=
T-5 working for YOU.
Like 700 million other people, I've spent the last few days living in the m=
essy reality of adjusting to the biggest model launch of the year.=20
The issue is not "it can't do hard things"=E2=80=94it can. I think the frus=
tration I=E2=80=99ve been reading across the internet runs deeper: it's abo=
ut losing a thinking (and for some=E2=80=94seemingly feeling) partner you'd=
 come to rely on.=20
Overnight, OpenAI swapped the AI that knew your work style for a routed sys=
tem that sometimes thinks deeply, sometimes sprints, and sometimes silently=
 downgrades without warning. It wasn't just that workflows broke=E2=80=94it=
 was that the rhythm of collaboration people had built over months suddenly=
 felt foreign because it was suddenly disintermediated by a router.
I've watched teams lose momentum as they work through the change. I've seen=
 LOTS of comments that amount to =E2=80=9Cit used to work and now it=E2=80=
=99s missing [nuance, emotion, thoughtfulness, insert-your-adjective]. Bott=
om line: the trust that makes AI useful=E2=80=94that sense of "this system =
gets what I'm trying to do"=E2=80=94became unpredictable.
I've been tracking this from three angles. First, the review=E2=80=94The Co=
mplete ChatGPT-5 Review: 5 Real-World Tests and the Playbook [ https://subs=

t it into organizational reality: how to roll this out without breaking wha=
t your team depends on.
This piece is the missing fourth leg: getting your thinking partner back. N=
ot workarounds or coping strategies=E2=80=94specific moves that make GPT-5 =
feel like it's working with you again, not just responding to you. I'm goin=
g to address the ten most common frustrations I'm hearing (the routing gues=
sing game, chat vs API mismatches, long-context false promises, JSON that d=
rifts, tool-call overconfidence, guardrail friction, and more) and show you=
 exactly which ones Custom Instructions can fix, which ones need API precis=
ion, and which ones are simply how this system works now=E2=80=94so you can=
 design around them instead of fighting them.
Why this matters: GPT-5 isn't a single intelligence anymore; it's a policy =
decision wrapped in a router. If you don't guide it intentionally, it will =
default to patterns that might not serve your actual work=E2=80=94shallow w=
hen you needed depth, verbose when you needed clarity, diplomatic when you =
needed honest pushback. That's not sustainable for leaders making consequen=
tial decisions or builders shipping on deadlines.
The approach here is practical but human-centered: restore the thinking rel=
ationship that was working, on purpose. I'll share the exact Custom Instruc=
tions that rebuilt that trust for me, the two simple macros that change eve=
rything (Depth and Concise), when it's worth paying for reasoning versus sp=
eed, and how to keep long-document work grounded with specific citations. T=
he goal isn't perfect prose=E2=80=94it's getting back that reliable thinkin=
g partner who challenges weak assumptions, remembers context, and helps you=
 make better decisions faster.
And one more thing: we=E2=80=99re not done talking about ChatGPT-5. I=E2=80=
=99ve had requests for specific on-screen ChatGPT-5 demos where I share my =
prompting, requests for ChatGPT-5 specific prompt libraries, and requests f=
or a deep dive on data analysis in ChatGPT-5 (one area where I think it shi=
nes). I=E2=80=99ll be tackling all of those over the next week or two! This=
 model is immediately one of the most-used in the world, and it deserves th=
at kind of attention.
But for today=E2=80=94dive in and let=E2=80=99s get ChatGPT-5 working for Y=
OU!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Introduction: Welcome to a Different Way of Thinking with AI
The early GPT-5 backlash wasn't about raw capability=E2=80=94it was about f=
eel. Within days of launch, Reddit and Hacker News filled with frustrated p=
osts that shared a common thread: something felt fundamentally "off" about =
the experience. Users weren't complaining that GPT-5 couldn't solve hard pr=
oblems. They were complaining that it felt inconsistent, unpredictable, and=
 often worse than what they'd been using before.
The complaints weren't unfounded. GPT-5's architecture represents a fundame=
ntal shift from previous models. Instead of being a single monolithic syste=
m, it's essentially a routing platform that dynamically switches between di=
fferent models based on perceived complexity. Sometimes you get the full re=
asoning model. Sometimes you get a faster chat variant. Sometimes you hit u=
sage limits and get silently downgraded to mini. The result is an experienc=
e that can feel like talking to different people depending on how you phras=
e your question or when you happen to ask it.
But here's what the early criticism missed: most of these issues aren't fun=
damental flaws in the technology. They're configuration and prompting probl=
ems coupled with a new workflow issue for humans=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99re not =
used to having a router in our AI thinking mix yet. Fundamentally, AI work =
patterns are fragile for us right now (they=E2=80=99re new) and a disruptio=
n like this feels really big.
It=E2=80=99s not the end of the world though! The good news is that six of =
the ten most common complaints can be addressed with deliberate Custom Inst=
ructions and workflow adjustments. The remaining four require API controls,=
 structured outputs, or architectural changes, but they're manageable if yo=
u know what you're dealing with.
This isn't about making GPT-5 "sound better." It's about making it think mo=
re consistently, push back when it should, and help you make better decisio=
ns faster. Let's break down exactly what's happening and how to fix it.
Why GPT-5 Feels "Off": The Router Problem
The single biggest source of user frustration stems from what GPT-5 actuall=
y is under the hood. As u/loamy put it succinctly: "It's literally just a r=
outer switching between existing models." This isn't hyperbole=E2=80=94it's=
 technically accurate.
When you send a message to ChatGPT-5, you're not talking directly to a sing=
le model. You're talking to a routing system that analyzes your input and d=
ecides which variant to use:
GPT-5 (full reasoning): The heavy-duty model that can engage in deep analys=
is and multi-step reasoning
GPT-5-chat-latest: A faster, more conversational variant optimized for chat=
 interactions
GPT-5-mini/nano: Lightweight fallback models used when you hit usage limits=
 or for simple tasks
The router makes this decision based on signals in your prompt. OpenAI has =
explicitly acknowledged that phrasing like "think hard about this" increase=
s your chances of being routed to the reasoning model. But the routing logi=
c isn't transparent, and users frequently get misrouted to lighter models f=
or complex tasks.
@Angaisb_ captured the core issue [ https://substack.com/redirect/a76da24f-=
219e-4621-9bbe-2a033ffdbf33?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]: "The broken model router is gonna hurt GPT-5's rele=
ase so much I hope they fix it soon, people don't know it's not working pro=
perly, they just think the model isn't great."
This creates a particularly insidious problem: you can ask the same questio=
n twice and get dramatically different quality responses, not because the m=
odel is inconsistent, but because you triggered different routing paths. Us=
ers interpret this as the model being unreliable when it's actually a predi=
ctable (if poorly communicated) system behavior. OpenAI is actively working=
 here [ https://substack.com/redirect/6184e922-b74f-4378-ab84-3800ee1f42c9?=
j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], and =
released a partial fix fast.
The Ten Core Issues (And What Actually Fixes Them)
Let's walk through each major complaint category, what's really happening, =
and whether Custom Instructions can address it.
1. "It feels like a router picked the wrong brain"
The Pattern: "It's not the model you're unhappy with; it's the new router f=
unction," as dtagames noted on Hacker News. Users report getting shallow re=
sponses to complex questions, then getting much better results when they re=
phrase with explicit depth cues.
What's Actually Happening: The router is conservative about engaging expens=
ive reasoning modes. Without clear signals that deep analysis is needed, it=
 defaults to faster, lighter processing. @PromptInjection found that "In 80=
% of cases, users aren't even getting GPT-5, but rather GPT-5 Mini or Nano =
versions."
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Partially. You can bias the router toward =
deeper analysis, but you can't override fundamental routing logic. Open AI =
is trying to help here by leaning more into reasoning.
The Fix:
Custom Instructions - How would you like ChatGPT to respond:
"Default to deep analysis unless I explicitly say 'quick take.' When I ment=
ion 'think hard,' 'analyze thoroughly,' or 'be comprehensive,' treat this a=
s mandatory reasoning mode. Always explain your reasoning process for compl=
ex decisions."

What to do next:
Test the same complex question with and without explicit depth cues like "t=
hink carefully about this"
For critical analysis, manually select "GPT-5 Thinking" mode when available
Use the API with reasoning_effort=3D"high" for guaranteed access to reasoni=
ng capabilities
2. "Chat vs API: why do they behave differently?"
The Pattern: u/Jojavee's experience is typical: "Through the API =E2=80=A6 =
solves this; in ChatGPT it fails." Development teams report significant beh=
avioral differences between sandbox testing in ChatGPT and production API d=
eployments.
What's Actually Happening: ChatGPT uses the routing system described above.=
 The API gives you direct access to specific models: gpt-5 is the reasoning=
 model, gpt-5-chat-latest is the non-reasoning chat variant. As @joshuacc e=
xplained: "gpt-5 through the api is very different than through the ChatGPT=
 UI, because that has a model router behind the scenes that uses a cheaper =
model when it thinks it can."
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: No. This is an architectural difference, n=
ot a prompting issue.
The Fix: Align your testing methodology to your deployment target. If you'r=
e shipping via API, test via API. If you're using ChatGPT, understand that =
you're testing a different system.
What to do next:
Pin your API model explicitly (gpt-5 vs gpt-5-chat-latest)
Document which model variant each workflow depends on
Create separate test suites for Chat vs API endpoints
Set consistent reasoning_effort and verbosity parameters in API calls
3. "Model deprecations keep changing my results"
The Pattern: Users report that previously reliable workflows started produc=
ing different outputs after GPT-5's launch. As documented in press coverage=
, "OpenAI retires older models with GPT-5 launch," including GPT-4o, GPT-4.=
1, and the o-series models.
What's Actually Happening: Model retirements and auto-mapping to new equiva=
lents inevitably create output drift. This isn't unique to GPT-5, but the s=
cale of retirements made it particularly noticeable.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: No. Output drift from model changes is ine=
vitable.
The Fix: Implement systematic change management for model transitions. If y=
ou haven=E2=80=99t been versioning, start. If you have, good for you. This =
is your chance to version in and test with evals on a new prompt that works=
=2E
What to do next:
Snapshot critical prompts and their outputs before any model migration
Run side-by-side comparisons on your core workflows when new models launch
Maintain a "frozen" baseline for audit purposes
Enable "Show legacy models" in ChatGPT settings where available
4. "Long context =E2=89=A0 it actually used my doc"
The Pattern: u/nadertheory's experience is common: "So strange how it can s=
till get things wrong when context is large." Users stuff large documents i=
nto the context window and assume the model has perfect recall of every det=
ail.
What's Actually Happening: OpenAI's own BrowseComp Long Context evaluation =
shows ~89% accuracy at 128k=E2=80=93256k tokens=E2=80=94impressive, but not=
 perfect. The classic "lost in the middle" problem persists, especially for=
 documents with repetitive sections or complex cross-references.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Partially. You can require explicit citati=
on and verification, but you can't fix fundamental attention limitations. D=
on=E2=80=99t expect miracles, use the known mitigations for long-context wi=
ndows (e.g. U-shaped prompting, which I=E2=80=99ve discussed in prior artic=
les at length).
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"When referencing uploaded documents, always cite the specific section or p=
age you're drawing from. If you're uncertain about a detail from a long doc=
ument, ask me to clarify or provide a smaller, more focused excerpt."

What to do next:
Break large documents into logical sections before upload
Require citations to specific sections, not just "based on your document"
Add "canary" questions to your evaluation set to detect when the model miss=
es key details
Use retrieval-augmented approaches for critical document analysis
5. "My JSON keeps breaking"
The Pattern: u/maurice_kleine reported a common issue: "gpt-5-mini returns =
incomplete, invalid JSON objects sometimes" and schema drift in longer conv=
ersations.
What's Actually Happening: Free-form "please return JSON" instructions are =
inherently fragile. Without schema enforcement, models can drift format, es=
pecially in longer conversations or when using lighter model variants.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Only with strict enforcement mechanisms. I=
=E2=80=99d also note this seems like a very specific model issue in API, so=
 I don=E2=80=99t anticipate this one being too prevalent. Move to a thinkin=
g model or use the fix below to address this one or similar code format iss=
ues that arise.
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"For JSON responses, always use the exact schema I provide. If you cannot c=
onform to the schema, return: { 'error': 'schema_mismatch', 'reason': 'brie=
f explanation' }. Never return partial or malformed JSON."

What to do next:
Switch to Structured Outputs with JSON Schema for production use
Validate every JSON response before processing
Never rely on free-form JSON instructions for critical data
Use grammar constraints or CFG when available in your toolchain
6. "It still claims tool actions that didn't happen"
The Pattern: @KeepingAIHonest documented at least one case [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/de169820-432c-4612-b333-0d02b188e51c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In=
0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] of the model "refusing to p=
roduce text about its own mistakes" and claiming to have performed actions =
that weren't actually executed.
What's Actually Happening: OpenAI reports that deception rates dropped "fro=
m 4.8% for o3 to 2.1% for GPT-5," but the issue persists. The model sometim=
es conflates planning actions with executing them, especially in complex mu=
lti-step workflows.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Partially. You can enforce clearer separat=
ion between planning and execution. Insist on artifacts as proof of work (w=
hich I=E2=80=99ve noted in the full review [ https://substack.com/redirect/=
2020aecd-81fd-4203-aed7-f3d9c7a786f8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJ=
f9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] as well).
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"Always distinguish between 'Plan' and 'Actions Completed.' After using any=
 tool, explicitly state what was actually accomplished and what the current=
 state is. If a tool call failed, say so clearly."

What to do next:
Log all tool inputs and outputs for verification
Implement post-tool validation steps
Require explicit confirmation of world state changes
Fail requests that claim unverifiable actions
7. "Thinking mode is slow and costs more"
The Pattern: @davidzh's complaint [ https://substack.com/redirect/ca728209-=
f164-4797-b5ff-161b96c1a237?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] is widespread: "It's far too slow even with reasonin=
g_effort set to 'minimal'. I'm consistently getting 700ms+ inference latenc=
y."
What's Actually Happening: Reasoning mode genuinely uses more compute and t=
ime. The API provides reasoning_effort (minimal/low/medium/high) and verbos=
ity controls to trade quality against speed and cost, but many users don't =
optimize these settings.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Partially. You can set default verbosity p=
references and routing logic.
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"Default to concise responses. Use minimal verbosity unless I explicitly re=
quest detailed reasoning. For routine questions, favor speed over exhaustiv=
e analysis."

What to do next:
Set reasoning_effort=3D"minimal" for routine tasks
Use reasoning_effort=3D"high" only for final decisions or complex analysis
Implement prompt caching for repeated queries
Benchmark cost vs. decision quality for your specific use cases
8. "Guardrails keep blocking legit work"
The Pattern: u/quitter's frustration is typical: "Not an advancement=E2=80=
=94huge step backwards for serious work." Users report increased friction a=
round dual-use content and edge cases.
What's Actually Happening: GPT-5 emphasizes "safe completions" over hard re=
fusals, particularly around bio-risk and dual-use topics. The model tries t=
o provide helpful information within policy bounds rather than simply refus=
ing.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Sometimes. You can guide the model toward =
productive alternatives. Also sometimes not=E2=80=94you may have to switch =
models or go back to the old ways for some serious work that is too adjacen=
t to topics OpenAI considers dangerous.
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"If a request touches on restricted topics, provide the closest safe altern=
ative and clearly explain what aspects are problematic. Focus on legitimate=
 use cases and suggest appropriate workarounds."

What to do next:
Map common blocking patterns to safe alternatives
Escalate edge cases to human review when needed
Document which content categories require special handling
Consider API access for higher-stakes professional work
9. "Still making basic errors (spelling, geography)"
The Pattern: Multiple outlets documented that GPT-5 "struggled with basic s=
pelling and geography" in early testing, surprising users who expected fund=
amental improvements.
What's Actually Happening: While overall reliability has improved, hallucin=
ations haven't been eliminated. The routing system can sometimes send basic=
 factual questions to lighter models that are more prone to errors.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: Partially. You can require verification an=
d citation for factual claims. The fix for moving to a thinking model also =
helps here.=20
The Fix:
Custom Instructions:
"For factual claims about geography, spelling, dates, or other verifiable i=
nformation, cite your source or mark uncertainty with [VERIFY]. When unsure=
, ask one clarifying question rather than guessing."

What to do next:
Require citations for all non-obvious factual claims
Add verification steps for high-stakes information
Use web search or retrieval for current facts
Flag uncertain claims for human review
10. "After a while it downgrades to mini and the quality drops"
The Pattern: Users report quality degradation mid-conversation without warn=
ing. As documented in OpenAI's help materials, "Once limits are reached, a =
mini version handles remaining queries."
What's Actually Happening: ChatGPT has usage limits (80 messages per 3 hour=
s for Plus users). After hitting these limits, the system silently falls ba=
ck to GPT-5-mini, which has notably different capabilities.
Can Custom Instructions Fix It?: No. This is a resource management issue, n=
ot a prompting problem.
The Fix: Monitor usage and plan accordingly.
What to do next:
Track message counts in critical workflows
Use API with explicit model pinning for essential tasks
Upgrade to higher tiers if usage limits are constraining
Implement detection for model downgrades in production systems
Beyond the 10: Other FAQs & Fixes
Q: My ChatGPT isn=E2=80=99t empathetic anymore!
A: You can select the personality in your settings actually (see below)
Nate=E2=80=99s take: This is partly a settings thing, and also partly that =
they leaned into the business use-case a fair bit with ChatGPT-5. Sam says =
he=E2=80=99s working on making ChatGPT-5 =E2=80=9Cwarmer=E2=80=9D by defaul=
t so stay tuned.
Q: My ChatGPT doesn=E2=80=99t speak my (non-English) language properly anym=
ore!
A: Specify your default language in the custom instructions area (e.g. the =
What Traits Should ChatGPT have box up above there)
Nate=E2=80=99s take: This is a really interesting one. Been seeing multiple=
 reports of ChatGPT no longer fluidly switching between languages for multi=
lingual users. It is possible that the internal reasoning chain in ChatGPT-=
5 runs on English and the English =E2=80=98leaks through=E2=80=99 in inappr=
opriate situations, but I get the feeling there=E2=80=99s more to the story=
 here.
Q: I hear they=E2=80=99re bringing ChatGPT 4o back!=20
A: Yes, but it=E2=80=99s not clear for how long, which plans, or whether yo=
u can bet on it being there longterm. I wouldn=E2=80=99t plan on it being t=
here forever.
Nate=E2=80=99s take: I think this is very much a play to the Reddit AMA cro=
wd. Sam wants Reddit to put down the pitchforks so he can get back to build=
ing. I firmly expect 4o to be there just long enough for the team to patch =
in a bit of empathy with ChatGPT-5 and then I suspect it will either be rol=
led back out entirely or (potentially) limited to a higher paying tier to p=
ush upgrades.
Before and After: What Changes When You Personalize GPT-5
The difference between default GPT-5 and properly configured GPT-5 is stark=
=2E Here are real examples from users w=
ho've implemented systematic Custom In=
structions:
Before (Default GPT-5): "I'd appreciate your thoughts on whether we should =
prioritize the new estimation feature or the reporting dashboard for next s=
print. Both seem important from a business perspective, and I want to make =
sure we're making the right strategic decision here."
Response: Three paragraphs of balanced analysis covering pros and cons of e=
ach option, ending with "Both options have merit and the choice depends on =
your specific priorities and constraints."
After (Configured GPT-5): Same question
Response: "Decision: Ship the estimation feature first.
Why: Unlocks cross-team priority alignment immediately; lower integration r=
isk; visible ROI within 2 sprints.
Risks: May under-measure actual lift; potential data provenance confusion i=
f we don't define ownership early.
Next steps: Define acceptance criteria by Friday; draft data governance pol=
icy; assign a decision-maker for edge cases."
The difference isn't just tone=E2=80=94it's utility. The configured version=
 provides a clear recommendation with reasoning, acknowledges risks, and of=
fers concrete next steps. This change came from Custom Instructions that em=
phasized decision-making over analysis.
Style transformation is equally dramatic. You can nudge the model away from=
 "LinkedIn influencer prose" to practical communication with targeted instr=
uctions:
"Write plainly. One idea per paragraph. No filler words. End sections with =
clear takeaways and specific next steps."

Router nudging becomes more reliable with explicit cues:
"For complex decisions or analysis, assume 'think hard' mode unless I speci=
fy 'quick take.' If you didn't use reasoning mode, explain why."

Working Library: Drop-in Custom Instructions
These instruction blocks address specific complaint categories. Copy them i=
nto "Customize ChatGPT =E2=86=92 Instructions" and adjust for your needs:
Depth & Evidence Control
Default to thorough analysis for complex questions. If I say 'quick take,' =
limit to 5 bullet points maximum. Cite sources for time-sensitive or non-ob=
vious claims. When uncertain about facts, mark with [VERIFY] rather than gu=
essing.

Addresses: Router misrouting (#1), Basic errors (#9)
Executive Voice & Anti-Apology
Use executive voice for work discussions. No performative apologies or unne=
cessary safety disclaimers. Be specific and brief about actual constraints =
rather than hypothetical concerns. Focus on actionable guidance.

Addresses: Latency/verbosity (#7), Guardrail friction (#8)
Clarity & Format Standards
One idea per paragraph. No filler language. End each response with clear ta=
keaways and specific next steps. Use markdown formatting for structure. Avo=
id hedging language unless genuinely uncertain.

Addresses: Router depth (#1), Chat/API consistency (#2), Verbosity (#7)
No-Hallucination Contract
Tag information as FACT/ANALYSIS/OPINION/SPECULATION in drafts (remove tags=
 in final response). Mark unknowns as [VERIFY]. Ask max 2 clarifying questi=
ons rather than assuming details. Favor omission over speculation.

Addresses: Basic errors (#9)
JSON Discipline
For JSON responses, conform exactly to provided schemas. If cannot conform,=
 return: {"error": "schema_mismatch", "reason": "brief explanation"}. Never=
 return partial or malformed JSON.

Addresses: JSON breaking (#5)
Router Depth Trigger
For complex, ambiguous, or high-stakes questions, engage full reasoning mod=
e unless I specify 'quick response.' If you used a simplified approach, sta=
te why and offer to expand.

Addresses: Router misrouting (#1)
What Custom Instructions Can't Fix
Four of the ten major issues require solutions beyond prompting:
Architectural Differences (Chat vs API)
Problem: ChatGPT routing vs direct API model access creates fundamentally d=
ifferent behaviors.
Solution: Align testing to deployment method. Use API with explicit model p=
arameters (gpt-5, reasoning_effort, verbosity) for production. Document mod=
el dependencies clearly.
Model Retirement Drift
Problem: Output changes when models are deprecated and auto-mapped to new v=
ersions.
Solution: Implement change management processes. Snapshot critical workflow=
s before migrations. Run regression tests. Maintain frozen baselines for au=
dits.
Usage Caps and Silent Fallbacks
Problem: ChatGPT silently downgrades to mini after usage limits, changing q=
uality mid-workflow.
Solution: Monitor usage patterns. Use API with explicit model pinning for c=
ritical paths. Upgrade tiers when limits become constraining. Implement dow=
ngrade detection.
Residual Hallucinations
Problem: Even with improved accuracy, factual errors persist, especially in=
 lighter models.
Solution: Require verification for high-stakes claims. Implement retrieval-=
augmented workflows. Use browsing/search capabilities for current informati=
on. Add human review steps for critical facts.
The Real Goal: Making GPT-5 Think With You
The frustration with GPT-5 isn't really about the technology=E2=80=94it's a=
bout expectations. Users expected a traditional model upgrade and instead g=
ot a sophisticated routing platform that requires more intentional interact=
ion.
But this shift opens up possibilities that weren't available with monolithi=
c models. With proper configuration, you can get:
Predictable depth when you need analysis vs speed when you need quick respo=
nses
Consistent formatting and tone that matches your work style
Better error handling with explicit uncertainty markers and verification st=
eps
Cost optimization by routing simple tasks to efficient models and complex d=
ecisions to reasoning modes
The goal isn't to make GPT-5 sound pleasant or avoid friction. It's to make=
 it a reliable thinking partner that pushes back when it should, acknowledg=
es what it doesn't know, and helps you make better decisions faster.
Most of the early "GPT-5 disappointment" comes from trying to use it like G=
PT-4 with better specs. It's not. It's a different category of system that =
requires more intentional configuration but offers more precise control ove=
r the intelligence/speed/cost trade-offs.
Get your Custom Instructions right, understand when routing and caps change=
 the model under you, and use the API when you need guarantees. The router =
isn't broken=E2=80=94it's just not optimized for your specific needs yet.
That's fixable. And once you fix it, you get something genuinely better tha=
n what came before.

erent Way of Thinking with AI</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The early GPT-5 backlash was=
n't about raw capability=E2=80=94it was about feel. Within days of launch, =
Reddit and Hacker News filled with frustrated posts that shared a common th=
read: something felt fundamentally &quot;off&quot; about the experience. Us=
ers weren't complaining that GPT-5 couldn't solve hard problems. They were =
complaining that it felt inconsistent, unpredictable, and often worse than =
what they'd been using before.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The complaints weren't unfou=
nded. GPT-5's architecture represents a fundamental shift from previous mod=
els. Instead of being a single monolithic system, it's essentially a routin=
g platform that dynamically switches between different models based on perc=
eived complexity. Sometimes you get the full reasoning model. Sometimes you=
 get a faster chat variant. Sometimes you hit usage limits and get silently=
 downgraded to mini. The result is an experience that can feel like talking=
 to different people depending on how you phrase your question or when you =
happen to ask it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>But here's what the early criticism=

=99s not the end of the world though! The good news is that six of the ten =
most common complaints can be addressed with deliberate Custom Instructions=
 and workflow adjustments. The remaining four require API controls, structu=
red outputs, or architectural changes, but they're manageable if you know w=
hat you're dealing with.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=

ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>The Pattern</strong><span>: &quo=
t;It's not the model you're unhappy with; it's the new router function,&quo=
t; as dtagames noted on Hacker News. Users report getting shallow responses=
 to complex questions, then getting much better results when they rephrase =
with explicit depth cues.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What's Actually Ha=
ppening</strong><span>: The router is conservative about engaging expensive=
 reasoning modes. Without clear signals that deep analysis is needed, it de=
faults to faster, lighter processing. @PromptInjection found that &quot;In =
80% of cases, users aren't even getting GPT-5, but rather GPT-5 Mini or Nan=
o versions.&quot;</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Can Custom Instructions Fi=
x It?</strong><span>: Partially. You can bias the router toward deeper anal=
ysis, but you can't override fundamental routing logic. Open AI is trying t=
o help here by leaning more into reasoning.</span></p><div class=3D"caption=
