Like seriously the hype is going to be nuts this week.
Like I don=E2=80=99t know exactly what this means but cool cool, great job =
Satya. I am listening. If there was a budget for hype slides it would be bl=
own out this week. Everybody who is anybody is making sure they get the wor=
d out specifically for developers this week on AI.=20
And yes, there=E2=80=99s a specific reason for that, and it all starts back=
 in 1983=E2=80=A6
I am only KIND OF kidding about that btw. These kinds of events have a trem=
endous calendar gravity that is very interesting to study on its own, even =
leaving aside all the cool AI stuff. Which we will not do because this is a=
n AI substack lol
So read on for the full deets on the absolutely bonkers week from nearly al=
l the major model makers, including what to watch for and the questions to =
ask to read under the hype cycle.
Subscribers get all these posts!
How we got to a nice May week for all this stuff=E2=80=A6
So this really did start in 1983, when Apple did the first WWDC. We won=E2=
=80=99t belabor the entire history of WWDC, which is probably an entire boo=
k on its own. Suffice to say that because Apple has slotted WWDC in the fir=
st week of June in SF (for the weather) for ages, major companies had to pi=
ck another nice weather week nearby in the SF calendar for their own events=
=2E
Major companies such as=E2=80=A6Google. Which has been doing Google I/O on =
this week in May since Sundar started leading Google. And it makes sense to=
 go ahead of Apple, because he who goes first gets to frame the debate. Whi=
ch is exactly why OpenAI put their Codex release on Friday last week. They =
wanted to pre-frame the week (or pre-game if you will). So everyone who rel=
eases this week has to be compared to Codex in the inevitable journo writeu=
ps, and they get lots of free press.
Well historically Google wanted the exact same thing vs. Apple when Google =
vs. Apple was about Android vs. iPhone. Now these days, Apple has been an a=
lso-ran on AI for a bit now, and so Google I/O has become less important fo=
r Android per se and more important for the AI game.=20
Which is why all the other model makers decided to crowd onto this week to =
get their word in edgewise. Microsoft wants something this week. Anthropic,=
 ditto. AWS is settling for hosting a watch party because they have their o=
wn massive conference even earlier in the deal cycle.=20
And deal cycle is a key word here, because if you go later than June, you r=
un into earnings calls, and you fall afoul of enterprise budgets for the FY=
2026 year, which are set in the middle of 2025. So as weird as it seems, th=
is week is sort of the last change these big players have to catch major en=
terprise attention before 2026 budgets get locked=E2=80=A6

Already dropped last week
May 14: OpenAI rolled GPT-4.1 and 4.1 mini into ChatGPT (plus API pricing c=
uts).
May 16: OpenAI previewed a Codex autonomous coding agent that spins up sand=
-box VMs and opens PRs.
Deeper Analysis: What Super-Week Really Signals
1. The operating-system grab
Microsoft just turned Windows into an AI launchpad. By baking the Model Con=
text Protocol (MCP) into the 24H2 developer preview, Windows now treats any=
 compliant agent the way it treats a printer driver: plug in, request a sco=
ped capability, run. Consent pop-ups and a curated MCP registry make the se=
curity story tangible, not theoretical. That shifts the distribution game=
=E2=80=94a Windows installer becomes an agent installer, and Microsoft owns=
 the default runway for local + cloud workflows.
Google must answer immediately or cede terrain. I/O leaks point to =E2=80=
=9CProject Astra,=E2=80=9D a Gemini-driven task graph that lets Android app=
s hand structured jobs to Gemini across Gmail, Calendar, and Maps. If that =
graph launches as a closed API, Google keeps tight control but risks repeat=
ing the =E2=80=9CAssistant versus Alexa=E2=80=9D stalemate; if it=E2=80=99s=
 open, the protocol war gets interesting.
Anthropic=E2=80=99s Thursday keynote is smaller but pointed: it promises an=
 open-source MCP reference SDK that shows Claude requesting and validating =
scopes step-by-step. If that code drops as advertised, Anthropic positions =
itself as the neutral glue that can speak both Microsoft=E2=80=99s and Goog=
le=E2=80=99s dialects=E2=80=94insurance for developers wary of vendor lock-=
in.
2. Protocols are leverage; demos are garnish
Build=E2=80=99s fashion-show of Copilot features matters less than the unde=
rlying handshake rules. Once a user grants an MCP token, every tool that re=
spects that standard can ride along without re-prompting. That is exactly h=
ow Microsoft captured enterprise identity with Active Directory two decades=
 ago. Google will try to lace the same dynamic into Android 16; watch wheth=
er third-party devs can embed Gemini tasks without begging for blanket Driv=
e or Location access.
3. Economics are being rewritten in real time
OpenAI=E2=80=99s surprise GPT-4.1 mini cut input costs to roughly $0.80 per=
 million tokens=E2=80=94less than a third of Claude Sonnet=E2=80=99s curren=
t rate. If Google undercuts that with a new Gemini tier (it almost certainl=
y will), or Anthropic unveils a cheaper =E2=80=9CClaude 3.8 mini=E2=80=9D o=
r similar, every product running summarization, coding, or retrieval at sca=
le will have to rerun its margin math by Friday afternoon. The first vendor=
 to combine a low price with a permissive protocol will set the floor for e=
veryone else.
4. The hidden constraint: silicon
Every grand vision still lives or dies on GPU allocations. Nadella name-dro=
pped GB200 clusters and flagged Windows AI Foundry as =E2=80=9Clocal-model =
ready=E2=80=9D because Microsoft has lined up supply from AMD, Intel, Nvidi=
a, and Qualcomm. Nadella keeps leaning on his cloud buying chops as a way o=
f signaling he can actually serve models at scale. Jensen (who also gave a =
big speech this week) is no doubt happy headed into earnings May 28. If Goo=
gle and Anthropic don=E2=80=99t flash comparable numbers=E2=80=94or announc=
e fixed-price reserved compute=E2=80=94expect wait-lists and throttling to =
linger. Remember: protocols without hardware are traffic laws without roads=
, and where you gonna drive? This isn=E2=80=99t James Bond.
6. Strategic synthesis
This week is not just a series of launches; it=E2=80=99s a referendum on wh=
o will own the agent runtime layer for the next decade. Microsoft is bettin=
g on an open standard embedded in the dominant desktop OS. Google believes =
ambient mobile intelligence plus cross-app reach can keep Android at the ce=
nter. Anthropic wants to be the Switzerland that speaks every dialect and s=
ells trust. OpenAI, by dropping cheaper models ahead of the conference rush=
, is trying to make every keynote feel like a response to its pricing curve=
 and model intelligence (Codex). Watch how these threads converge: the winn=
er will probably be the company that marries an open (or at least developer=
-friendly) protocol with a cost profile that makes large-scale agent use ec=
onomical.
That lens=E2=80=94protocol leverage, real cost, governance credibility, and=
 hardware reality=E2=80=94will keep you anchored when the demo fog rolls in=
=2E
Five high-altitude questions to keep on your notepad during Super-Week
Where did a vendor turn optional usage into a new default?
 When Microsoft bakes Model Context Protocol into Windows or Google folds G=
emini straight into Android system services, they=E2=80=99re not just rolli=
ng out features=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re changing what happens automatically=
=2E Ask which announcement, if widely a=
dopted, rewrites user behavior without=
 further friction. Default status is the ultimate moat.
What proprietary feedback loop did today=E2=80=99s launch unlock?
 A slick demo matters less than the steady stream of user data, domain cont=
ext, or tool-usage telemetry it generates. Identify whose new agent, SDK, o=
r cloud tie-in will pour the most valuable data back into its creator=E2=80=
=99s training pipeline. Feedback loops, not one-time launches, determine co=
mpounding advantage.
Which stubborn bottleneck is each keynote really attacking=E2=80=94and is t=
he attack coherent?
 Strip away the showmanship and name the single constraint a company is try=
ing to smash (distribution, safety trust, mobile context fragmentation, GPU=
 scarcity). Then test whether every major element of the keynote reinforces=
 that aim or drifts into grab-bag territory. Coherence signals durable stra=
tegy; scattershot signals opportunism.
What newly possible weekend hack now threatens an incumbent line of busines=
s?
 Pricing drops and open protocols don=E2=80=99t just trim costs=E2=80=94the=
y lower the barrier for two smart people in a coffee shop to build somethin=
g that used to require a team and a Series A. Note the first =E2=80=9Caha=
=E2=80=9D idea that pops into your head when you hear a model price or SDK =
availability; that=E2=80=99s exactly where a disruptive startup will appear=
=2E
Which price or capacity threshold quietly flipped the strategic scoreboard?
 A token price falling below your current cost to serve, or a public guaran=
tee of Blackwell-class GPU capacity, is more than a footnote=E2=80=94it can=
 invalidate existing plans overnight. Mark any slide that moves a hard numb=
er (cost, latency, context size, reserved compute) past a line that once fe=
lt safe. Those threshold moments are where strong strategies pivot fast.
Don=E2=80=99t count your chickens until the end of the week
AI Super-Week isn=E2=80=99t just a calendar oddity; it=E2=80=99s the moment=
 the platforms wars come out in the open. Microsoft grabbed for distributio=
n by wiring MCP into Windows. Google will likely double down on mobile cont=
ext with Gemini-everywhere and flash some headset stuff to take a shot at M=
eta. Anthropic will try to make trust and neutrality the killer feature, pl=
us hint at more intelligence on the near-term roadmap (they will have some =
juice stuff for indie devs to play with right away). OpenAI will sit back a=
nd watch everyone get compared to them all week.
Just keep in mind: defaults, feedback loops, bottlenecks, weekend-hack oppo=
rtunities, and threshold flips. That=E2=80=99s the shorthand for the week.
Defaults tell you where users will drift without thinking.
Feedback loops reveal who will compound fastest.
Bottlenecks show which bets are grounded in real constraint-breaking.
Weekend hacks foreshadow the startups incumbents will soon pretend to ignor=
e.
Threshold flips warn you when yesterday=E2=80=99s safe assumptions just exp=
ired.
Spend some time on Friday answering those five questions in plain English. =
Anything that lights up across the board is worth paying attention to as pa=
rt of your roadmap or investment thesis.=20
I=E2=80=99ll be keeping an eye on things through the week and bringing some=
 perspective here too. Get out the popcorn and have fun!

=E2=80=A6</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So this really did start in 1983, when Apple did=
 the first WWDC. We won=E2=80=99t belabor the entire history of WWDC, which=
 is probably an entire book on its own. Suffice to say that because Apple h=
as slotted WWDC in the first week of June in SF (for the weather) for ages,=
 major companies had to pick another nice weather week nearby in the SF cal=
endar for their own events.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>Major companies such as=
=E2=80=A6Google. Which has been doing Google I/O on this week in May since =
Sundar started leading Google. And it makes sense to go ahead of Apple, bec=
ause </span><em>he who goes first gets to frame the debate</em><span>. Whic=
h is </span><em>exactly why</em><span> OpenAI put their Codex release on Fr=
iday last week. They wanted to pre-frame the week (or pre-game if you will)=
. So everyone who releases this week has to be compared to Codex in the ine=
vitable journo writeups, and they get lots of free press.</span></p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">Well historically Google wanted the exact same thing vs. Apple when G=
oogle vs. Apple was about Android vs. iPhone. Now these days, Apple has bee=
n an also-ran on AI for a bit now, and so Google I/O has become less import=
ant for Android per se and more important for the AI game. </p><p style=3D"=
margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
><span>Which is why all the </span><em>other</em><span> model makers decide=
d to crowd onto this week to get their word in edgewise. Microsoft wants so=
mething this week. Anthropic, ditto. AWS is settling for hosting a watch pa=
rty because they have their </span><em>own</em><span> massive conference ev=
en earlier in the deal cycle. </span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And deal cycle is a k=
ey word here, because if you go later than June, you run into earnings call=
s, and you fall afoul of enterprise budgets for the FY2026 year, which are =
set in the middle of 2025. So as weird as it seems, this week is sort of th=
e last change these big players have to catch major enterprise attention be=
fore 2026 budgets get locked=E2=80=A6</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" s=
