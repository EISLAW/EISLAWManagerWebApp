July 22=2C 2025

Question: Do you think either of these are likely to happen?
1. Russia will have in the future a paradigm shift that brings it closer t=
o the West and that Ukraine will precipitate the shift.
2. Unless there is a coup in Russia=2C which is unlikely=2C Putin will kee=
p the Ukrainian territory that he=E2=80=99s taken and someone else will fi=
nish the job.

Response:
I do not see Putin=E2=80=99s being forced from office as an improbable eve=
nt. It is true that Putin is a dictator=2C but dictators fall=2C and he is=
 far from having the power of Stalin or even Khrushchev. One reason is tha=
t he does not have the infrastructure of communism=2C which was highly eff=
ective. Stalin had the Communist Party=2C which was a segment of society.=
 The benefit of party membership was economically and socially substantial=
=2E Party members present in all areas of Russian life were expected to repo=
rt those with anti-party or anti-Stalin views. They benefited from their p=
osition and saturated society=2C sometimes being in the party in secret. T=
he fact that this was known to be the case by the Russian public limited d=
issent greatly=2C as execution or the gulag could be the outcome. The Comm=
unist Party is gone=2C and while I am sure that there are still informers=
 about=2C the highly effective and efficient infrastructure of oppression=
 is gone. Therefore=2C the ability to detect dissent in the public is
dramatically reduced.

At the same time=2C many have lost family in the war against Ukraine=2C an=
d much of the Russian economy is in shambles. Putin does not have the infr=
astructure that the communists had=2C so=2C for example=2C there was in re=
cent years significant unrest in Siberia. Moreover=2C as a dictator=2C he=
 has people all around him who are sufficiently afraid of him to place him=
 in danger. This is an odd thing to say=2C but dictators who frighten clos=
e supporters=2C without the kind of intelligence the Communist Party could=
 generate=2C make themselves vulnerable. The cost of the war in Ukraine is=
 high. A coup has already been staged and failed by the Wagner Group=2C th=
e leaders of which died in a tragic plane crash. So=2C while Putin certain=
ly intimidates people=2C one of the dangers of dictators is that those who=
 think they are suspected have nothing to lose.

Putin=E2=80=99s failures in the military dimension and in the economy rais=
e questions about the future. I think he is concerned as well and is despe=
rately trying to turn the war in Ukraine around to diminish the sense of f=
ailure he has generated. This is far from a forecast=2C but dictators who=
 fail and do not have the capabilities of a Stalin are vulnerable. Mussoli=
ni was a dictator who failed in a war=2C and the Italians hanged him. Agai=
n=2C far from a forecast. Just a possibility. I do not understand the stru=
cture of the top tier of the Russian political system=2C but when dictator=
s fall it is due to a mass rising or an internal coup. I am not predicting=
 either=2C but neither is it obvious to me that Putin=E2=80=99s power is a=
bsolute and unchallengeable.

Question: What role might China play in the Russian dynamic? China has lar=
ge commercial links with Russia=2C and Beijing would be a main target of T=
rump=E2=80=99s secondary sanctions. Would/can China protect Putin from Tru=
mp?

Response:

China and Russia were antagonistic for much of the Cold War=2C particularl=
y during the post-Stalin period. At the time the U.S. and China were begin=
ning to consider opening talks=2C the Russians attacked China on the Ussur=
i River=2C one of several firefights. When the Ukraine war started and the=
 U.N. voted on condemning Russia=2C China did not vote with Russia=2C but=
 abstained. Also now in China there is increasing talk=2C as there was und=
er Mao=2C about the land that is now Russia=E2=80=99s Far East that was se=
ized from China. There are maps commonly available in China that show this=
 territory=2C including Vladivostok=2C as part of China. China has little=
 to gain or fear from Russia and many bad memories. China is far more inte=
rested in stabilizing economic relations with the United States=2C its maj=
or market=2C than in collaborating with Russia and increasing tensions wit=
h the United States.

Remember that exports to the U.S. and investments by American firms in Chi=
na were a vital element of China=E2=80=99s emergence as an economic power.=
 So I don=E2=80=99t see a strong relationship between China and Russia or=
 any interest for China in supporting Russia.

Comment/Question: You wrote an article in 2019=2C "Pearl Harbor and the St=
rategy of Economic Sanctions=2C" about how economic sanctions=2C while nor=
mally intended to influence a state's behavior while avoiding military con=
flict=2C can inadvertently force their hand to use military force in unexp=
ected ways.

Do you think Russia would ever use preemptive military action against NATO=
 in response to U.S./EU sanctions? Baked into this question are certain as=
sumptions=2C namely that sanctions are effective enough to drive Russia to=
 this point and that Russia has the capabilities to strike while also bogg=
ed down in Ukraine.

Response:

The United States placed Japan in a very difficult position before the att=
ack on Pearl Harbor. Japan is country with few national resources. Before=
 World War II=2C it imported its oil from what is now Indonesia and its st=
eel from the United States. After Japan invaded China in its search for ra=
w materials=2C Roosevelt had the U.S. buy up the oil that the Japanese wer=
e getting from Indonesia and cut off sales of metal to Japan. This placed=
 Japan in a very precarious position. The attack on Pearl Harbor in Decemb=
er 1941 was intended to force the United States to the negotiating table.=
 The United States in 1941 was far from a militarily significant country=
=2C and it was recovering slowly from the depression. So the Japanese atta=
cked a seemingly weak America with an expectation of negotiations=2C not f=
ull-scale war. In the case of Russia=2C there is no way to miscalculate on=
 American military power=2C nor on the American response to an attack. Jap=
an could underestimate U.S. military power. Russia cannot.
So while economic issues can lead to war=2C the danger of that strategy is=
 the military response that is possible. I do not think a Russian attack o=
n the U.S. or NATO is in the cards.

Other Questions

Question: Do you think that immigration is also a risk to the U.S. if we a=
re bringing in too many people who don=E2=80=99t share the same religious=
 or cultural norms that our country was founded on? Some European countrie=
s are struggling with this problem to the point where it=E2=80=99s been sa=
id that in a couple of countries=2C 60 percent of their population now con=
stitute religions and cultural beliefs different from their own. Whether t=
his was by design or by accident=2C shouldn=E2=80=99t we as a country be c=
oncerned with this trend?

Response:

Benjamin Franklin wrote a pamphlet on the danger of German immigrants to t=
he United States=2C saying they are a swarthy people incapable of becoming=
 Americans. When the Scotch Irish migration to the United States occurred=
 in the early 18^th century=2C they were widely regarded as a drunken hord=
e and a danger to America. When the Irish and Italians surged into the Uni=
ted States in the late 19^th century=2C they were despised for being Catho=
lics and deemed incompatible with American culture. And so on. Americans a=
lways despise the new immigrant when they come en masse=2C without realizi=
ng that they came here because they had little in their own country and th=
at=2C while the first generation would keep their old customs=2C the secon=
d generation would gladly assimilate. The cultural norm of the United Stat=
es is that it is so dynamic it always needs menial labor=2C and those who=
 immigrate here are first despised. In other words=2C American culture is=
 based on immigration=2C with the fear of immigrants deep and
the need for immigrants for the workforce overwhelming. Every major migrat=
ion to the United States started with fear and contempt of the immigrants=
=2C enriched by the flow of menial laborers. So too with the last wave of=
 Mexican immigrants. (Note: I have excluded Jews from this tale because ev=
eryone was delighted to see us.)

The United States was an invented country=2C both its constitution and its=
 population=2C which were all immigrants and all changing and evolving the=
 norm. The process of immigration that engineered the population was mecha=
nistic. First=2C contempt and loathing=2C followed by future generations b=
oth integrating with and changing the American culture. European nations a=
re very different. They have historically based and to some extent static=
 cultures. European countries were not invented nor reengineered. So they=
 have far more rigidity in their cultures=2C and therefore more difficulty=
 integrating immigrants than the United States has. In a sense their cultu=
re is static=2C the American dynamic.

<br>
<strong>Response: </strong></p>

<div>I do not see Putin=E2=80=99s being forced from office as an improbable=
 event. It is true that Putin is a dictator, but dictators fall, and he is =
far from having the power of Stalin or even Khrushchev. One reason is that =
he does not have the infrastructure of communism, which was highly effectiv=
e. Stalin had the Communist Party, which was a segment of society. The bene=
fit of party membership was economically and socially substantial. Party me=
mbers present in all areas of Russian life were expected to report those wi=
th anti-party or anti-Stalin views. They benefited from their position and =
saturated society, sometimes being in the party in secret. The fact that th=
is was known to be the case by the Russian public limited dissent greatly, =
as execution or the gulag could be the outcome. The Communist Party is gone=
, and while I am sure that there are still informers about, the highly effe=
ctive and efficient infrastructure of oppression is gone. Therefore, the ab=
ility to detect dissent in the public is dramatically reduced.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At the same time, many have lost family in the war against Ukraine, and muc=
h of the Russian economy is in shambles. Putin does not have the infrastruc=
ture that the communists had, so, for example, there was in recent years si=
gnificant unrest in Siberia. Moreover, as a dictator, he has people all aro=
und him who are sufficiently afraid of him to place him in danger. This is =
an odd thing to say, but dictators who frighten close supporters, without t=
he kind of intelligence the Communist Party could generate, make themselves=
 vulnerable. The cost of the war in Ukraine is high. A coup has already bee=
n staged and failed by the Wagner Group, the leaders of which died in a tra=
gic plane crash. So, while Putin certainly intimidates people, one of the d=
angers of dictators is that those who think they are suspected have nothing=
 to lose.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Putin=E2=80=99s failures in the military dimension and in the economy raise=
 questions about the future. I think he is concerned as well and is despera=
tely trying to turn the war in Ukraine around to diminish the sense of fail=
ure he has generated. This is far from a forecast, but dictators who fail a=
nd do not have the capabilities of a Stalin are vulnerable. Mussolini was a=
 dictator who failed in a war, and the Italians hanged him. Again, far from=
 a forecast. Just a possibility. I do not understand the structure of the t=
op tier of the Russian political system, but when dictators fall it is due =
to a mass rising or an internal coup. I am not predicting either, but neith=
er is it obvious to me that Putin=E2=80=99s power is absolute and unchallen=
geable.</div>

<strong>Response:</strong><br>
<br>
China and Russia were antagonistic for much of the Cold War, particularly d=
uring the post-Stalin period. At the time the U.S. and China were beginning=
 to consider opening talks, the Russians attacked China on the Ussuri River=
, one of several firefights. When the Ukraine war started and the U.N. vote=
d on condemning Russia, China did not vote with Russia, but abstained. Also=
 now in China there is increasing talk, as there was under Mao, about the l=
and that is now Russia=E2=80=99s Far East that was seized from China. There=
 are maps commonly available in China that show this territory, including V=
ladivostok, as part of China. China has little to gain or fear from Russia =
and many bad memories. China is far more interested in stabilizing economic=
 relations with the United States, its major market, than in collaborating =
with Russia and increasing tensions with the United States.<br>
<br>
Remember that exports to the U.S. and investments by American firms in Chin=
a were a vital element of China=E2=80=99s emergence as an economic power. S=
o I don=E2=80=99t see a strong relationship between China and Russia or any=
 interest for China in supporting Russia.</p>

<strong>Response:</strong><br>
<br>
The United States placed Japan in a very difficult position before the atta=
ck on Pearl Harbor. Japan is country with few national resources. Before Wo=
rld War II, it imported its oil from what is now Indonesia and its steel fr=
om the United States. After Japan invaded China in its search for raw mater=
ials, Roosevelt had the U.S. buy up the oil that the Japanese were getting =
from Indonesia and cut off sales of metal to Japan. This placed Japan in a =
very precarious position. The attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 was i=
ntended to force the United States to the negotiating table. The United Sta=
tes in 1941 was far from a militarily significant country, and it was recov=
ering slowly from the depression. So the Japanese attacked a seemingly weak=
 America with an expectation of negotiations, not full-scale war. In the ca=
se of Russia, there is no way to miscalculate on American military power, n=
or on the American response to an attack. Japan could underestimate U.S. mi=
litary power. Russia cannot. So while economic issues can lead to war, the =
danger of that strategy is the military response that is possible. I do not=
 think a Russian attack on the U.S. or NATO is in the cards.</p>

<strong>Response:</strong><br>
<br>
Benjamin Franklin wrote a pamphlet on the danger of German immigrants to th=
e United States, saying they are a swarthy people incapable of becoming Ame=
ricans. When the Scotch Irish migration to the United States occurred in th=
e early 18<sup>th</sup> century, they were widely regarded as a drunken hor=
de and a danger to America. When the Irish and Italians surged into the Uni=
ted States in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, they were despised for bein=
g Catholics and deemed incompatible with American culture. And so on. Ameri=
cans always despise the new immigrant when they come en masse, without real=
izing that they came here because they had little in their own country and =
that, while the first generation would keep their old customs, the second g=
eneration would gladly assimilate. The cultural norm of the United States i=
s that it is so dynamic it always needs menial labor, and those who immigra=
te here are first despised. In other words, American culture is based on im=
migration, with the fear of immigrants deep and the need for immigrants for=
 the workforce overwhelming. Every major migration to the United States sta=
rted with fear and contempt of the immigrants, enriched by the flow of meni=
al laborers. So too with the last wave of Mexican immigrants. (Note: I have=
 excluded Jews from this tale because everyone was delighted to see us.)<br=
>
&nbsp;<br>
The United States was an invented country, both its constitution and its po=
pulation, which were all immigrants and all changing and evolving the norm.=
 The process of immigration that engineered the population was mechanistic.=
 First, contempt and loathing, followed by future generations both integrat=
ing with and changing the American culture. European nations are very diffe=
rent. They have historically based and to some extent static cultures. Euro=
pean countries were not invented nor reengineered. So they have far more ri=
gidity in their cultures, and therefore more difficulty integrating immigra=
nts than the United States has. In a sense their culture is static, the Ame=
rican dynamic.<br>
