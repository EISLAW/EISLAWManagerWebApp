TRADE DEALS PUT THE SCREWS TO RUSSIA [3]
BUT OVERLOOKED IN THE RECENT TARIFF AGREEMENTS IS THE CHINA FACTOR.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
The United States and the European Union announced a new trade framework on July 27, marking a significant development in trans-Atlantic relations. The deal came just five days after the U.S. and
Japan reached a similar one. Separately, on July 28, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would move up its 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine to just 10-12 days.
Trump warned that failure to reach a deal within this new timeframe could lead to severe sanctions, including secondary tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Russia.
These developments show that the U.S. has no intention of decelerating its efforts to realign the global order. Relations with China will suffer as a result, especially if Beijing sees these moves for
what they are: a concerted effort to assert Western dominance of – and thus curb Beijing’s influence in – global affairs.
THE FINE PRINT
There is limited official information available on the U.S.-EU framework; no formal document has been released for review yet. However, the details shared during the press conference suggest a new
trans-Atlantic understanding. Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a 15 percent tariff on most imports from the EU – half the 30 percent rate Trump had previously threatened – in exchange for
European concessions.
The concessions include a commitment to invest around $600 billion in the U.S. economy, with a focus on the infrastructure and technology sectors. The EU has also agreed to purchase $750 billion worth
of U.S. energy, including oil and natural gas, over the next three or so years – an overt play to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy. Moreover, the EU has agreed to purchase unspecified
amounts of U.S. military equipment. The existing 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum will remain in place, though they will transition to a quota system to ease their impact.
The agreement will likely help avert a full-scale trade war: Trump's planned tariff increase to 30 percent on all EU goods on Aug. 1 was canceled, as was the EU's planned retaliation on 93 billion
euros ($107 billion) of U.S. exports. The deal establishes zero tariffs on specific goods, including aircraft and their components, certain chemicals, generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some
agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials. Though the official framework is still unclear, these provisions suggest a desire to deepen trans-Atlantic technological
interdependence, especially with regard to dual-use goods and critical infrastructure.
The framework mirrors key parts of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement that was reached just a few days earlier, in which Japan agreed to similar terms, reportedly accepting U.S. tariffs on the order of 15
percent to avert 30 percent tariffs at a later date. European negotiators surely looked to this agreement as a playbook. German officials, for example, made sure Europe’s auto industry would get the
same access to the U.S. market as Japan’s did under Tokyo’s deal. In the end, cars and auto parts from the EU will face the same baseline 15 percent tariff that Japan’s do. (This was a relief
for German carmakers who had feared being disadvantaged if Japan secured better terms.)
Importantly, the agreements suggest Europe and Japan were aligned in resisting U.S. protectionism: neither wanted the other to undercut them in the U.S. market. In a broader sense, the fact that the
EU and Japan struck similar tariff-reducing deals with Washington may encourage closer coordination between Europe and Japan. Both economies have championed free trade and multilateral rules in recent
years, and both found themselves pressured by Trump’s aggressive bilateral tactics. Having made similar compromises with the U.S., Europe and Japan now have even more reason to present a united
front on trade issues. Analysts suggest this trend could lead to deeper G7 economic integration. All G7 members – with the exception of Canada, which is already party to the USMCA – have now
hashed out trade agreements with the Trump administration. The large commitments by Japan and the EU to invest in the U.S. and buy American products will also increase trilateral interdependence.
Meanwhile, EU-Japan bilateral ties – anchored by a free trade agreement initially agreed to in 2018 and that entered into force in 2025 as a strategic partnership agreement [4] – remain strong.
That pact continues to eliminate nearly all tariffs between Europe and Japan, a provision made more valuable by the fact that as U.S. tariffs raise the cost of European and Japanese goods in the
United States, Europe and Japan may bolster trade with each other to offset any losses.
In short, the July 27 deal puts the EU and Japan on a similar footing with regard to U.S. trade policy, and in doing so, it will likely strengthen their trade relations. They share a common experience
of weathering Trump’s pressure and will probably collaborate closely to uphold a rules-based trade order and ensure that the new U.S. tariff regimes do not unfairly disadvantage their industries.
THE CHINA AND RUSSIA EFFECT
Hovering over all of this is the fact that the trans-Atlantic deal will intensify Europe’s strategic tilt toward the U.S. and away from China. In recent years, the EU’s relationship with China has
been complex – a mix of deep trade ties and growing unease about Beijing’s policies. From China’s perspective, the new U.S.-EU trade framework may push Europe further into the American camp on
trade and technology issues, even as U.S.-China tensions escalate. Notably, China has been locked in a trade dispute with the U.S. all year. Earlier this year, Beijing responded to U.S. tariff hikes
with its own punitive tariffs – reportedly raising duties on American goods to as high as 125 percent – in a show of defiance. Some in Europe initially hoped to stay out of the trade war, but the
July 27 deal means that is no longer possible (if it ever was). By agreeing to buy massive quantities of U.S. liquified natural gas, oil and other exports while investing in trans-Atlantic
infrastructure, the EU is implicitly reducing its reliance on other suppliers that compete with the U.S. and taking similar protectionist measures. Whatever Europe’s relationship with China before
July 27, the current deal could have Europe join U.S. efforts to diversify away from Chinese supply chains for strategically sensitive goods.
By extracting concessions from both Japan and Europe, Washington has strengthened its position in the broader competition with China. In the past, Chinese leaders have urged Europe to maintain
“strategic autonomy” rather than side with Washington, but this new deal suggests Europe felt compelled to accommodate U.S. demands. Beijing might try to exploit European discontent over the deal
by offering closer trade ties with China as an alternative. However, any such outreach will be complicated by China’s own disputes with the EU (over issues like human rights and technology transfer)
and by China’s alignment with Russia in the Ukraine war, which Europe strongly opposes.
In fact, China’s support for Russia is one area where new trans-Atlantic solidarity could clash directly with Beijing. Along with the U.S., Europe has tried to discourage China from helping Russia
evade sanctions or from supporting the war effort militarily. Now that Europe and the U.S. economically aligned, the Western alliance against Russia – and, by extension, against Chinese assistance
to Russia – is strengthened. Overall, Europe’s decision to prioritize a trade truce with Washington sends a signal that trans-Atlantic unity comes before ties with Beijing. Going forward, the EU
may coordinate more closely with the U.S. in confronting China on trade practices, export controls and investment screening, especially as China doubles down on its partnership with Moscow to counter
Western solidarity.
It’s unsurprising, then, that just hours after the July 27 deal was announced, the Trump administration set a new deadline for Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. Earlier in July, Trump gave Russian
President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum: Agree to peace in 50 days or face stiff penalties. But on July 28, apparently frustrated by continued Russian aggression, Trump shortened the deadline to just
10-12 days, insisting there was no reason to wait any longer. He made it clear that if Moscow did not comply by the new deadline, the U.S. would impose secondary sanctions, beginning with 100 percent
tariffs on any country that continued to trade with Russia.
This is an unprecedented escalation – effectively a form of secondary sanction aimed at Russia’s top trade partners, notably China and India, as well as others such as Brazil and Turkey. NATO
Secretary-General Mark Rutte met with Trump in mid-July to coordinate on the strategy. The goal is to pressure these countries to stop supporting Russia’s war effort.
For China, which is Russia’s largest trade partner and a key buyer of its oil, gas and commodities, Trump’s ultimatum creates a strategic dilemma. If implemented, 100 percent secondary tariffs
would be devastating [5] – essentially pricing Chinese goods out of the U.S. market or otherwise sanctioning Chinese firms and banks involved with Russia.
Beijing has responded with defiance. Rather than distance himself from Moscow, President Xi Jinping pledged to “deepen China’s support for Russia.” During a meeting with Russia’s foreign
minister, Xi emphasized the need to implement recent bilateral agreements and called for closer cooperation on global issues. He advocated a united effort between Beijing and Moscow to rally the
Global South against Western pressure and promote a more multipolar world order. This was a clear public reaffirmation of the China-Russia partnership, even in the face of potential U.S. sanctions.
Chinese state media reported that Xi and Putin agreed to jointly protect their development and security interests while working to reform the international order in a fairer direction – a subtle
reference to resisting U.S.-led sanctions and dominance.
If China follows through on its stance, it will probably shield its trade with Russia as much as possible, consequences be damned. China may increase its use of yuan currency settlements and
alternative payment systems to continue trading with Russia while avoiding U.S. financial channels. Already, China has provided an economic lifeline to Moscow by purchasing record amounts of Russian
oil, often at a discount, and supplying various goods. However, these trade flows could be threatened if Western shipping, insurance companies or Chinese firms become wary of potential U.S. penalties.
Otherwise, Beijing may try to determine whether it should weather the storm or retaliate in kind. China is happy to escalate tensions, as it did earlier this year, retaliating against U.S. duties by
imposing its own tariff hikes – some as high as 125 percent – on American imports. If Trump imposes 100 percent tariffs on countries that trade with Russia, China could respond by implementing
similarly harsh tariffs on U.S. goods or by restricting exports of critical materials that are essential to U.S. industries. This would effectively trigger a trade war beyond the scale of any in the
first Trump administration. The global economic fallout would be significant, but Beijing may be willing to endure some pain to demonstrate its resolve.
Crucially, secondary sanctions would challenge China’s energy security. China receives more than 15 percent of its oil imports and a significant portion of its piped gas from Russia. China would
need to quickly seek alternative sources if they were cut, likely from the Middle East or Africa, and likely at higher spot prices. But if Beijing continues purchasing Russian oil in defiance of
sanctions, insurers and shipping companies might pull out of China altogether to avoid U.S. penalties. To prevent that from happening, China may resort to using its own shadow fleet of sanctioned
tankers, or expand its overland pipeline capacity to keep Russian energy coming in. Either way, procurement costs would increase. The mere threat of sanctions has already made Chinese banks and
businesses more cautious in dealing with Russia.
But Beijing has made it clear that it does not support Western sanctions on Russia and has no intention of seeing Russia weakened by them. Xi and Putin have already declared a “no limits”
partnership, and they pledged to “decisively oppose U.S. hegemony” together. Even so, there may be limits to Beijing’s actions. The EU is a major export destination for China, comparable to the
U.S., and Japan is a top trade partner. If the U.S., the EU and Japan continue to align under a framework trade deal, as they appear to be doing, China will be forced to decide whether it can bear the
consequences of losing its top export markets, particularly at a time when its internal economic stability remains fragile [6].
By threatening to apply sanctions on Russia and its allies so soon after forging trade agreements, the U.S. is trying to manufacture a new order with itself still at the center. For this strategy to
work, there must be a belief that the Trump administration will honor its threats. Washington has balked before, and its competitors likely hope it will do so again.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The United States =
and the European Union announced a new trade framework on July 27, marking =
a significant development in trans-Atlantic relations. The deal came just f=
ive days after the U.S. and Japan reached a similar one. Separately, on Jul=
y 28, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would move up its 50-d=
ay deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine to just 10-12 day=
s. Trump warned that failure to reach a deal within this new timeframe coul=
d lead to severe sanctions, including secondary tariffs on countries that c=
ontinue to trade with Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These developments=
 show that the U.S. has no intention of decelerating its efforts to realign=
 the global order. Relations with China will suffer as a result, especially=
 if Beijing sees these moves for what they are: a concerted effort to asser=
t Western dominance of =E2=80=93 and thus curb Beijing=E2=80=99s influence =
in =E2=80=93 global affairs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The Fine P=
rint</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There is limited o=
fficial information available on the U.S.-EU framework; no formal document =
has been released for review yet. However, the details shared during the pr=
ess conference suggest a new trans-Atlantic understanding. Under the deal, =
the U.S. will impose a 15 percent tariff on most imports from the EU =E2=80=
=93 half the 30 percent rate Trump had previously threatened =E2=80=93 in e=
xchange for European concessions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The concessions in=
clude a commitment to invest around $600 billion in the U.S. economy, with =
a focus on the infrastructure and technology sectors. The EU has also agree=
d to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy, including oil and natural =
gas, over the next three or so years =E2=80=93 an overt play to reduce Euro=
pe's reliance on Russian energy. Moreover, the EU has agreed to purchase un=
specified amounts of U.S. military equipment. The existing 50 percent tarif=
fs on steel and aluminum will remain in place, though they will transition =
to a quota system to ease their impact.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The agreement will=
 likely help avert a full-scale trade war: Trump's planned tariff increase =
to 30 percent on all EU goods on Aug. 1 was canceled, as was the EU's plann=
ed retaliation on 93 billion euros ($107 billion) of U.S. exports. The deal=
 establishes zero tariffs on specific goods, including aircraft and their c=
omponents, certain chemicals, generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some =
agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials. Though=
 the official framework is still unclear, these provisions suggest a desire=
 to deepen trans-Atlantic technological interdependence, especially with re=
gard to dual-use goods and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The framework mirr=
ors key parts of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement that was reached just a few=
 days earlier, in which Japan agreed to similar terms, reportedly accepting=
 U.S. tariffs on the order of 15 percent to avert 30 percent tariffs at a l=
ater date. European negotiators surely looked to this agreement as a playbo=
ok. German officials, for example, made sure Europe=E2=80=99s auto industry=
 would get the same access to the U.S. market as Japan=E2=80=99s did under =
Tokyo=E2=80=99s deal. In the end, cars and auto parts from the EU will face=
 the same baseline 15 percent tariff that Japan=E2=80=99s do. (This was a r=
elief for German carmakers who had feared being disadvantaged if Japan secu=
red better terms.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Importantly, the a=
greements suggest Europe and Japan were aligned in resisting U.S. protectio=
nism: neither wanted the other to undercut them in the U.S. market. In a br=
oader sense, the fact that the EU and Japan struck similar tariff-reducing =
deals with Washington may encourage closer coordination between Europe and =
Japan. Both economies have championed free trade and multilateral rules in =
recent years, and both found themselves pressured by Trump=E2=80=99s aggres=
sive bilateral tactics. Having made similar compromises with the U.S., Euro=
pe and Japan now have even more reason to present a united front on trade i=
ssues. Analysts suggest this trend could lead to deeper G7 economic integra=
tion. All G7 members =E2=80=93 with the exception of Canada, which is alrea=
dy party to the USMCA =E2=80=93 have now hashed out trade agreements with t=
he Trump administration. The large commitments by Japan and the EU to inves=
t in the U.S. and buy American products will also increase trilateral inter=
dependence.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, EU-Japa=
n bilateral ties =E2=80=93 anchored by a free trade agreement initially agr=
eed to in 2018 and that entered into force in 2025 as a <a href=3D"https://=
geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/408613/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aH=
R0cHM6Ly9kYXRhLmNvbnNpbGl1bS5ldXJvcGEuZXUvZG9jL2RvY3VtZW50L1NULTg0NjItMjAxO=
C1JTklUL2VuL3BkZg" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px =
0px">strategic partnership agreement</a> =E2=80=93 remain strong. That pact=
 continues to eliminate nearly all tariffs between Europe and Japan, a prov=
ision made more valuable by the fact that as U.S. tariffs raise the cost of=
 European and Japanese goods in the United States, Europe and Japan may bol=
ster trade with each other to offset any losses.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In short, the July=
 27 deal puts the EU and Japan on a similar footing with regard to U.S. tra=
de policy, and in doing so, it will likely strengthen their trade relations=
. They share a common experience of weathering Trump=E2=80=99s pressure and=
 will probably collaborate closely to uphold a rules-based trade order and =
ensure that the new U.S. tariff regimes do not unfairly disadvantage their =
industries.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The China =
and Russia Effect</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hovering over all =
of this is the fact that the trans-Atlantic deal will intensify Europe=E2=
=80=99s strategic tilt toward the U.S. and away from China. In recent years=
, the EU=E2=80=99s relationship with China has been complex =E2=80=93 a mix=
 of deep trade ties and growing unease about Beijing=E2=80=99s policies. Fr=
om China=E2=80=99s perspective, the new U.S.-EU trade framework may push Eu=
rope further into the American camp on trade and technology issues, even as=
 U.S.-China tensions escalate. Notably, China has been locked in a trade di=
spute with the U.S. all year. Earlier this year, Beijing responded to U.S. =
tariff hikes with its own punitive tariffs =E2=80=93 reportedly raising dut=
ies on American goods to as high as 125 percent =E2=80=93 in a show of defi=
ance. Some in Europe initially hoped to stay out of the trade war, but the =
July 27 deal means that is no longer possible (if it ever was). By agreeing=
 to buy massive quantities of U.S. liquified natural gas, oil and other exp=
orts while investing in trans-Atlantic infrastructure, the EU is implicitly=
 reducing its reliance on other suppliers that compete with the U.S. and ta=
king similar protectionist measures. Whatever Europe=E2=80=99s relationship=
 with China before July 27, the current deal could have Europe join U.S. ef=
forts to diversify away from Chinese supply chains for strategically sensit=
ive goods.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">By extracting conc=
essions from both Japan and Europe, Washington has strengthened its positio=
n in the broader competition with China. In the past, Chinese leaders have =
urged Europe to maintain =E2=80=9Cstrategic autonomy=E2=80=9D rather than s=
ide with Washington, but this new deal suggests Europe felt compelled to ac=
commodate U.S. demands. Beijing might try to exploit European discontent ov=
er the deal by offering closer trade ties with China as an alternative. How=
ever, any such outreach will be complicated by China=E2=80=99s own disputes=
 with the EU (over issues like human rights and technology transfer) and by=
 China=E2=80=99s alignment with Russia in the Ukraine war, which Europe str=
ongly opposes.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In fact, China=E2=
=80=99s support for Russia is one area where new trans-Atlantic solidarity =
could clash directly with Beijing. Along with the U.S., Europe has tried to=
 discourage China from helping Russia evade sanctions or from supporting th=
e war effort militarily. Now that Europe and the U.S. economically aligned,=
 the Western alliance against Russia =E2=80=93 and, by extension, against C=
hinese assistance to Russia =E2=80=93 is strengthened. Overall, Europe=E2=
=80=99s decision to prioritize a trade truce with Washington sends a signal=
 that trans-Atlantic unity comes before ties with Beijing. Going forward, t=
he EU may coordinate more closely with the U.S. in confronting China on tra=
de practices, export controls and investment screening, especially as China=
 doubles down on its partnership with Moscow to counter Western solidarity.=
</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s unsur=
prising, then, that just hours after the July 27 deal was announced, the Tr=
ump administration set a new deadline for Russia to halt its war in Ukraine=
. Earlier in July, Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum=
: Agree to peace in 50 days or face stiff penalties. But on July 28, appare=
ntly frustrated by continued Russian aggression, Trump shortened the deadli=
ne to just 10-12 days, insisting there was no reason to wait any longer. He=
 made it clear that if Moscow did not comply by the new deadline, the U.S. =
would impose secondary sanctions, beginning with 100 percent tariffs on any=
 country that continued to trade with Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This is an unprece=
dented escalation =E2=80=93 effectively a form of secondary sanction aimed =
at Russia=E2=80=99s top trade partners, notably China and India, as well as=
 others such as Brazil and Turkey. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte met wi=
th Trump in mid-July to coordinate on the strategy. The goal is to pressure=
 these countries to stop supporting Russia=E2=80=99s war effort.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For China, which i=
s Russia=E2=80=99s largest trade partner and a key buyer of its oil, gas an=
d commodities, Trump=E2=80=99s ultimatum creates a strategic dilemma. If im=
plemented, <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/408613/5e270=

2px 0px">100 percent secondary tariffs would be devastating</a> =E2=80=93 e=
ssentially pricing Chinese goods out of the U.S. market or otherwise sancti=
oning Chinese firms and banks involved with Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Beijing has respon=
ded with defiance. Rather than distance himself from Moscow, President Xi J=
inping pledged to =E2=80=9Cdeepen China=E2=80=99s support for Russia.=E2=80=
=9D During a meeting with Russia=E2=80=99s foreign minister, Xi emphasized =
the need to implement recent bilateral agreements and called for closer coo=
peration on global issues. He advocated a united effort between Beijing and=
 Moscow to rally the Global South against Western pressure and promote a mo=
re multipolar world order. This was a clear public reaffirmation of the Chi=
na-Russia partnership, even in the face of potential U.S. sanctions. Chines=
e state media reported that Xi and Putin agreed to jointly protect their de=
velopment and security interests while working to reform the international =
order in a fairer direction =E2=80=93 a subtle reference to resisting U.S.-=
led sanctions and dominance.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">If China follows t=
hrough on its stance, it will probably shield its trade with Russia as much=
 as possible, consequences be damned. China may increase its use of yuan cu=
rrency settlements and alternative payment systems to continue trading with=
 Russia while avoiding U.S. financial channels. Already, China has provided=
 an economic lifeline to Moscow by purchasing record amounts of Russian oil=
, often at a discount, and supplying various goods. However, these trade fl=
ows could be threatened if Western shipping, insurance companies or Chinese=
 firms become wary of potential U.S. penalties.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Otherwise, Beijing=
 may try to determine whether it should weather the storm or retaliate in k=
ind. China is happy to escalate tensions, as it did earlier this year, reta=
liating against U.S. duties by imposing its own tariff hikes =E2=80=93 some=
 as high as 125 percent =E2=80=93 on American imports. If Trump imposes 100=
 percent tariffs on countries that trade with Russia, China could respond b=
y implementing similarly harsh tariffs on U.S. goods or by restricting expo=
rts of critical materials that are essential to U.S. industries. This would=
 effectively trigger a trade war beyond the scale of any in the first Trump=
 administration. The global economic fallout would be significant, but Beij=
ing may be willing to endure some pain to demonstrate its resolve.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Crucially, seconda=
ry sanctions would challenge China=E2=80=99s energy security. China receive=
s more than 15 percent of its oil imports and a significant portion of its =
piped gas from Russia. China would need to quickly seek alternative sources=
 if they were cut, likely from the Middle East or Africa, and likely at hig=
her spot prices. But if Beijing continues purchasing Russian oil in defianc=
e of sanctions, insurers and shipping companies might pull out of China alt=
ogether to avoid U.S. penalties. To prevent that from happening, China may =
resort to using its own shadow fleet of sanctioned tankers, or expand its o=
verland pipeline capacity to keep Russian energy coming in. Either way, pro=
curement costs would increase. The mere threat of sanctions has already mad=
e Chinese banks and businesses more cautious in dealing with Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But Beijing has ma=
de it clear that it does not support Western sanctions on Russia and has no=
 intention of seeing Russia weakened by them. Xi and Putin have already dec=
lared a =E2=80=9Cno limits=E2=80=9D partnership, and they pledged to =E2=80=
=9Cdecisively oppose U.S. hegemony=E2=80=9D together. Even so, there may be=
 limits to Beijing=E2=80=99s actions. The EU is a major export destination =
for China, comparable to the U.S., and Japan is a top trade partner. If the=
 U.S., the EU and Japan continue to align under a framework trade deal, as =
they appear to be doing, China will be forced to decide whether it can bear=
 the consequences of losing its top export markets, particularly at a time =
when its internal economic stability <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">By threatening to =
apply sanctions on Russia and its allies so soon after forging trade agreem=
ents, the U.S. is trying to manufacture a new order with itself still at th=
e center. For this strategy to work, there must be a belief that the Trump =
administration will honor its threats. Washington has balked before, and it=
s competitors likely hope it will do so again.</p>
