le-why-the-doom-narrative

This week I=E2=80=99ve been watching the AI narrative collapse in real-time=
, and it's fascinating for all the wrong reasons.
Sam Altman made an off-the-cuff remark about bubbles. Meta is laying off so=
me in their AI division. AI tech stocks are having a down week. GPT-5 disap=
pointed lots and lots of people.=20
The prophets of doom are having their moment.
But as fun as it is to ride the narrative rollercoaster, the prophets of do=
om are incorrect. Things aren=E2=80=99t as gloomy as people make out, and I=
 think there are solid reasons why it looks doom-y at first glance anyway.
This note lays out why I think we=E2=80=99re hearing this narrative everywh=
ere, what people are forgetting about how AI works, and where we go next.
Let me show you what everyone's missing.

The AI Bubble That Wasn't: A Story of Misread Signals
The headlines are everywhere this week. Sam Altman admits we're in an AI bu=
bble. Meta freezes AI hiring after its lavish spending spree. MIT finds 95%=
 of enterprise AI projects are failing. The prophets of doom are having the=
ir moment.
Last night on X, I watched the narrative crystallize in real-time. Tweet af=
ter tweet about AI winter or about AI hype being over or about impending st=
ock collapse. The sentiment has shifted so fast it's giving people whiplash=
=2E
But here's what's actually happening, beneath the noise.
The Perfect Storm
Four things are converging right now to create this bubble narrative, and i=
f you don't see how they fit together, you'll miss what's really going on.
First, people desperately need a new story. We spent months building up GPT=
-5 as the second coming. When it launched last week and users found it cold=
, impersonal, even inferior to GPT-4 in some ways, the backlash was swift a=
nd brutal. Sam Altman had to issue that rare public apology=E2=80=94"We tot=
ally screwed up"=E2=80=94and now thousands of users have signed petitions d=
emanding their old models back. The hype pendulum had swung too far; now it=
's swinging back with vengeance.
Second, Meta's AI division restructuring hit the news cycle at exactly the =
wrong moment. After months of throwing astronomical compensation packages a=
t anyone who could spell "transformer," they suddenly freeze hiring and ann=
ounce a reorganization into four separate units. The optics are terrible, e=
ven if the reality is more complex.
Third, Sam himself uttered the magic word at that dinner with reporters on =
Monday. "Are we in a phase where investors, in general, are overexcited abo=
ut AI? My opinion is yes." He went on to compare it to the dot-com era, war=
ning that "someone's going to get burnt" on overvalued AI startups. When th=
e CEO of OpenAI says bubble, the world listens.
Fourth, MIT's study lands like a bomb in the middle of all this. 95% of cor=
porate generative AI pilots failing to deliver meaningful returns. Companie=
s have poured $35-40 billion into generative AI with almost nothing to show=
 for it. The timing couldn't be worse for the AI optimists.
The market's responding predictably. Tech stocks are down. Nvidia dropped 3=
=2E5% this week. The narrative has taken hold.
What We're Missing
But narratives seduce us precisely because they simplify. They transform me=
ssy reality into clean stories. And this bubble narrative is missing five c=
rucial facts that completely change the picture.
First: The chatbot use case is saturating, and Sam's actually being honest =
about it. In the same interview everyone's quoting about bubbles, he said s=
omething more interesting: ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users and "pretty=
 soon billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT." The chatbot int=
erface is good enough. Making the model smarter doesn't fundamentally chang=
e that experience anymore. This isn't failure; it's market maturity in one =
specific application.
Second: Progress hasn't stopped; it's moving to places most people can't se=
e. Take the debate raging on X right now about whether GPT-5 Pro just creat=
ed a genuinely new mathematical proof. The consensus emerging is yes, it's =
real innovation, but it's different from human innovation=E2=80=94brute for=
ce calculation through a problem space rather than intuitive leaps. The nua=
nce of that distinction is lost on most observers, but it matters enormousl=
y for understanding where AI is headed.
Third: On any benchmark that isn't saturated, progress continues exponentia=
lly. METR's autonomy evaluation is my current favorite because it hasn't to=
pped out. It simply asks: can an AI complete a task that takes a skilled hu=
man X hours, successfully at least 50% of the time? We keep doubling capabi=
lity every few months. No plateau. No slowdown.
Fourth: We're still desperately under-allocated on chips, and this is the t=
ell that everyone's missing. In that same dinner where Sam talked about bub=
bles, he admitted: "We have better models and we can't release them because=
 we don't have the capacity." Think about that. OpenAI has built smarter mo=
dels that they literally cannot deploy because demand for their current mod=
els is too high. Anthropic faces the same constraint. If AI interest was co=
oling, would we have a chip shortage?
Fifth: Meta's restructuring isn't retreat; it's preparation for the next ph=
ase. Their new chief AI officer's internal memo, which leaked yesterday, do=
esn't sound like capitulation: "Superintelligence is coming, and in order t=
o take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be =
critical to reach it." That's not the language of a company backing away fr=
om AI.
Reading the MIT Study Right
That MIT study deserves closer examination because everyone's interpreting =
it backwards. Yes, 95% of enterprise AI projects are failing. But think abo=
ut what that means: 95% of companies are trying so hard to implement AI tha=
t they're running pilots. The demand signal is deafening.
More importantly, look at what the 5% who succeed are achieving. The study =
mentions startups jumping from zero to $20 million in revenue within a year=
=2E Established companies seeing what t=
hey call "exponential gains" in produc=
tivity. The failures aren't about AI's limitations=E2=80=94they're about im=
plementation. Companies trying to build their own tools instead of partneri=
ng. Focusing on the wrong use cases. Lacking proper data infrastructure. Mi=
ssing the cultural change management entirely.
If AI didn't work, companies would try it once and quit. Instead, they're f=
ailing and immediately trying again, because they've seen what happens to t=
he ones who get it right. That's not bubble behavior; that's recognition of=
 existential stakes.
The Power Law Game
What the bubble narrative completely misses is that we're playing a power l=
aw game now, and power law dynamics explain everything weird we're seeing.
In a power law world, the companies that get AI right don't see 20% improve=
ments. They see 10x transformations. When those are the stakes, it's ration=
al to keep investing even if your success probability is low. The expected =
value is still positive.
This extends to the model makers. When intelligence improvements follow a p=
ower law, and when capturing even a small slice of the AI market could mean=
 trillion-dollar valuations, spending billions on talent and compute isn't =
irrational exuberance=E2=80=94it's rational capital allocation in a winner-=
take-most market.
The consolidation we're witnessing=E2=80=94fewer labs seriously competing a=
t the frontier=E2=80=94actually signals market maturity, not bubble dynamic=
s. Amazon has quietly ceded the model race (at least it looks like it). Mic=
rosoft has chosen to be the infrastructure provider rather than compete wit=
h OpenAI directly. Apple is scrambling just to stay relevant. This isn't th=
e behavior you see in bubbles, where everyone piles in regardless of compet=
itive advantage. This is strategic positioning by players who understand th=
e real costs.
The Paradox of Bubble Talk
I've lived through real bubbles. Dot-com in 2000. Housing in 2008. Crypto i=
n 2021. Here's what I know: the one thing you never see in a bubble is peop=
le talking about the bubble.
In a real bubble, skeptics are dismissed as dinosaurs. Your taxi driver is =
giving you stock tips. Your grandmother wants to know how to buy NFTs. Ever=
yone's a true believer, and the few warning voices are drowned out by the c=
horus of "this time is different."
Right now? We're having widespread, serious discussions about whether AI is=
 overhyped. The Financial Times is running skeptical pieces. Even the bulls=
 are adding caveats.=20
That's not bubble psychology. That's the messy middle of a real transformat=
ion.
What's Actually Happening
We're not in a bubble. We're in a transition from the easy, visible wins to=
 the harder, more valuable applications.
The chatbot era gave everyone something tangible. My mom uses ChatGPT. That=
 amazement phase is ending, not because AI stopped improving, but because w=
e've normalized it. Now we're moving into enterprise automation, agentic sy=
stems, specialized applications. These are less visible but more transforma=
tive.
A consumer can't see when a pharmaceutical company uses AI to design new dr=
ug compounds 10x faster. They can't see when a logistics company optimizes =
routing to save millions in fuel costs. They can't see when a law firm auto=
mates document review to handle cases that were economically impossible bef=
ore. But these invisible transformations are where the real value lives.
Yes, there's froth. Every startup is slapping a "What do you want to build =
today?" box on their homepage, desperately copying Lovable's success. Airta=
ble just did it, and frankly, they should know better. But froth isn't a bu=
bble. Froth is what happens when genuine value creation attracts imitators.
The Real Story
What we're witnessing isn't a bubble bursting. It's an industry growing up.=
 The shift from "AI will change everything tomorrow" to "AI will change eve=
rything, but it's going to be messy and take work."
When Sam says OpenAI plans to spend trillions on data centers, he's not tal=
king bubble talk. He's talking about meeting genuine demand they currently =
can't serve. The companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure aren't d=
runk on hype. They've run the numbers, and even with high failure rates, th=
e expected value is positive.
The narrative wants to be simple: AI was overhyped, now reality is setting =
in. But the reality is more nuanced: AI is delivering transformative value,=
 but only for those who figure out implementation. The technology works. Th=
e challenge is organizational, cultural, strategic.
We're not in a bubble. We're in a gold rush where most prospectors are fail=
ing because they don't know how to pan for gold, not because there's no gol=
d. And unlike most gold rushes, this one is just beginning. The real AI tra=
nsformation=E2=80=94the boring, valuable, enterprise stuff that actually ch=
anges how the economy works=E2=80=94is only now getting started.
Be skeptical of the hype. But be equally skeptical of the doom. The truth, =
as always, is messier and more interesting than either narrative suggests.

AI hiring after its lavish spending spree. MIT finds 95% of enterprise AI p=

x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Four things ar=
e converging right now to create this bubble narrative, and if you don't se=
e how they fit together, you'll miss what's really going on.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">First, people desperately need a new story. We spent months building up G=
PT-5 as the second coming. When it launched last week and users found it co=
ld, impersonal, even inferior to GPT-4 in some ways, the backlash was swift=
 and brutal. Sam Altman had to issue that rare public apology=E2=80=94&quot=
;We totally screwed up&quot;=E2=80=94and now thousands of users have signed=
 petitions demanding their old models back. The hype pendulum had swung too=
 far; now it's swinging back with vengeance.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, Meta's=
 AI division restructuring hit the news cycle at exactly the wrong moment. =
After months of throwing astronomical compensation packages at anyone who c=
ould spell &quot;transformer,&quot; they suddenly freeze hiring and announc=
e a reorganization into four separate units. The optics are terrible, even =
if the reality is more complex.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Third, Sam himself uttered =
the magic word at that dinner with reporters on Monday. &quot;Are we in a p=
hase where investors, in general, are overexcited about AI? My opinion is y=
es.&quot; He went on to compare it to the dot-com era, warning that &quot;s=
omeone's going to get burnt&quot; on overvalued AI startups. When the CEO o=
f OpenAI says bubble, the world listens.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Fourth, MIT's stud=
y lands like a bomb in the middle of all this. 95% of corporate generative =
AI pilots failing to deliver meaningful returns. Companies have poured $35-=
40 billion into generative AI with almost nothing to show for it. The timin=
g couldn't be worse for the AI optimists.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The market's resp=
onding predictably. Tech stocks are down. Nvidia dropped 3.5% this week. Th=
e narrative has taken hold.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"po=

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">But narratives seduce us precisely because they simplify. They trans=
form messy reality into clean stories. And this bubble narrative is missing=
 five crucial facts that completely change the picture.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><st=
rong>First:</strong><span> The chatbot use case is saturating, and Sam's ac=
tually being honest about it. In the same interview everyone's quoting abou=
t bubbles, he said something more interesting: ChatGPT has 700 million week=
ly users and &quot;pretty soon billions of people a day will be talking to =
ChatGPT.&quot; The chatbot interface is good enough. Making the model smart=
er doesn't fundamentally change that experience anymore. This isn't failure=
; it's market maturity in one specific application.</span></p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
<strong>Second:</strong><span> Progress hasn't stopped; it's moving to plac=
es most people can't see. Take the debate raging on X right now about wheth=
er GPT-5 Pro just created a genuinely new mathematical proof. The consensus=
 emerging is yes, it's real innovation, but it's different from human innov=
ation=E2=80=94brute force calculation through a problem space rather than i=
ntuitive leaps. The nuance of that distinction is lost on most observers, b=
ut it matters enormously for understanding where AI is headed.</span></p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;"><strong>Third:</strong><span> On any benchmark that isn't satura=
ted, progress continues exponentially. METR's autonomy evaluation is my cur=
rent favorite because it hasn't topped out. It simply asks: can an AI compl=
ete a task that takes a skilled human X hours, successfully at least 50% of=
 the time? We keep doubling capability every few months. No plateau. No slo=
wdown.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Fourth:</strong><span> We're still de=
sperately under-allocated on chips, and this is the tell that everyone's mi=
ssing. In that same dinner where Sam talked about bubbles, he admitted: &qu=
ot;We have better models and we can't release them because we don't have th=
e capacity.&quot; Think about that. OpenAI has built smarter models that th=
ey literally cannot deploy because demand for their current models is too h=
igh. Anthropic faces the same constraint. If AI interest was cooling, would=
 we have a chip shortage?</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Fifth:</strong><sp=
an> Meta's restructuring isn't retreat; it's preparation for the next phase=
. Their new chief AI officer's internal memo, which leaked yesterday, doesn=
't sound like capitulation: &quot;Superintelligence is coming, and in order=
 to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will b=
e critical to reach it.&quot; That's not the language of a company backing =
away from AI.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position:=

: 16px;">That MIT study deserves closer examination because everyone's inte=
rpreting it backwards. Yes, 95% of enterprise AI projects are failing. But =
think about what that means: 95% of companies are trying so hard to impleme=
nt AI that they're running pilots. The demand signal is deafening.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">More importantly, look at what the 5% who succeed are achieving. Th=
e study mentions startups jumping from zero to $20 million in revenue withi=
n a year. Established companies seeing what they call &quot;exponential gai=
ns&quot; in productivity. The failures aren't about AI's limitations=E2=80=
=94they're about implementation. Companies trying to build their own tools =
instead of partnering. Focusing on the wrong use cases. Lacking proper data=
 infrastructure. Missing the cultural change management entirely.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">If AI didn't work, companies would try it once and quit. Instead, th=
ey're failing and immediately trying again, because they've seen what happe=
ns to the ones who get it right. That's not bubble behavior; that's recogni=
tion of existential stakes.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"po=

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">What the bubble narrative completely misses is that we're playing a =
power law game now, and power law dynamics explain everything weird we're s=
eeing.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">In a power law world, the companies that get AI righ=
t don't see 20% improvements. They see 10x transformations. When those are =
the stakes, it's rational to keep investing even if your success probabilit=
y is low. The expected value is still positive.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This extend=
s to the model makers. When intelligence improvements follow a power law, a=
nd when capturing even a small slice of the AI market could mean trillion-d=
ollar valuations, spending billions on talent and compute isn't irrational =
exuberance=E2=80=94it's rational capital allocation in a winner-take-most m=
arket.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =

s seriously competing at the frontier=E2=80=94actually signals market matur=
ity, not bubble dynamics. Amazon has quietly ceded the model race (at least=
 it looks like it). Microsoft has chosen to be the infrastructure provider =
rather than compete with OpenAI directly. Apple is scrambling just to stay =
relevant. This isn't the behavior you see in bubbles, where everyone piles =
in regardless of competitive advantage. This is strategic positioning by pl=
ayers who understand the real costs.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" st=

e Talk</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">I've lived through real bubbles. Dot-com in 2000. H=
ousing in 2008. Crypto in 2021. Here's what I know: the one thing you never=
 see in a bubble is people talking about the bubble.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">In a r=
eal bubble, skeptics are dismissed as dinosaurs. Your taxi driver is giving=
 you stock tips. Your grandmother wants to know how to buy NFTs. Everyone's=
 a true believer, and the few warning voices are drowned out by the chorus =
of &quot;this time is different.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Right now? We're hav=
ing widespread, serious discussions about whether AI is overhyped. The Fina=
ncial Times is running skeptical pieces. Even the bulls are adding caveats.=
 </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=

tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">We're not in a bubble. We're in a transition from the easy, visibl=
e wins to the harder, more valuable applications.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =
0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The chatb=
ot era gave everyone something tangible. My mom uses ChatGPT. That amazemen=
t phase is ending, not because AI stopped improving, but because we've norm=
alized it. Now we're moving into enterprise automation, agentic systems, sp=
ecialized applications. These are less visible but more transformative.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">A consumer can't see when a pharmaceutical company uses AI to =
design new drug compounds 10x faster. They can't see when a logistics compa=
ny optimizes routing to save millions in fuel costs. They can't see when a =
law firm automates document review to handle cases that were economically i=
mpossible before. But these invisible transformations are where the real va=
lue lives.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Yes, there's froth. Every startup is slapping a =
&quot;What do you want to build today?&quot; box on their homepage, despera=
tely copying Lovable's success. Airtable just did it, and frankly, they sho=
uld know better. But froth isn't a bubble. Froth is what happens when genui=
ne value creation attracts imitators.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" s=

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">What we're witnessing isn't a bubble bursting. It's an industr=
y growing up. The shift from &quot;AI will change everything tomorrow&quot;=
 to &quot;AI will change everything, but it's going to be messy and take wo=
rk.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When Sam says OpenAI plans to spend trillions on =
data centers, he's not talking bubble talk. He's talking about meeting genu=
ine demand they currently can't serve. The companies pouring billions into =
AI infrastructure aren't drunk on hype. They've run the numbers, and even w=
ith high failure rates, the expected value is positive.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The=
 narrative wants to be simple: AI was overhyped, now reality is setting in.=
 But the reality is more nuanced: AI is delivering transformative value, bu=
t only for those who figure out implementation. The technology works. The c=
hallenge is organizational, cultural, strategic.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We're not =
in a bubble. We're in a gold rush where most prospectors are failing becaus=
e they don't know how to pan for gold, not because there's no gold. And unl=
ike most gold rushes, this one is just beginning. The real AI transformatio=
