VICTORY DAY AND THE WEAPONIZATION OF MEMORY [3]
THE MANIPULATION OF HISTORY IS NOT NEW, BUT TODAY’S GEOPOLITICAL CLIMATE MAKES IT MORE DANGEROUS.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
I am currently in Prague to teach a course on geoeconomics as part of a master’s program in geopolitics at Charles University. While here, I am observing the celebration of Victory in Europe Day,
commemorating Germany’s surrender in World War II. It is a national holiday, and the atmosphere around the university – a neighborhood of residential blocks and office buildings – is quiet.
Coffee shops open later than usual, some stores remain closed, and local restaurants mainly serve residents and a few holiday visitors. The commemoration is marked by small but solemn gestures: Local
police place flowers on WWII memorial plaques, and passersby pause to read them or explain their meaning to children.
The Czech Republic observes Victory Day on May 8, following the Western European tradition, instead of the Soviet May 9. Slovakia does the same. This choice distinguishes both countries from much of
the former Eastern Bloc. (During the Cold War, they were united as a single satellite, Czechoslovakia, but in 1992, they split while keeping similar commemorative practices.) In Western European
countries such as France, the U.K. and Belgium, May 8 is a public holiday marked with subdued ceremonies and solemn reflection, not military parades or grand state displays. I once spent May 8 in a
village in Normandy, where a wreath-laying ceremony at the local war memorial and cemetery and a few words from officials emphasized peace and reconciliation over triumph.
In these countries, May 8 serves as a remembrance of war’s victims and a warning against totalitarianism. Its restrained tone reflects Western Europe’s postwar legacy, which is about not only the
defeat of Nazi Germany but also the founding of institutions like NATO and the EU, designed to prevent future conflict. More than a military victory, in this part of the world, May 8 is about the
rebirth of liberal democracy and the rejection of militarism, nationalism and division.
In contrast, many Eastern European countries – such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states – do not observe May 8 or May 9 as national holidays. Their memory of WWII and its aftermath
is more painful and complex. (In most EU countries, May 9 is celebrated as Europe Day, commemorating the 1950 Schuman Declaration, which laid the foundation for European integration through peace
rather than war.) For much of Eastern Europe, 1945 marked the end of one occupation and the start of another. The Soviet “liberation” put an end to the Nazis’ atrocities, but repression soon
followed, which included deportations, purges and the silencing of dissent under Stalin. After regaining independence, these countries revised their historical narratives. Romania, Latvia and Estonia
dismantled Soviet-era monuments honoring the Red Army. Poland rewrote school curricula to highlight its dual occupation by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
In 2023, Ukraine shifted its WWII commemoration from May 9 to May 8. On that day, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree naming May 8 the "Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World
War II 1939-1945." Later that month, the Ukrainian parliament made it a public holiday. This ended the dual observance introduced in 2015, when President Petro Poroshenko added May 8 as the "Day of
Remembrance and Reconciliation" while keeping May 9 as the "Victory Day over Nazism." It also underscored Ukraine’s move away from Russian influence over historical memory.
Still, remnants of Soviet-style Victory Day commemorations appear in unexpected places. In Hungary, for example, official ceremonies and wreath-layings on May 9 echo old traditions, despite the
country's strong nationalism and the bitter memory of the Soviet army’s suppression of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. It is a paradox. Every time I visited Budapest – especially when
accompanying George Friedman – we were reminded that Hungary never forgave the United States for failing to intervene during the uprising. The resentment lingers, as if the country still expects an
apology or acknowledgment.
Like the Czech Republic, Hungary sits at a Central European crossroads. But while the Czech Republic is culturally and politically anchored in Western Europe, drawing influence from Germany, France
and the Benelux countries, Hungary leans in a different direction. Its identity is shaped not only by Central Europe but also by the Balkans and Russia. This dual orientation helps explain
Budapest’s complex and often ambivalent foreign policy.
Given its historical distrust of the United States – rooted in 1956 and sustained by decades of strategic pragmatism – it is not surprising that Hungary would seek comfort and leverage from
engagement with Russia. What is more revealing is that even Washington appears to be rethinking its stance, treating Russia less as a rival and more as a necessary, if difficult, partner in select
arenas. In that light, Hungary’s approach looks less like defiance and more like strategic adaptation to a world of shifting alliances and transactional diplomacy.
Hungary’s balancing act reflects a broader narrative that Russia is trying to shape around Victory Day. On May 9, Moscow stages its traditional display of grandeur: Tanks roll through Red Square,
veterans sport their medals, and President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech about wartime valor and national destiny. But the event is no longer just about remembrance – it is about power. Victory
Day has become central to the Kremlin’s ideological project, turning a symbol of unity into an instrument of division. It reinforces the image of Russia as the eternal bulwark against fascism and
foreign threats – a myth repurposed to legitimize Moscow’s current military campaigns, especially in Ukraine, where it labels opponents as “Nazis” to both mobilize the domestic populace and
provoke the international community.
The manipulation of history is not new, but today’s geopolitical climate makes it more dangerous. No longer about remembering the past, Victory Day now asserts a vision of the present – one in
which Russia is encircled by a hostile West and must show strength. It is not just diplomatic theater; it is a calculated message to the West. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s attendance at the event
this year signals the growing strategic alignment between Moscow and Beijing – rooted not in ideology but in shared interests and resentment toward U.S. global dominance. His presence lends
international legitimacy to Putin’s narrative and challenges the notion that Russia is isolated.
For China, Victory Day offers a platform to project its vision of a multipolar world – one where Western liberalism no longer dictates the rules of global engagement. Though Xi is unlikely to pledge
direct military support to Russia, his presence is a calculated response to Western sanctions and a symbolic alignment on broader issues, from NATO enlargement to economic coercion. The image of the
Chinese and Russian leaders standing together resonates beyond Europe, particularly in parts of the Global South where skepticism toward Western institutions runs deep.
In this context, Victory Day is no longer a day of shared remembrance – it is a stage for geopolitical signaling. What once marked the defeat of Nazism and the unity of the Allied powers now
reflects the deep fractures of a shifting world order and the rise of alternative centers of power. A day once emblematic of joint resistance to tyranny has become a litmus test of global alignment,
with rivalry replacing reconciliation. Russia clings to its WWII legacy, casting itself as the last bulwark against Western dominance. China amplifies that narrative, not out of shared ideology but to
further its own challenge to U.S. hegemony. The meaning of 1945 has been stripped of its universal message and repurposed. It is no longer a call for peace – it is a tool for expressing grievances,
legitimizing power and forging alternative alliances.
In this new era of great power competition, history has become more of a strategic asset. It is curated to mobilize societies, frame diplomacy and justify confrontation. From Prague’s quiet
commemorations to Moscow’s militarized spectacle, from Brussels’ celebration of unity to Xi’s high-profile appearance in Red Square, May 8 and May 9 now do more than mark the end of a war –
they reveal the contours of a new global contest. Victory Day in 2025 is not just about remembering the past. It reflects the kind of future we are entering – one in which memory is political,
alliances are transactional, and even the past is negotiable.

Prague to teach a course on geoeconomics as part of a master=E2=80=99s prog=
ram in geopolitics at Charles University. While here, I am observing the ce=
lebration of Victory in Europe Day, commemorating Germany=E2=80=99s surrend=
er in World War II. It is a national holiday, and the atmosphere around the=
 university =E2=80=93 a neighborhood of residential blocks and office build=
ings =E2=80=93 is quiet. Coffee shops open later than usual, some stores re=
main closed, and local restaurants mainly serve residents and a few holiday=
 visitors. The commemoration is marked by small but solemn gestures: Local =
police place flowers on WWII memorial plaques, and passersby pause to read =
them or explain their meaning to children.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Czech Republic=
 observes Victory Day on May 8, following the Western European tradition, i=
nstead of the Soviet May 9. Slovakia does the same. This choice distinguish=
es both countries from much of the former Eastern Bloc. (During the Cold Wa=
r, they were united as a single satellite, Czechoslovakia, but in 1992, the=
y split while keeping similar commemorative practices.) In Western European=
 countries such as France, the U.K. and Belgium, May 8 is a public holiday =
marked with subdued ceremonies and solemn reflection, not military parades =
or grand state displays. I once spent May 8 in a village in Normandy, where=
 a wreath-laying ceremony at the local war memorial and cemetery and a few =
words from officials emphasized peace and reconciliation over triumph.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In these countries=
, May 8 serves as a remembrance of war=E2=80=99s victims and a warning agai=
nst totalitarianism. Its restrained tone reflects Western Europe=E2=80=99s =
postwar legacy, which is about not only the defeat of Nazi Germany but also=
 the founding of institutions like NATO and the EU, designed to prevent fut=
ure conflict. More than a military victory, in this part of the world, May =
8 is about the rebirth of liberal democracy and the rejection of militarism=
, nationalism and division.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In contrast, many =
Eastern European countries =E2=80=93 such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and =
the Baltic states =E2=80=93 do not observe May 8 or May 9 as national holid=
ays. Their memory of WWII and its aftermath is more painful and complex. (I=
n most EU countries, May 9 is celebrated as Europe Day, commemorating the 1=
950 Schuman Declaration, which laid the foundation for European integration=
 through peace rather than war.) For much of Eastern Europe, 1945 marked th=
e end of one occupation and the start of another. The Soviet =E2=80=9Cliber=
ation=E2=80=9D put an end to the Nazis=E2=80=99 atrocities, but repression =
soon followed, which included deportations, purges and the silencing of dis=
sent under Stalin. After regaining independence, these countries revised th=
eir historical narratives. Romania, Latvia and Estonia dismantled Soviet-er=
a monuments honoring the Red Army. Poland rewrote school curricula to highl=
ight its dual occupation by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 2023, Ukraine s=
hifted its WWII commemoration from May 9 to May 8. On that day, President V=
olodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree naming May 8 the &quot;Day of Remembranc=
e and Victory over Nazism in World War II 1939-1945.&quot; Later that month=
, the Ukrainian parliament made it a public holiday. This ended the dual ob=
servance introduced in 2015, when President Petro Poroshenko added May 8 as=
 the &quot;Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation&quot; while keeping May 9 =
as the &quot;Victory Day over Nazism.&quot; It also underscored Ukraine=E2=
=80=99s move away from Russian influence over historical memory.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Still, remnants of=
 Soviet-style Victory Day commemorations appear in unexpected places. In Hu=
ngary, for example, official ceremonies and wreath-layings on May 9 echo ol=
d traditions, despite the country's strong nationalism and the bitter memor=
y of the Soviet army=E2=80=99s suppression of the Hungarian Revolution in 1=
956. It is a paradox. Every time I visited Budapest =E2=80=93 especially wh=
en accompanying George Friedman =E2=80=93 we were reminded that Hungary nev=
er forgave the United States for failing to intervene during the uprising. =
The resentment lingers, as if the country still expects an apology or ackno=
wledgment.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Like the Czech Rep=
ublic, Hungary sits at a Central European crossroads. But while the Czech R=
epublic is culturally and politically anchored in Western Europe, drawing i=
nfluence from Germany, France and the Benelux countries, Hungary leans in a=
 different direction. Its identity is shaped not only by Central Europe but=
 also by the Balkans and Russia. This dual orientation helps explain Budape=
st=E2=80=99s complex and often ambivalent foreign policy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Given its historic=
al distrust of the United States =E2=80=93 rooted in 1956 and sustained by =
decades of strategic pragmatism =E2=80=93 it is not surprising that Hungary=
 would seek comfort and leverage from engagement with Russia. What is more =
revealing is that even Washington appears to be rethinking its stance, trea=
ting Russia less as a rival and more as a necessary, if difficult, partner =
in select arenas. In that light, Hungary=E2=80=99s approach looks less like=
 defiance and more like strategic adaptation to a world of shifting allianc=
es and transactional diplomacy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hungary=E2=80=99s =
balancing act reflects a broader narrative that Russia is trying to shape a=
round Victory Day. On May 9, Moscow stages its traditional display of grand=
eur: Tanks roll through Red Square, veterans sport their medals, and Presid=
ent Vladimir Putin delivers a speech about wartime valor and national desti=
ny. But the event is no longer just about remembrance =E2=80=93 it is about=
 power. Victory Day has become central to the Kremlin=E2=80=99s ideological=
 project, turning a symbol of unity into an instrument of division. It rein=
forces the image of Russia as the eternal bulwark against fascism and forei=
gn threats =E2=80=93 a myth repurposed to legitimize Moscow=E2=80=99s curre=
nt military campaigns, especially in Ukraine, where it labels opponents as =
=E2=80=9CNazis=E2=80=9D to both mobilize the domestic populace and provoke =
the international community.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The manipulation o=
f history is not new, but today=E2=80=99s geopolitical climate makes it mor=
e dangerous. No longer about remembering the past, Victory Day now asserts =
a vision of the present =E2=80=93 one in which Russia is encircled by a hos=
tile West and must show strength. It is not just diplomatic theater; it is =
a calculated message to the West. Chinese President Xi Jinping=E2=80=99s at=
tendance at the event this year signals the growing strategic alignment bet=
ween Moscow and Beijing =E2=80=93 rooted not in ideology but in shared inte=
rests and resentment toward U.S. global dominance. His presence lends inter=
national legitimacy to Putin=E2=80=99s narrative and challenges the notion =
that Russia is isolated.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For China, Victory=
 Day offers a platform to project its vision of a multipolar world =E2=80=
=93 one where Western liberalism no longer dictates the rules of global eng=
agement. Though Xi is unlikely to pledge direct military support to Russia,=
 his presence is a calculated response to Western sanctions and a symbolic =
alignment on broader issues, from NATO enlargement to economic coercion. Th=
e image of the Chinese and Russian leaders standing together resonates beyo=
nd Europe, particularly in parts of the Global South where skepticism towar=
d Western institutions runs deep.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In this context, V=
ictory Day is no longer a day of shared remembrance =E2=80=93 it is a stage=
 for geopolitical signaling. What once marked the defeat of Nazism and the =
unity of the Allied powers now reflects the deep fractures of a shifting wo=
rld order and the rise of alternative centers of power. A day once emblemat=
ic of joint resistance to tyranny has become a litmus test of global alignm=
ent, with rivalry replacing reconciliation. Russia clings to its WWII legac=
y, casting itself as the last bulwark against Western dominance. China ampl=
ifies that narrative, not out of shared ideology but to further its own cha=
llenge to U.S. hegemony. The meaning of 1945 has been stripped of its unive=
rsal message and repurposed. It is no longer a call for peace =E2=80=93 it =
is a tool for expressing grievances, legitimizing power and forging alterna=
tive alliances.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In this new era of=
 great power competition, history has become more of a strategic asset. It =
is curated to mobilize societies, frame diplomacy and justify confrontation=
. From Prague=E2=80=99s quiet commemorations to Moscow=E2=80=99s militarize=
d spectacle, from Brussels=E2=80=99 celebration of unity to Xi=E2=80=99s hi=
gh-profile appearance in Red Square, May 8 and May 9 now do more than mark =
the end of a war =E2=80=93 they reveal the contours of a new global contest=
. Victory Day in 2025 is not just about remembering the past. It reflects t=
he kind of future we are entering =E2=80=93 one in which memory is politica=
l, alliances are transactional, and even the past is negotiable.</p>
