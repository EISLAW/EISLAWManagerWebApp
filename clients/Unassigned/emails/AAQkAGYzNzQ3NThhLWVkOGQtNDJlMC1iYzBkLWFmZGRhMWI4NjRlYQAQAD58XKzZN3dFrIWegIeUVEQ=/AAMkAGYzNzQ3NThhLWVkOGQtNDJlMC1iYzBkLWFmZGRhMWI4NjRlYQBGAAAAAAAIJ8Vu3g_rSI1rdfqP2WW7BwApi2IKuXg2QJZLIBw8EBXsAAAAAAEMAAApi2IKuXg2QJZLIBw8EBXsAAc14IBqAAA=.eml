May 22=2C 2025

Comment: Please elaborate on how you arrived at the conclusion that Russia=
 has already lost the war by virtue of not having won yet. Kinetic activit=
y continues and Russia is making gains =E2=80=93 costly and slowly. Credib=
le=2C non-western media shows that the stated Russian objectives have been=
 (physically=2C not politically) met and Russia has even taken land across=
 the Dnieper River that goes beyond the desired territorial gains stated i=
n the special military operation.

Response: Wars are fought for political and geopolitical reasons and succe=
ss in a war is judged by whether its goals are achieved. Failure to achiev=
e these goals in war means that a nation has lost the war=2C both by faili=
ng to achieve its ends=2C and by the cost of lives and money in the proces=
s. The fact that they retained their sovereignty and their army does not m=
ean that they did not lose the war.  Russia=E2=80=99s geopolitical intenti=
on was to create a substantial buffer zone to protect Russia. The norther=
 border of Ukraine was a few hundred miles from Moscow as the crow flies=
=2C and Ukraine was the historic buffer. The political reason was to demon=
strate internationally and within Russia=2C that the collapse of the Sovie=
t Union did not mean the collapse of Russian power. In failing to conquer=
 all of or a large part and hold only a small part of Ukraine=2C it failed=
 to achieve the strategic depth that Russia needs.

I should add here that the likelihood of a western attack on Russia is ind=
eed slight=2C but that Russian history=2C and that of other countries=2C i=
s filled with misunderstanding that intentions can change rapidly=2C and t=
hat national defense must not assume the constancy of intentions or capabi=
lities. In other words=2C hope for the best and plan for the worst. The am=
ount of land Russia now holds in Ukraine does not create an effective buff=
er zone in spite of the cost of war=2C and therefore Russia failed to achi=
eve its geopolitical goal. Nor did it attain its political goal of demonst=
rating to the world and to Russians that Russia is a militarily powerful n=
ation. That they continue fighting after three years of failing to attain=
 their objectives shows that they still have some power=2C but does not ch=
ange the fact that they failed to achieve their objectives. In the same wa=
y that the US lost in Vietnam=2C they have lost in Ukraine.

I would also like to respond to a reader who would like me not to refer it=
 to as the Vietnam War but as the Southeast Asia war.  It is true that the=
 war was in southeast Asia=2C including Laos and Cambodia. I call it the V=
ietnam war because it is the common and readily recognized name for it. We=
 call World War I and II world wars=2C although neither was waged in much=
 of the world.  So I use Vietnam War as it is the common term.
Comment: Please address Russia=E2=80=99s ability to continue (or not) to c=
ommit resources at the current rate.


Response: Russia cannot continue fighting the war in the way it has=2C not=
 because of resources=2C but because they have failed.  This week Russia h=
as restructured the command of its military forces and found a number of d=
efense related individuals guilty of corruption in securing of supplies. I=
n other words=2C Russian is in the process of restructuring its force=2C s=
eeking to solve two problems. One how the army fights wars=2C second makin=
g the Russian logistic capability=2C the ability to supply troops=2C more=
 effective.

The interesting thing is that the General chosen to lead the army is the o=
ne that as commander of a front=2C was most successful. But the problem wi=
th him is that he fought his battles with massive casualties on his own si=
de. So he is a more aggressive front line general=2C but the cost of victo=
ry under him made exploitation of the victory difficult. The losses can be=
 replaced=2C new operational concepts employed at all levels=2C and suppli=
es delivered where they are needed. But developing new operational princip=
les is easy=2C training the force divisions to brigades to companies=2C in=
 other words from commanding generals to sergeants=2C is more difficult. T=
hey must also restructure logistics. This is not done in a few days=2C but=
 takes months at the most optimistic=2C and if the new land forces command=
er wants to adopt his winning strategy=2C the morale of the troops need to=
 be managed. Plus they must develop and deploy new technologies to match t=
he technologies Ukraine has received from the U.S. that allowed
them to resist.

So the answer is that the Russians have arrived where they are because thi=
s is all their system achieved. For a new system to be introduced needs a=
 long period of relative peace and even then the reforms may not work. I s=
uspect that Putin is hoping for some breathing room but he must not appear=
 to need it. And the Ukrainians and Americans do not want to give them tim=
e. So they want an end to the war=2C and Putin wants to take as long as po=
ssible=2C acting as if he is ready to fight=2C but hoping for enough time=
 holding their front while they restructure their force. Hard to do.
Question: Why could Ukraine continue fighting longer than Russia?

Response: Ukraine has far more to lose that the Russians. Do not underesti=
mate the power of desperation=2C coupled with advanced capabilities provid=
ed by Americans=2C and blooded troops whose operational principles have he=
ld the Russians for over three years where they blocked and reversed the R=
ussian advance. The key for them is the United States and whether it conti=
nues to supply satellite based intelligence=2C weapon systems that take ad=
vantage of it. The question is not only will the Russians effectively chan=
ge how they operate=2C but whether they can introduce new weaponry=2C and=
 train troops to use them.

So under current circumstances the Ukrainians can=2C in general=2C hold on=
=2E And the US wants a peace that can be enforced and Russia wants a breathi=
ng spell. Since that will increase the chance of victory=2C the Ukrainians=
 need the end of the war=2C or to move to the offensive to disrupt the pro=
cess of Russian restructuring. Behind the negotiations=2C I think this is=
 the unspoken issue.
Question: What is Russia=E2=80=99s ability to hold/defend the land its tak=
en?

Response: Russia=E2=80=99s greatest advantage is that the amount of land t=
hey hold is in the final analysis not unbearable to the Ukrainians=2C so u=
nless my prior scenario occurs=2C the reward of forcing the Russians out o=
f the territory they hold is not worth the risk or cost to the Ukrainians.=
 So the issue is less land than time. What the Ukrainians want is to keep=
 Russian troops engaged so they can=E2=80=99t be restructured. Nice in the=
ory=2C but tough in practice.
Question/Comment on troop intervention:
US - Please expand on the feasibility of the US intervening militarily (wi=
th troops). Make sure to address Trump=E2=80=99s political constraints=2C=
 what conditions would be necessary to enable troop intervention and how t=
his would help the US pressure Russia/Ukraine to achieve its goals.

Europe - Please discuss the potential for European military intervention f=
rom the point of view of individual countries and not the region of the wh=
ole. Make sure to address Poland and the Baltics (vs western European coun=
tries) and the possibility of the US to work with a sub-group of specific=
 countries (likely Eastern European) to threaten confrontation or actually=
 intervene against Russia.

Response: I did not forecast U.S. intervention but held it as an option if=
 negotiations fail. It is a credible option given that the United States h=
as intervened military in a range of wars since World War II to achieve ce=
rtain ends while demonstrating American willingness to resist threats. The=
re was the Korean war=2C Vietnam=2C Iraq=2C Afghanistan among the major on=
es=2C and many minor interventions as well. None of these wars directly th=
reatened the United States but they all posed different challenges to the=
 United States that caused the intervention and boosted its credibility=2C=
 demonstrating that the U.S. was prepared to take military action=2C and s=
erved to some extent in forcing other nations to be cautious around the U.=
S.

The willingness of the United States to intervene is a credible threat in=
 a negotiation=2C and even the many failed interventions have served the p=
urpose of establishing the unpredictability of the U.S. when it fears geop=
olitical or political consequences of posing even a long-term threat=2C po=
litical or geopolitical to the United States.  We have already intervened=
 effectively in Ukraine=2C with massive infusions of weapons=2C and pricel=
ess intelligence. These were essential in effective Ukrainian resistance.=
 During a negotiation=2C where Russia feels it can be intransigent=2C the=
 threat of direct military intervention has a credibility in it (even if w=
e have no desire or intention to do so)=2C takes advantage of American his=
torical unpredictability as to where and why it intervenes militarily=2C a=
nd might cause Putin to recalculate the risk-reward relations in his stanc=
e. Having not reached its goals in Ukraine through American support withou=
t troops on the ground=2C the threat and unpredictability of the
U.S. in these matters might shift Putin=E2=80=99s negotiating stance.

As for the European dimension=2C the Europeans have significant military p=
ower=2C particularly in relation to the performance of Russian forces so f=
ar. It should be noted that Germany is deploying a brigade to Lithuania no=
w=2C and that other European powers such as Poland are considering deploym=
ents. Again=2C given Russian performance=2C the European option is there=
=2C and the German deployment in an area near the war zone on a long-term=
 basis with a capable force creates another dimension of threat for Putin=
 to consider.

The Europeans have enough force to cause Russia a significant military cha=
llenge. The issue is that even if they threaten to deploy=2C they do not h=
ave same strength of credibility as a US threat would have. However=2C the=
 German redeployment=2C if not in Ukraine=2C is a signal to the Russians n=
ot to disregard the possibility of European involvement. In war=2C you can=
not base your actions on what is your belief in the other side=E2=80=99s i=
ntention=E2=80=94intentions change and Europe is far form unarmed. For Put=
in to consider if nothing else.
Question: What is the evidence behind the claim that Europeans are unwilli=
ng to put themselves in harm's way to defend their country?  How does this=
 view of Europe reflect your comment in TN100Y about Europe being in an er=
a of decadence?

Response: It is one dimension of that decadence in my view. Nations whose=
 citizens are not prepared to fight to defend their country is the very de=
finition of national decadence. It is of course possible that as Europe co=
mes to terms with the new reality it lives in=2C that the willingness to d=
efend their country will increase. The test will come if a genuine threat=
 to a nation is posed. That is when we can truly measure if they have or h=
ave not become decadent.

Going back to the last question=2C there is no such thing as a Europe exce=
pt as a continent with 44 independent nations=2C with different languages=
=2C cultures and geopolitical realities. Germany has taken a step. France=
 has not. So when we speak of decadence=2C cultures can change dramaticall=
y in the face of a realistic threat. US isolationism collapsed in a day=2C=
 which is part of what we will remember on Monday=2C Memorial Day in the U=
nited States.
Note from me: I have been asked to explain why I use the term =E2=80=9Ceng=
ineering=E2=80=9D in some places. The answer to this is very long and comp=
lex. I will at some point answer and I started to this time. But when I go=
t to page four and was far from finished=2C I decided to try to craft a si=
mpler answer as time permits.  As a hint=2C the term engineering was first=
 used in the late 14^th century and has had many meanings and uses other t=
han the current one. So that=E2=80=99s a hint and all I can do now=E2=80=
=A6

The reason I can=E2=80=99t do it now is because Meredith and I are leaving=
 Monday for a three week visit to Serbia=2C Romania and Hungary. There are=
 things happening in that region now and while you might suspect that ever=
ything I know is what I google=2C I do actually go to the places I discuss=
=2E I will be writing on and about our trip in the next three week=E2=80=99s=
 articles.

Best=2C

<strong>Comment:</strong><em> Please elaborate on how you arrived at the co=
nclusion that Russia has already lost the war by virtue of not having won y=
et. Kinetic activity continues and Russia is making gains =E2=80=93 costly =
and slowly. Credible, non-western media shows that the stated Russian objec=
tives have been (physically, not politically) met and Russia has even taken=
 land across the Dnieper River that goes beyond the desired territorial gai=
ns stated in the special military operation.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Wars are fought for political and geopolitical r=
easons and success in a war is judged by whether its goals are achieved. Fa=
ilure to achieve these goals in war means that a nation has lost the war, b=
oth by failing to achieve its ends, and by the cost of lives and money in t=
he process. The fact that they retained their sovereignty and their army do=
es not mean that they did not lose the war.&nbsp; Russia=E2=80=99s geopolit=
ical intention was to create a substantial buffer zone to protect Russia. T=
he norther border of Ukraine was a few hundred miles from Moscow as the cro=
w flies, and Ukraine was the historic buffer. The political reason was to d=
emonstrate internationally and within Russia, that the collapse of the Sovi=
et Union did not mean the collapse of Russian power.&nbsp;In failing to con=
quer all of or a large part and hold only a small part of Ukraine, it faile=
d to achieve the strategic depth that Russia needs.<br>
<br>
I should add here that the likelihood of a western attack on Russia is inde=
ed slight, but that Russian history, and that of other countries, is filled=
 with misunderstanding that intentions can change rapidly, and that nationa=
l defense must not assume the constancy of intentions or capabilities.&nbsp=
;In other words, hope for the best and plan for the worst. The amount of la=
nd Russia now holds in Ukraine does not create an effective buffer zone in =
spite of the cost of war, and therefore Russia failed to achieve its geopol=
itical goal.&nbsp;Nor did it attain its political goal of demonstrating to =
the world and to Russians that Russia is a militarily powerful nation.&nbsp=
;That they continue fighting after three years of failing to attain their o=
bjectives shows that they still have some power, but does not change the fa=
ct that they failed to achieve their objectives. In the same way that the U=
S lost in Vietnam, they have lost in Ukraine.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I would also like to respond to a reader who would like me not to refer it =
to as the Vietnam War but as the Southeast Asia war.&nbsp; It is true that =
the war was in southeast Asia, including Laos and Cambodia. I call it the V=
ietnam war because it is the common and readily recognized name for it. We =
call World War I&nbsp;and II world wars, although neither was waged in much=

                            <strong>Comment: </strong><em>Please address Ru=
ssia=E2=80=99s ability to continue (or not) to commit resources at the curr=
ent rate.</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Russia cannot continue fighting the war in the w=
ay it has, not because of resources, but because they have failed.&nbsp; Th=
is week Russia has restructured the command of its military forces and foun=
d a number of defense related individuals guilty of corruption in securing =
of supplies. In other words, Russian is in the process of restructuring its=
 force, seeking to solve two problems. One how the army fights wars, second=
 making the Russian logistic capability, the ability to supply troops, more=
 effective.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is that the General chosen to lead the army is the on=
e that as commander of a front, was most successful. But the problem with h=
im is that he fought his battles with massive casualties on his own side. S=
o he is a more aggressive front line general, but the cost of victory under=
 him made exploitation of the victory difficult. The losses can be replaced=
, new operational concepts employed at all levels, and supplies delivered w=
here they are needed. But developing new operational principles is easy, tr=
aining the force divisions to brigades to companies, in other words from co=
mmanding generals to sergeants, is more difficult. They must also restructu=
re logistics. This is not done in a few days, but takes months at the most =
optimistic, and if the new land forces commander wants to adopt his winning=
 strategy, the morale of the troops need to be managed. Plus they must deve=
lop and deploy new technologies to match the technologies Ukraine has recei=
ved from the U.S. that allowed them to resist.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So the answer is that the Russians have arrived where they are because this=
 is all their system achieved. For a new system to be introduced needs a lo=
ng period of relative peace and even then the reforms may not work. I suspe=
ct that Putin is hoping for some breathing room but he must not appear to n=
eed it. And the Ukrainians and Americans do not want to give them time. So =
they want an end to the war, and Putin wants to take as long as possible, a=
cting as if he is ready to fight, but hoping for enough time holding their =
front while they restructure their force. Hard to do.

                            <div><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Why could U=
kraine continue fighting longer than Russia?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Ukraine has far more to lose that the Russians. =
Do not underestimate the power of desperation, coupled with advanced capabi=
lities provided by Americans, and blooded troops whose operational principl=
es have held the Russians for over three years where they blocked and rever=
sed the Russian advance. The key for them is the United States and whether =
it continues to supply satellite based intelligence, weapon systems that ta=
ke advantage of it. The question is not only will the Russians effectively =
change how they operate, but whether they can introduce new weaponry, and t=
rain troops to use them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So under current circumstances the Ukrainians can, in general, hold on. And=
 the US wants a peace that can be enforced&nbsp;and Russia wants a breathin=
g spell.&nbsp;Since that will increase the chance of victory, the Ukrainian=
s need the end of the war, or to move to the offensive to disrupt the proce=
ss of Russian restructuring.&nbsp;Behind the negotiations, I think this is =
the unspoken issue.</div>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Russia=E2=80=99s greatest advantage is that the =
amount of land they hold is in the final analysis not unbearable to the Ukr=
ainians, so unless my prior scenario occurs, the reward of forcing the Russ=
ians out of the territory they hold is not worth the risk or cost to the Uk=
rainians.&nbsp;So the issue is less land than time. What the Ukrainians wan=
t is to keep Russian troops engaged so they can=E2=80=99t be restructured. =
Nice in theory, but tough in practice.</div>

                            <div><strong>Question/Comment on troop interven=
tion:</strong><br>
<em><strong>US - </strong>Please expand on the feasibility of the US interv=
ening militarily (with troops). Make sure to address Trump=E2=80=99s politi=
cal constraints, what conditions would be necessary to enable troop interve=
ntion and how this would help the US pressure Russia/Ukraine to achieve its=
 goals.</em><br>
&nbsp;
<div><em><strong>Europe - </strong>Please discuss the potential for Europea=
n military intervention from the point of view of individual countries and =
not the region of the whole. Make sure to address Poland and the Baltics (v=
s western European countries) and the possibility of the US to work with a =
sub-group of specific countries (likely Eastern European) to threaten confr=
ontation or actually intervene against Russia.</em></div>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>I did not forecast U.S. intervention but he=
ld it as an option if negotiations fail. It is a credible option given that=
 the United States has intervened military in a range of wars since World W=
ar II to achieve certain ends while demonstrating American willingness to r=
esist threats. There was the Korean war, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan among t=
he major ones, and many minor interventions as well. None of these wars dir=
ectly threatened the United States but they all posed different challenges =
to the United States that caused the intervention and boosted its credibili=
ty, demonstrating that the U.S. was prepared to take military action, and s=
erved to some extent in forcing other nations to be cautious around the U.S=
.<br>
<br>
The willingness of the United States to intervene is a credible threat in a=
 negotiation, and even the many failed interventions have served the purpos=
e of establishing the unpredictability of the U.S. when it fears geopolitic=
al or political consequences of posing even a long-term threat, political o=
r geopolitical to the United States.&nbsp; We have already intervened effec=
tively in Ukraine, with massive infusions of weapons, and priceless intelli=
gence. These were essential in effective Ukrainian resistance. During a neg=
otiation, where Russia feels it can be intransigent, the threat of direct m=
ilitary intervention has a credibility in it (even if we have no desire or =
intention to do so), takes advantage of American historical unpredictabilit=
y as to where and why it intervenes militarily, and might cause Putin to re=
calculate the risk-reward relations in his stance. Having not reached its g=
oals in Ukraine through American support without troops on the ground, the =
threat and unpredictability of the U.S. in these matters might shift Putin=
=E2=80=99s negotiating stance.<br>
&nbsp;
<div>As for the European dimension, the Europeans have significant military=
 power, particularly in relation to the performance of Russian forces so fa=
r.&nbsp;It should be noted that Germany is deploying a brigade to Lithuania=
 now, and that other European powers such as Poland are considering deploym=
ents.&nbsp;Again, given Russian performance, the European option is there, =
and the German deployment in an area near the war zone on a long-term basis=
 with a capable force creates another dimension of threat for Putin to cons=
ider.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Europeans have enough force to cause Russia a significant military chal=
lenge.&nbsp;The issue is that even if they threaten to deploy, they do not =
have same strength of credibility as a US threat would have. However, the G=
erman redeployment, if not in Ukraine, is a signal to the Russians not to d=
isregard the possibility of European involvement. In war, you cannot base y=
our actions on what is your belief in the other side=E2=80=99s intention=E2=
=80=94intentions change and Europe is far form unarmed. For Putin to consid=
er if nothing else.</div>

                            <div><strong>Question:</strong> <em>What is the=
 evidence behind the claim that Europeans are unwilling to put themselves i=
n harm's way to defend their country?&nbsp; How does this view of Europe re=
flect your comment in TN100Y about Europe being in an era of decadence?</em=
><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>It is one dimension of that decadence in my view=
. Nations whose citizens are not prepared to fight to defend their country =
is the very definition of national decadence. It is of course possible that=
 as Europe comes to terms with the new reality it lives in, that the willin=
gness to defend their country will increase. The test will come if a genuin=
e threat to a nation is posed. That is when we can truly measure if they ha=
ve or have not become decadent.<br>
<br>
Going back to the last question, there is no such thing as a Europe except =
as a continent with 44 independent nations, with different languages, cultu=
res and geopolitical realities.&nbsp;Germany has taken a step.&nbsp;France =
has not.&nbsp;So when we speak of decadence, cultures can change dramatical=
ly in the face of a realistic threat. US isolationism collapsed in a day, w=
hich is part of what we will remember on Monday, Memorial Day in the United=
 States.</div>
