On Drumming: The Psychology and Philosophy of Improvisation (https://a.co/=
d/hUVCwgm?mc_cid=3D1e9843161d&mc_eid=3DUNIQID)

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m determined not to lose any readers in this section. B=
e warned: we are going to talk about music and spirituality=2C but we are=
 going to do it without LSD=2C candles=2C or music festival tickets. We=E2=
=80=99ll use the same analytical eye we=E2=80=99ve used for this whole boo=
k. You can get as hippy-dippy or not with me in this section=2C but the po=
int is that we absolutely cannot talk about the benefits of playing drums=
=E2=80=94the most ancient and common instrument in spiritual practices sin=
ce the beginning of human history=E2=80=94without noticing this apparent p=
ower. For all time=2C in every corner of the world=2C people have experien=
ced strikingly similar transformative experiences through music making. In=
 tribal cultures=2C music=2C and specifically drumming=2C is a common feat=
ure of consciousness-altering spiritual ceremonies. To play the drums your=
 whole life without taking stock of this is to miss something important. M=
usic plays a role in every spiritual practice and can be a part of your sp=
iritual life regardless of your
beliefs.

It=E2=80=99s hard to deny that there is something intangible and mystical-=
feeling about music=2C but this can be explained by understanding some way=
s that music is unique from other art forms. First=2C let=E2=80=99s focus=
 on music without lyrics. To start by stating what seems obvious=2C this t=
ype of music does not rely on language or visual stimuli. Every other art=
 form does. The reason this is significant is that language and vision are=
 the primary tools we use to make sense of our everyday experience. Every=
 moment we are awake=2C we automatically=2C pre-consciously process the wo=
rld with language and vision=2C reflexively categorizing and associating o=
bjects and ideas. We receive and communicate ideas using language. Even ou=
r thinking=E2=80=94our inner dialogue=E2=80=94functions largely through la=
nguage. Language and vision help us keep track of things by making them in=
to =E2=80=9Citems=E2=80=9D in our minds.

Though sound is obviously a part of most waking experiences=2C it is only=
 in the realm of music where it is detached from language and vision and m=
ade the sole substance of the experience. Poetry=2C literature=2C theater=
=2C and film=2C which can evoke emotions as strong or stronger than music=
=2C do so to a significant degree with language and narrative. Even when l=
anguage is being used in a way that is abstract and metaphorical=2C the em=
otions you feel remain to some degree attached to real world things and id=
eas. When we see someone on the stage=2C screen=2C or page suffering=2C we=
 can identify the source of our emotion narratively and explain with words=
 the connection. In short=2C we have words for that.

On the other hand=2C when a series of musical notes passes=2C they refer t=
o=E2=80=A6nothing. They do not activate a web of language and they do not=
 refer directly to any object or idea in the world. In short=2C we do not=
 have words for that. They exist in themselves as an auditory experience.=
 This in itself isn=E2=80=99t good or bad=2C but the remarkable thing abou=
t those passing musical notes is that=2C despite the fact that they refer=
 to
nothing in a literal sense=2C they can evoke powerful emotions. They still=
 mean something to us even though they evade our tools of description.

This is one reason music might be so universally attractive. Psychological=
ly=2C by not using words=2C music bypasses the reasoning parts of the brai=
n that think with language=2C but still =E2=80=9Ccommunicates=E2=80=9D wit=
h subconscious parts of the brain that are involved with pleasure=2C love=
=2C compassion=2C and empathy. Its ability to evoke emotions without the o=
bjects and narratives of the real world gives us the opportunity to =E2=80=
=9Cplay=E2=80=9D in the realm of pure emotion. This means that we can expe=
rience the =E2=80=9Cessence=E2=80=9D of an emotion without the consequence=
s that typically accompany it in real life. This might be why it feels goo=
d to listen to sad music. Anyone who has had a good cry knows the catharsi=
s caused even by =E2=80=9Cnegative=E2=80=9D emotions. Music gives us some=
 of that catharsis even when we aren=E2=80=99t going through a hard (or go=
od) time=2C which means that the raw sensation in your body that we call s=
adness maybe isn=E2=80=99t inherently negative at all. It just tends to oc=
cur when unfortunate things are happening to us.

Since our typical experience of the world is through language and vision=
=2C this helps us understand why music can feel =E2=80=9Cotherworldly.=E2=
=80=9D The Oxford Dictionary definition of mystery is: =E2=80=9Csomething=
 that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain.=E2=80=9D Part o=
f why music is nearly ubiquitous in spiritual practices is because it is a=
mong the experiences that evade our standard tools of explanation. It ther=
efore feels mystical=2C aka=2C filled with mystery.

Does adding lyrics negate this unique quality in music? In most cases=2C n=
o. Good lyrics enhance the emotional power of music without reducing its a=
bstract nature too much. This is why most people feel that good lyrics are=
 somewhat ambiguous or abstract=E2=80=94less like literature and more like=
 poetry=2C where the point is more to evoke feelings that may have little=
 to do with the literal words than it is to recount a series of events. Fu=
rthermore=2C it is telling that the emotional content of the lyrics tends=
 to be overpowered by the emotion of the accompanying music because the mu=
sic and even the melody of the vocals communicates directly with those sub=
conscious=2C emotional parts of your brain. Happy lyrics sung over sad mus=
ic will be felt as sad=2C not happy. In this way=2C from an emotional pers=
pective=2C lyrics are accompaniment to the music=2C though we tend to thin=
k of it the other way around.

This framing helps us think about the unique pull of music in a way that e=
ven the spiritual skeptic won=E2=80=99t roll their eyes at. Everything we=
 just said=2C after all=2C simply describes the basic psychology that we a=
ll share when we listen to music. So=2C the step we just took is to simply=
 notice that our hobby deals with something experientially unique and poss=
ibly profound. When we combine this intangible aspect of music with what w=
e know from previous chapters about building layers of automation that ena=
ble us to improvise=2C it primes us to have one of the most seemingly myst=
ical experiences the drums can offer.=E2=80=9D


=E2=80=9CI never imagined that a book about drum improvisation could be ap=
plicable to so many areas of life. JP Bouvet wrote not just a book for dru=
mmers=2C but for anyone striving to achieve fluency and creativity in thei=
r lives - something rare these days=2C when so many simply copy and repeat=
 what they see online. JP is not only a brilliant musician and educator bu=
t also an inspiration for anyone seeking authenticity in their lives. Brav=
o!=E2=80=9D

ion. Be warned: we are going to talk about music and spirituality, but we a=
re going to do it without LSD, candles, or music festival tickets. We=E2=80=
=99ll use the same analytical eye we=E2=80=99ve used for this whole book. Y=
ou can get as hippy-dippy or not with me in this section, but the point is =
that we absolutely cannot talk about the benefits of playing drums=E2=80=94=
the most ancient and common instrument in spiritual practices since the beg=
inning of human history=E2=80=94without noticing this apparent power. For a=
ll time, in every corner of the world, people have experienced strikingly s=
imilar transformative experiences through music making. In tribal cultures,=
 music, and specifically drumming, is a common feature of consciousness-alt=
ering spiritual ceremonies. To play the drums your whole life without takin=
g stock of this is to miss something important. Music plays a role in every=
 spiritual practice and can be a part of your spiritual life regardless of =
your beliefs.</p><p><br></p><p>It=E2=80=99s hard to deny that there is some=
thing intangible and mystical-feeling about music, but this can be explaine=
d by understanding some ways that music is unique from other art forms. Fir=
st, let=E2=80=99s focus on music without lyrics. To start by stating what s=
eems obvious, this type of music does not rely on language or visual stimul=
i. Every other art form does. The reason this is significant is that langua=
ge and vision are the primary tools we use to make sense of our everyday ex=
perience. Every moment we are awake, we automatically, pre-consciously proc=
ess the world with language and vision, reflexively categorizing and associ=
ating objects and ideas. We receive and communicate ideas using language. E=
ven our thinking=E2=80=94our inner dialogue=E2=80=94functions largely throu=
gh language. Language and vision help us keep track of things by making the=
m into =E2=80=9Citems=E2=80=9D in our minds. </p><p><br></p><p>Though sound=
 is obviously a part of most waking experiences, it is only in the realm of=
 music where it is detached from language and vision and made the sole subs=
tance of the experience. Poetry, literature, theater, and film, which can e=
voke emotions as strong or stronger than music, do so to a significant degr=
ee with language and narrative. Even when language is being used in a way t=
hat is abstract and metaphorical, the emotions you feel remain to some degr=
ee attached to real world things and ideas. When we see someone on the stag=
e, screen, or page suffering, we can identify the source of our emotion nar=
ratively and explain with words the connection. In short, we have words for=
 that. </p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, when a series of musical notes =
passes, they refer to=E2=80=A6nothing. They do not activate a web of langua=
ge and they do not refer directly to any object or idea in the world. In sh=
ort, we do not have words for that. They exist in themselves as an auditory=
 experience. This in itself isn=E2=80=99t good or bad, but the remarkable t=
hing about those passing musical notes is that, despite the fact that they =
refer to <br>nothing in a literal sense, they can evoke powerful emotions. =
They still mean something to us even though they evade our tools of descrip=
tion.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one reason music might be so universally att=
ractive. Psychologically, by not using words, music bypasses the reasoning =
parts of the brain that think with language, but still =E2=80=9Ccommunicate=
s=E2=80=9D with subconscious parts of the brain that are involved with plea=
sure, love, compassion, and empathy. Its ability to evoke emotions without =
the objects and narratives of the real world gives us the opportunity to =
=E2=80=9Cplay=E2=80=9D in the realm of pure emotion. This means that we can=
 experience the =E2=80=9Cessence=E2=80=9D of an emotion without the consequ=
ences that typically accompany it in real life. This might be why it feels =
good to listen to sad music. Anyone who has had a good cry knows the cathar=
sis caused even by =E2=80=9Cnegative=E2=80=9D emotions. Music gives us some=
 of that catharsis even when we aren=E2=80=99t going through a hard (or goo=
d) time, which means that the raw sensation in your body that we call sadne=
ss maybe isn=E2=80=99t inherently negative at all. It just tends to occur w=
hen unfortunate things are happening to us. </p><p><br></p><p>Since our typ=
ical experience of the world is through language and vision, this helps us =
understand why music can feel =E2=80=9Cotherworldly.=E2=80=9D The Oxford Di=
ctionary definition of mystery is: =E2=80=9Csomething that is difficult or =
impossible to understand or explain.=E2=80=9D Part of why music is nearly u=
biquitous in spiritual practices is because it is among the experiences tha=
t evade our standard tools of explanation. It therefore feels mystical, aka=
, filled with mystery. </p><p><br></p><p>Does adding lyrics negate this uni=
que quality in music? In most cases, no. Good lyrics enhance the emotional =
power of music without reducing its abstract nature too much. This is why m=
ost people feel that good lyrics are somewhat ambiguous or abstract=E2=80=
=94less like literature and more like poetry, where the point is more to ev=
oke feelings that may have little to do with the literal words than it is t=
o recount a series of events. Furthermore, it is telling that the emotional=
 content of the lyrics tends to be overpowered by the emotion of the accomp=
anying music because the music and even the melody of the vocals communicat=
es directly with those subconscious, emotional parts of your brain. Happy l=
yrics sung over sad music will be felt as sad, not happy. In this way, from=
 an emotional perspective, lyrics are accompaniment to the music, though we=
 tend to think of it the other way around. </p><p><br></p><p>This framing h=
elps us think about the unique pull of music in a way that even the spiritu=
al skeptic won=E2=80=99t roll their eyes at. Everything we just said, after=
 all, simply describes the basic psychology that we all share when we liste=
n to music. So, the step we just took is to simply notice that our hobby de=
als with something experientially unique and possibly profound. When we com=
bine this intangible aspect of music with what we know from previous chapte=
rs about building layers of automation that enable us to improvise, it prim=
es us to have one of the most seemingly mystical experiences the drums can =
offer.=E2=80=9D </p><p class=3D"last-child"><br></p></div></td></tr></tbody=
