Today, with insights from over 8,200 of you (thank you to everyone who part=
icipated!), we=E2=80=99re excited to share the results of our first-ever la=
rge-scale tech worker sentiment survey.
It=E2=80=99s hard to imagine a more intense time to be working in technolog=
y, so Noam and I wanted to capture a rich picture of tech workers=E2=80=99 =
sentiment=E2=80=94at this moment, and going forward.
Our analysis examines several dimensions of tech worker sentiment, includin=
g career outlook, role satisfaction, burnout, quitting intentions, career p=
ath clarity, leadership effectiveness, work setup preferences, and more.
What we discovered is that tech professionals are experiencing a fascinatin=
g mix of emotions about their careers in 2025.

Our biggest takeaways
Burnout is at critical levels: Almost half of our respondents are experienc=
ing significant burnout.
Tech workers are more optimistic than we expected=E2=80=94but optimism is d=
eclining: 58.5% of tech workers remain optimistic about their roles, and 54=
=2E8% remain optimistic about their car=
eers. However, there has been a signif=
icant negative sentiment shift over the past year.
Startup founders are the happiest people in tech: They=E2=80=99re the only =
group growing more optimistic while consistently outranking everyone else i=
n workplace well-being.
Managers need help: Only 26% of tech workers consider their managers highly=
 effective, while over 40% view them as ineffective.
Where people work makes little difference in how they feel about work=E2=80=
=94on the surface. But dig deeper, and hybrid workers are the happiest, rem=
ote workers are doing well, and in-office workers are experiencing hidden f=
rustrations.
Small-company employees are doing the best: They outperform their large-com=
pany counterparts on nearly every work sentiment measure, from job enjoymen=
t to sense of belonging.
The mid-career slump: Mid-career workers are struggling the most with burno=
ut, lower job enjoyment, and the most pessimism about the future.
A widespread gap in career clarity: Many tech workers don=E2=80=99t know wh=
at they should be doing to continue developing in their careers.
How we ran the survey and who responded
We started by asking about people=E2=80=99s optimism (or pessimism) regardi=
ng the future of their role and career. We also asked people to reflect on =
the past year in tech and how their feelings had changed.
We then dug into people=E2=80=99s work experiences, including enjoyment, bu=
rnout, quitting intentions, career development thoughts, and manager effect=
iveness.
Finally, we explored how people feel about their work environments, how eng=
aged they are at work, and how much belonging they feel in their organizati=
on.
Takeaway 1: Burnout is a critical issue facing the tech workforce
44.67% of all respondents are currently experiencing significant burnout (m=
eaning they said they=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9Cmoderately,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cver=
y,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ccompletely=E2=80=9D burned-out).
Burnout doesn=E2=80=99t just affect tech workers=E2=80=99 experience in the=
ir current job=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s also correlated with people=E2=80=99s o=
ptimism or pessimism about the future of their career. 60% of extremely pes=
simistic respondents reported high burnout. Only 8% of extremely optimistic=
 respondents reported that they=E2=80=99re highly burned-out.
Interestingly, workers at smaller companies report significantly lower burn=
out levels than those at larger companies. However, there=E2=80=99s a drama=
tic spike in burnout within midsize companies (500 to 1,000 employees), per=
haps because they=E2=80=99re large enough to have corporate bureaucracy but=
 not large enough to have well-developed employee support systems.
Full-time employees experience nearly twice the burnout rate of self-employ=
ed workers and contractors. More autonomy and control over work arrangement=
s equals significantly lower burnout rates.
Hardware is indeed hard. Tech workers in hardware and infra roles show the =
highest burnout rates, whereas people are (moderately) less burned-out work=
ing on emerging technology (e.g. AI) and specialized sectors (e.g. fintech,=
 healthtech).
Burnout varies by role, and there's a clear split - founders and engineers =
are dealing with way less burnout compared to everyone else.
Not surprisingly, there=E2=80=99s a clear business impact of burnout:
Burnout strongly correlates with quitting intentions=E2=80=9467.8% of worke=
rs who are actively exploring new opportunities or considering quitting are=
 highly burned-out.
Burnout also strongly correlates with worker engagement. High burnout domin=
ates among workers with low engagement, with close to 30% (!) of not-engage=
d workers saying they=E2=80=99re completely burned-out.
Takeaway 2: Tech workers are more optimistic than we expected=E2=80=94but o=
ptimism is declining
We asked tech workers how optimistic or pessimistic they are about:
The future of their career
The future of their job function, in light of the rise of AI
Broadly speaking, tech professionals maintain a positive outlook, with 54.8=
% expressing optimistic career sentiments, versus 33.3% expressing pessimis=
tic views. Job function sentiment is even rosier, with 58.5% reporting opti=
mistic feelings and only 25.1% pessimism about their specific role. In both=
 cases, the rest of the respondents selected =E2=80=9Cneutral.=E2=80=9D
We were curious to understand how each respondent views the future of their=
 career compared with the future of their role. So we dug deeper into the c=
omparison between current roles vs. long-term career prospects:
45.2% of respondents have aligned career and role sentiment, meaning they=
=E2=80=99re equally optimistic (or pessimistic) about their career and spec=
ific role.
32.0% are more optimistic about their current role than their overall caree=
r.
22.8% are more optimistic about their career than their current role.
This means that while many tech workers feel good about their immediate job=
 situation, they have more concerns about long-term industry trends and car=
eer progression.
But optimism seems to be declining. We asked tech workers how their feeling=
s have changed over the past year, and there=E2=80=99s been a significant n=
egative shift in sentiment:
This could be due to the economic climate, the rise of AI, or other factors=
 we=E2=80=99re still investigating.
Only two segments have become more optimistic over the past year: founders =
and new college grads.
Conversely, designers and researchers had the largest negative sentiment ch=
ange. Employees at large companies feel more pessimistic, as do fully remot=
e workers.
Takeaway 3: Startup founders are the happiest people in tech
One of the most striking patterns is that founders have the most positive s=
entiments across nearly all metrics compared with other tech roles:
The highest career optimism
The highest job function optimism
More optimism compared with last year (which means they=E2=80=99re way more=
 optimistic about the future than everyone else in this sample)
The highest job enjoyment
The lowest burnout levels
Perhaps less surprisingly, founders are the most committed to their roles, =
with the lowest quitting intentions
Finally, founders feel much more engaged and have a significantly stronger =
sense of belonging than all other roles
This remarkable pattern suggests that ownership, autonomy, and purpose are =
potent drivers of work satisfaction and well-being.
Takeaway 4: Managers need help
Fewer than 1 in 3 tech workers (26.6%) rate their managers as highly effect=
ive, while more than 4 in 10 (42.3%) rate their managers as ineffective.
But the mind-boggling insights are the correlations (which don=E2=80=99t im=
ply causation!) between direct-manager effectiveness and worker sentiment.
Leadership impacts virtually all worker sentiment dimensions. For most sent=
iment metrics, there=E2=80=99s a massive gap between those who rated their =
managers as ineffective and those who rated them as extremely effective.
People with great managers are 48% more engaged than those with poor manage=
rs.
People with great managers also feel 63% (!) more belonging, 31% less burno=
ut, and 62% (!!!) more job enjoyment compared to those with ineffective man=
agers.
Retention is also deeply impacted by manager ratings:
Workers with ineffective leadership are 4.3 times as likely to be at risk o=
f leaving (72.6% vs. 16.9%).
Workers with extremely effective leadership are 8.2 times as likely to be c=
ommitted to their role (61.6% vs. 7.5%).
The most dramatic difference is in workers =E2=80=9Cactively looking=E2=80=
=9D for new opportunities, who are 5 times as likely to rate their manager =
poorly.
Leadership quality may be the single most important lever for retention. It=
=E2=80=99s tied to substantial increases in engagement, belonging, and enjo=
yment, and notable decreases in burnout.
Interestingly, remote leadership was rated slightly more effective than in-=
office leadership, challenging assumptions about remote management challeng=
es.
Leadership effectiveness ratings gradually decline as company size increase=
s, with small companies showing modestly better leadership perception than =
large enterprises.
People in product and design roles have the most negative leadership percep=
tions.
The leadership effectiveness gap represents a major opportunity. With only =
26.6% of workers rating their manager as highly effective, improving leader=
ship quality represents one of the highest-leverage investments organizatio=
ns can make.
Takeaway 5: Hybrid workers feel better about their job; in-office workers f=
eel better about their career
Over 50% of tech workers in this sample are primarily working remotely (37.=
7% fully remote, 16.9% mostly remote). Only about 5% of respondents are in =
an office every day (a ratio that=E2=80=99s in line with current industry d=
ata).
At first glance, the data seemed to suggest that tech workers are feeling j=
ust about the same, no matter where they work:
Job enjoyment is the same for everyone. Apparently, on-site restaurants, fr=
ee dry-cleaning, and video games don=E2=80=99t drive higher job enjoyment.
Burnout is also the same across work setups. Remote workers aren=E2=80=99t =
experiencing more burnout because they are physically separated from their =
teams.
Work setup isn=E2=80=99t related to quitting intentions.
Engagement levels are remarkably consistent across work arrangements. Tech =
workers=E2=80=99 interest, involvement, and connection to their work aren=
=E2=80=99t related to where they do it.
And contrary to common assumptions, remote workers feel just as much belong=
ing as in-office workers do.
But when we dove deeper, we revealed some unexpected patterns:
We asked respondents directly how their work setup has impacted their feeli=
ngs about their job. People working hybrid (mostly from home) felt much bet=
ter about their job than those who work in-office, a 21% difference in sent=
iment.
However, when it comes to feelings about the future:
In-office workers were slightly more optimistic about the future of their c=
areer compared with fully remote or even hybrid workers.
In-office workers were also slightly more optimistic about the future of th=
eir job function in light of the rise of AI.
In other words, hybrid workers are feeling a lot better about their job, bu=
t in-office workers feel better about their career prospects.
What this all means:
Hybrid workers are the happiest, but remote workers are surprisingly happy =
as well. These findings challenge the standard narrative that in-office wor=
k inherently creates stronger engagement, belonging, or job enjoyment.
In-office workers are doing OK on the surface, but when asked directly, the=
y share struggles that are likely to manifest later on.
Flexible work arrangements that prioritize remote work with some in-person =
interaction may provide the optimal balance for most tech workers.
It=E2=80=99s also important to note that several confounding variables may =
be in play regarding work location. Age, company size, and role distributio=
n are all related to work setup. It=E2=80=99s possible that some difference=
s are due to those factors rather than the work location itself. For exampl=
e, remote workers skew older (45.1% ages 35 to 44, vs. 30.8% for in-office)=
=2E Or hybrid arrangements are more com=
mon in larger companies (30% at 1-to-5=
0-employee companies, compared with 46.6% at 1,000-plus-employee companies)=
=2E
Takeaway 6: Small-company employees are doing the best
Company size emerges as one of the strongest predictors of positive sentime=
nt, with statistically significant differences across organization sizes fo=
r 9 out of 11 sentiment metrics.
People in smaller companies are:
More optimistic about their career
More satisfied in their role
Experiencing less-pronounced negative sentiment change
Enjoying their job more
Less burned-out
Less eager to quit
Rating their managers more highly
More engaged
And we saved the strongest correlation for last: They feel more belonging.
These findings reinforce the importance of creating tight-knit teams and sm=
aller communities within large organizations.
Big companies must foster a sense of connection and purpose that=E2=80=99s =
clearly lost when they grow beyond their first 50 to 100 employees.
Takeaway 7: The mid-career slump is real
Career optimism declines with experience, and the decline is substantial, w=
ith early-career workers scoring 15% higher than their later-career counter=
parts.
But across multiple other sentiment variables, we observed a U-shaped patte=
rn with age and experience:
Early-career professionals (0 to 6 years) generally report high optimism (a=
bout 62% optimistic), low burnout (47% not or only slightly burned-out), an=
d high job enjoyment (71% enjoying their work).
Mid-career professionals (7 to 14 years) report the most negative sentiment=
 patterns, with higher burnout (41% not or only slightly burned-out), highe=
r quitting intentions (28% committed to their roles), and lower job enjoyme=
nt (66% enjoying their work).
Late-career professionals (15-plus years) report higher job enjoyment (75% =
enjoying their work) and lower quitting intentions (34% committed to their =
roles) than mid-career professionals.
Engagement and belonging remain fairly consistent from early to mid-career =
stages. Late-career professionals report the highest levels of engagement a=
nd belonging, and also enjoyment, clarity, and commitment. Apparently, if y=
ou make it through the mid-career slump and find your niche, you become mor=
e content compared with earlier-career workers.
This pattern suggests that organizations should pay special attention to mi=
d-career professionals, who may be experiencing a =E2=80=9Ccareer crisis=E2=
=80=9D when early enthusiasm has waned but long-term career resilience and =
clarity haven=E2=80=99t yet developed.
Takeaway 8: There=E2=80=99s a widespread gap in career clarity
We asked tech workers how clear they are about the skills and career develo=
pment paths they should pursue to reach their professional goals. What we f=
ound is widespread uncertainty:
Career clarity was strongly related to our other key sentiment metrics, par=
ticularly engagement and leadership perception. It=E2=80=99s hard to be an =
engaged worker when you=E2=80=99re not sure what to engage in. And managers=
 play a critical role in setting expectations and guiding workers along the=
ir career path to secure their future.
This uncertainty around career development likely contributes to career anx=
iety and the negative shifts in future outlook we=E2=80=99ve observed, and =
it may partly explain the high percentage of professionals considering quit=
ting (about 40%).
Bonus takeaway #1: Women are more burned-out (but more engaged) than men
In this sample, more women reported being burned-out=E2=80=94or burned-out =
to a greater degree=E2=80=94than the male respondents did. We=E2=80=99re no=
t talking about massive gaps but, rather, consistent patterns that show up =
across large samples:
Women=E2=80=99s burnout scores are roughly 3% higher than men=E2=80=99s.
Women=E2=80=99s role and career optimism are about 3.3% lower.
Women also reported slightly lower enjoyment and more negative emotional im=
pacts from their work setup.
Now, these might seem like small differences (and statistically speaking, t=
hey are small effect sizes), but they=E2=80=99re significant. Small sentime=
nt gaps can have outsized impacts on retention and performance over time.
But interestingly, women respondents said that they=E2=80=99re also more en=
gaged and have a stronger sense of belonging than the men we studied.
What does this tell us? Women in tech are feeling more connected and commit=
ted to their work (and work communities), while simultaneously feeling more=
 strained and less optimistic about their future in the industry. The diffe=
rences may be small, but it=E2=80=99s important to be mindful of trends lik=
e these that can hurt women=E2=80=99s equity and inclusion in the industry.
Bonus takeaway #2: AI is keeping tech workers up at night...

and statistically speaking, they are small effect sizes), but they=E2=80=99=

 and performance over time.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

us? Women in tech are feeling more connected and committed to their work (a=
