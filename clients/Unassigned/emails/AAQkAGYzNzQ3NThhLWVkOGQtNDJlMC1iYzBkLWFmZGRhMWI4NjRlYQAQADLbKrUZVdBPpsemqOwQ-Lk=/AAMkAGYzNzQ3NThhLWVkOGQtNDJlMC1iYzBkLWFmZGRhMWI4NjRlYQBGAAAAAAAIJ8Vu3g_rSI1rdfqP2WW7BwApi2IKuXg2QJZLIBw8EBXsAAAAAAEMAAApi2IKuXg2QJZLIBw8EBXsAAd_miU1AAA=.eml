You asked for everything I know about prompting in one place: here it is!
Over the past year, I've written dozens of posts about prompt engineering=
=E2=80=94deep dives into specific techniques, comparisons of different AI m=
odels, advanced strategies for complex tasks. And consistently, week after =
week, I get the same request in my inbox:
"Nate, can you just summarize everything you know about prompting in one cl=
ear post? Something I can bookmark and actually follow along with?"
The request usually comes with a qualifier: Some readers are complete begin=
ners who feel overwhelmed by scattered tips and tricks. Others are already =
getting good results but know they're missing something. And many of you ar=
e somewhere in between=E2=80=94you've had both brilliant successes and baff=
ling failures with AI, and you want to understand why.
So this is that post. Everything I've learned about prompt engineering, org=
anized from the absolute basics to advanced techniques, all in one place. I=
f you've never written a prompt before, you can start at the beginning and =
work your way through. If you're already comfortable with AI, you can jump =
to the sections that fill your gaps. And if you're looking for that one def=
initive guide to share with your team or bookmark for reference=E2=80=94thi=
s is it.
I've structured this to be both a tutorial and a reference guide. Read it s=
traight through to build your skills systematically, or jump to specific se=
ctions when you need them. Either way, you'll have everything you need to t=
urn AI from a frustrating puzzle into a reliable tool that actually saves y=
ou time.
I=E2=80=99ve structured this around three key pieces:
The Beginner=E2=80=99s Handy Guide: An introductory post in the substack th=
at lays out how to get started and introduces my two longer guides (below)
The Complete Beginner=E2=80=99s Guide: An in-depth guide to prompting aimed=
 specifically at beginners, updated for 2025!
The A-to-Z Prompt Engineering Guide: A desk reference guide to prompting, i=
ncluding dozens of pages on advanced prompting techniques, including team-l=
evel insights

OTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
This beginner's guide to prompt engineering teaches you how to communicate =
effectively with AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini by crafting cl=
ear, specific instructions (prompts) that get you the results you want. The=
 guide explains that AI doesn't actually "think" or understand implied mean=
ing=E2=80=94it recognizes patterns and predicts responses based on exactly =
what you write=E2=80=94so being precise matters more than being clever or l=
engthy.=20
You'll learn practical techniques ranging from the CLEAR framework (Context=
, Length, Examples, Audience, Role) for structuring prompts, to methods lik=
e few-shot prompting (providing examples), chain-of-thought prompting (aski=
ng AI to show its reasoning), and persona prompting (assigning AI a specifi=
c role).=20
The guide also covers how different AI models have distinct "personalities"=
 and strengths, how to adjust parameters like temperature for creativity ve=
rsus precision, and advanced strategies like prompt chaining for complex ta=
sks. Ultimately, it's about transforming AI from a frustrating tool into a =
reliable partner through practice, persistence, and understanding that good=
 prompt engineering is simply the skill of giving clear directions=E2=80=94=
much like telling someone to "go to Safeway on Main Street and buy organic =
milk" rather than just saying "go to the store."

This comprehensive guide takes you on a complete journey through prompt eng=
ineering=E2=80=94the skill of crafting effective instructions for AI langua=
ge models=E2=80=94starting from the absolute basics and progressing all the=
 way to cutting-edge enterprise techniques. Whether you're just curious abo=
ut how to get better responses from ChatGPT or you're an engineer building =
production AI systems, you'll find practical, hands-on guidance tailored to=
 your level.=20
The guide begins by demystifying how AI models interpret your requests and =
teaches fundamental techniques, then gradually introduces more sophisticate=
d methods like chaining multiple prompts together, augmenting AI with exter=
nal knowledge databases, and even orchestrating multiple specialized AI age=
nts to collaborate on complex problems.=20
Beyond just techniques, it addresses real-world concerns like preventing pr=
ompt injection attacks, evaluating prompt performance systematically, manag=
ing costs, and building maintainable prompt libraries that teams can versio=
n and deploy like code. With its structured learning path, domain-specific =
examples for fields like marketing and legal analysis, and a 2025 addendum =
covering the latest security practices and personalization strategies, this=
 guide essentially transforms the "art" of talking to AI into a reliable en=
gineering discipline you can master step by step.
The Beginner's Handy Guide to Prompt Engineering
What Is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is simply learning how to write clear instructions for A=
I chatbots. The difference between getting frustrating, generic responses a=
nd getting exactly what you need often comes down to how you ask.
Think of it like giving directions. You could say "go to the store" (vague)=
 or "go to the Whole Foods on Main Street and buy organic milk" (specific).=
 With AI, specificity wins every time.
Key Reality Checks:
AI responds to exactly what you write, not what you mean
Clear and specific beats long and complex
Different tasks need different approaches
There's no "perfect prompt" that works for everything
How AI Chatbots Actually Work
AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are pattern-matching systems. =
They've been trained on millions of texts and predict what words should com=
e next based on patterns they've learned.
What This Means for You:
They don't "understand" - they recognize patterns
They have no memory between conversations
They can confidently state incorrect information
Being specific helps them find the right pattern
Context Windows: Think of this as the AI's "working memory" - how much it c=
an consider at once. Most modern chatbots can handle very long conversation=
s, but they still can't remember yesterday's chat unless you tell them abou=
t it.
The CLEAR Framework
Every good prompt should be CLEAR:
Context - Provide relevant background=20
Length - Specify how long you want the response=20
Examples - Show what you're looking for=20
Audience - Who is this for?=20
Role - What expertise should the AI use?
With 2025 reasoning models, you can mix these up a bit for simple asks and =
it=E2=80=99s entirely fine. If you=E2=80=99re being precise with a big prom=
pt, the order below works better.
Before and After CLEAR
Vague Request: "Help with email"
CLEAR Request:
Role: Professional business writer
Context: I need to decline a meeting invitation politely
Length: 2-3 sentences
Examples: Friendly but clear, like "I appreciate the invitation..."
Audience: My colleague who I work with regularly
The CLEAR version gets you exactly what you need on the first try.
Note: Advanced readers and regular followers of the substack will notice I=
=E2=80=99ve recommended more than one framework for prompting over the last=
 year or so. That=E2=80=99s intentional. Why?
Because first, models evolve. Second, different frameworks are memorable fo=
r different audiences. And third, each framework has slightly different emp=
hases, which is useful for developing an advanced understanding over time.=

So beginners: CLEAR is great and will go a long way.=20
If you=E2=80=99re still reading this and you=E2=80=99re advanced go look in=
 the A-to-Z guide for much much more detail and nuance.
Essential Techniques for Beginners
1. Zero-Shot: Just Ask Clearly
When you don't need to show examples, just be specific about what you want.
"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points focusing on the main findings, w=
ritten for someone with no technical background"
Use this for: Simple tasks, straightforward questions, quick translations
2. One-Shot: Show One Example
Give one example to set the pattern you want.
"Convert these meeting notes into action items.
Example:
Note: Sarah mentioned she'll review the budget by Friday
Action: Review budget (Owner: Sarah, Due: Friday)
Now convert: Tom said he'd contact the vendor about pricing tomorrow"
Use this for: Specific formats, consistent style, email templates
3. Few-Shot: Multiple Examples for Complex Patterns
Provide 2-3 examples when you need specific style or approach.
"Write product descriptions like these:
Product: Wireless earbuds
Description: "Crystal-clear calls from your couch to your commute. 8-hour b=
attery life keeps up with your day."
Product: Smart watch
Description: "Your health coach, assistant, and style statement on your wri=
st. Tracks what matters, ignores what doesn't."
Now write one for: Bluetooth speaker"
Use this for: Creative writing, maintaining tone, complex formatting
4. Chain-of-Thought: Make AI Show Its Work
Ask the AI to think through problems step-by-step.=20
Be careful here! Chain of thought prompting is not particularly useful with=
 reasoning models, but it is useful with non-reasoning models and enough pe=
ople use non-reasoning models that I=E2=80=99m choosing to present it here.=
 If your model takes awhile to think, don=E2=80=99t use this technique.
"I need to choose between two job offers. Please analyze them step by step:
Job A: $80k salary, 10 min commute, small company, great culture
Job B: $95k salary, 45 min commute, large company, standard benefits
Consider:
1. Financial difference after commute costs
2. Quality of life factors
3. Career growth potential
4. Your recommendation with reasoning"
Use this for: Decisions, complex problems, when you want to understand the =
logic
Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Fix Them
Mistake 1: Being Too Vague
Wrong: "Write something about dogs" Right: "Write a 200-word beginner's gui=
de to training a puppy, focusing on the first week at home"
Fix: Add specifics about topic, length, audience, and purpose
Mistake 2: Forgetting Your Audience
Wrong: "Explain quantum computing" Right: "Explain quantum computing to a h=
igh school student using analogies to everyday things"
Fix: Always specify who will read or use the output
Mistake 3: No Format Guidance
Wrong: "Give me tips for productivity" Right: "List 5 productivity tips for=
 remote workers, each with a one-sentence explanation"
Fix: Specify if you want paragraphs, bullets, numbered lists, etc.
Mistake 4: Unclear Tone
Wrong: "Write an email to my boss" Right: "Write a friendly but professiona=
l email to my boss requesting a day off next Friday"
Fix: Describe the tone you want (formal, casual, friendly, serious, etc.)
Mistake 5: Kitchen Sink Approach
Wrong: Including your entire company history when asking for a tagline Righ=
t: Include only directly relevant information
Fix: Give context that matters, skip what doesn't
The Universal Template
Here's a template that works for most situations:
You are a [role/expertise].
I need you to [specific task].
Context: [relevant background information]
Please create [exact output you want] that is [length] and written for [aud=
ience].
Use a [tone] tone.
[Any specific requirements or things to avoid]
Real Simple Example Using the Template
You are a nutrition expert.
I need you to create a meal plan.
Context: I'm vegetarian, trying to increase protein intake, and I have 30 m=
inutes max to cook dinner on weekdays.
Please create a 5-day dinner plan with recipes that take under 30 minutes a=
nd written for someone with basic cooking skills.
Use a friendly, encouraging tone.
Include the protein content for each meal and a shopping list at the end.
Quick Fixes for Common Problems
Problem: Response Too Long or Too Short
Don't say: "Make it shorter" Do say: "Maximum 100 words" or "3-4 sentences"=
 or "One paragraph"
Problem: Wrong Style or Tone
Don't say: "Make it better" Do say: "Rewrite in a conversational tone, like=
 explaining to a friend"
Problem: Missing Important Information
Don't say: "You forgot something" Do say: "Please add a section about [spec=
ific thing] including [specific details]"
Problem: Too Generic
Don't say: "Be more specific" Do say: "Focus specifically on [narrow topic]=
 for [specific situation]"
When AI Seems to Refuse
Sometimes AI won't do what you ask because it misinterprets your intent. Re=
frame your request:
Seems like: "Write a fake review" Reframe as: "Write an example review for =
training customer service reps to identify authentic feedback"
Seems like: "How do I hack..." Reframe as: "How do I protect my system from=
=2E.."
Building Your First Prompt Library
Start collecting prompts that work well for tasks you do regularly. I keep =
mine in Notion!
Email Response Template
Write a [type of email] to [recipient] about [topic].
Keep it [length] and use a [tone] tone.
Include [specific points].
End with [type of closing].
Content Creation Template
Create a [type of content] about [topic] for [audience].
Make it [length] with [tone/style].
Include [must-have elements].
Focus on [main message].
Problem-Solving Template
I'm facing this challenge: [describe problem]
My constraints are: [limitations]
Help me find [number] solutions that [criteria].
Consider [important factors].
Summary Template
Summarize [document/article/meeting] in [length].
Focus on [key aspects].
Written for [audience].
Ignore [irrelevant parts].
Testing and Improving Your Prompts
The three-try rule: Never settle for the first response.
Try 1: Write your initial prompt Try 2: Add missing specifics based on what=
 wasn't right Try 3: Refine format, tone, or examples
Example progression:
Try 1: "Write a cover letter"
Result: Too generic
Try 2: "Write a cover letter for a marketing position at a tech startup"
Result: Better but still formulaic
Try 3: "Write a cover letter for a marketing position at a tech startup. I =
have 5 years of social media experience and increased engagement by 200% at=
 my current job. Keep it under 300 words, confident but not boastful."
Result: Exactly what you need
Key Principles to Remember
Be Specific: Vague requests get vague results
Provide Context: AI can't read your mind
Define the Output: Say exactly what format you want
Specify Audience: Who will use this?
Set Boundaries: Include length, tone, and style
Show Examples: When format matters, show what you want
Iterate: First attempts are rarely perfect
Your Quick Reference Checklist
Before hitting enter, check:
=E2=9C=93 Is my request specific and clear?
=E2=9C=93 Did I specify the length I want?
=E2=9C=93 Is the audience defined?
=E2=9C=93 Did I indicate the tone/style needed?
=E2=9C=93 Is all the context necessary and relevant?
=E2=9C=93 Would an example help clarify what I want?
Emergency Reset
When nothing seems to work:
Let me start over. I need your help with something specific.
Task: [one clear thing you need]
Background: [only essential context]
Output: [exactly what format/length you want]
Can you help me with this?
The Most Important Thing
The difference between frustrating and excellent AI interactions usually is=
n't the AI - it's the prompt. Take 30 extra seconds to be specific about wh=
at you want, and you'll save minutes (or hours) of back-and-forth.
Start with the CLEAR framework. Practice on your real tasks. Build a collec=
tion of prompts that work. Remember: AI responds to what you write, not wha=
t you mean - so make your meaning clear.
Every expert was once a beginner. The only difference is practice. Your nex=
t prompt can be better than your last one, and that's all that matters.

prompt engineering teaches you how to communicate effectively with AI syste=
ms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini by crafting clear, specific instruction=
s (prompts) that get you the results you want. The guide explains that AI d=
oesn't actually &quot;think&quot; or understand implied meaning=E2=80=94it =
recognizes patterns and predicts responses based on exactly what you write=
=E2=80=94so being precise matters more than being clever or lengthy. </p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">You'll learn practical techniques ranging from the CLEAR framewo=
rk (Context, Length, Examples, Audience, Role) for structuring prompts, to =
methods like few-shot prompting (providing examples), chain-of-thought prom=
pting (asking AI to show its reasoning), and persona prompting (assigning A=
I a specific role). </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The guide also covers how different AI=
 models have distinct &quot;personalities&quot; and strengths, how to adjus=
t parameters like temperature for creativity versus precision, and advanced=
 strategies like prompt chaining for complex tasks. Ultimately, it's about =
transforming AI from a frustrating tool into a reliable partner through pra=
ctice, persistence, and understanding that good prompt engineering is simpl=
y the skill of giving clear directions=E2=80=94much like telling someone to=
 &quot;go to Safeway on Main Street and buy organic milk&quot; rather than =

 </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">The guide begins by demystifying how AI models interpret =
your requests and teaches fundamental techniques, then gradually introduces=
 more sophisticated methods like chaining multiple prompts together, augmen=
ting AI with external knowledge databases, and even orchestrating multiple =
specialized AI agents to collaborate on complex problems. </p><p style=3D"m=

ompt injection attacks, evaluating prompt performance systematically, manag=
ing costs, and building maintainable prompt libraries that teams can versio=
n and deploy like code. With its structured learning path, domain-specific =
examples for fields like marketing and legal analysis, and a 2025 addendum =
