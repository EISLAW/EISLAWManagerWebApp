George Answers Your Questions

Dear Subscriber=2C

Every letter sent in reaction to articles we write is read by us all on th=
e team. And last week=2C we began a new system of responding to your comme=
nts.

In general the criticisms of a particular article are repeated by many and=
 can be consolidated into a single if lengthy critique. Instead of repeati=
ng myself with slight variations in many answers we will gather the essenc=
e of the comments and especially challenges and criticisms that have been=
 leveled in the past week. I will then craft a response=2C which is emaile=
d out to all subscribers (excluding the names of those who wrote the comme=
nts) but they will likely know who they are.

This gives the many readers who don=E2=80=99t send comments to us a chance=
 to see what others are thinking=2C and likely many of them have the same=
 questions and doubts about what I write.

This is an imperfect system to be sure and obviously we may fail to succes=
sfully consolidate all of your thoughts into this system=2C but we will do=
 our best.

Part of my regret in not being able to answer individual emails is because=
 of the pleasure of interacting and arguing with my critics personally (I=
 actually love doing that) and building relationships. Our other analysts=
 who normally get less criticisms than I do will continue to answer emails=
 individually.  And for all of you who do praise or agree with something I=
 write I just say a general grateful thank you. And for those not interest=
ed in reading these=2C just hit the delete button.

With respect and gratitude.

George

May 5=2C 2025

Comment: Russia could have become a strong=2C peaceful ally of Europe=2C p=
roviding almost everything the continent needed: energy and raw materials=
=2C growing its economy=2C integrating with European countries=2C and beco=
ming more part of Europe instead of attacking a brother nation. Imagine th=
at Europe and Russia are at peace: no need for NATO or America!

But instead=2C Putin resorted to KGB days (Cold War) and attacked Ukraine.=
 The continent is polarized and fearful of Russia. Looking at Russian hist=
ory=2C I see that no Russian leader=2C in my view=2C has destroyed the fut=
ure of Russia as much as Putin. Do you agree with this view of Putin?

Response: I think that the Russian crisis is a crisis of history. Russia=
=2C like other nations=2C is governed by three things. The first is author=
itarian governments=2C the second is ideology=2C the third is geography. R=
ussia has always been authoritarian =E2=80=93 under the czars=2C the commu=
nists and now. But the first two had ideologies binding them. The czarists=
 had Christianity in the Russian Orthodox form. When Lenin overthrew them=
=2C a new ideology emerged: communism. But the governance of Russia remain=
ed the same.

When communism collapsed=2C the new ideology might have been liberal democ=
racy=2C but that collided with the tradition of governance by authority. T=
he interregnum between Brezhnev and Putin was filled with short-lived lead=
ers who sought to introduce a new ideology=2C liberal democracy=2C utterly=
 alien to Russia. Putin emerged as an authoritarian=2C returning to the Ru=
ssian norm. But he did not carry with him any ideology save nationalism=2C=
 not a transcendent vision as in Christianity and communism. He has=2C the=
refore=2C had to play nationalism as his only ideological card.

Russian nationalism has always been aggressive=2C defensive and paranoid=
 =E2=80=93 healthy traits for a country surrounded by potential enemies. N=
apoleon and Hitler both reached Moscow. When Russia considered its geograp=
hy=2C it looked for danger from the West and it saw NATO as an aggressive=
 force. The invasion of Ukraine flowed from that nationalism and the geogr=
aphical reality. The northern border of Ukraine is a few hundred miles fro=
m Moscow. Ukraine had been part of Czarist Russia and the Soviet Union and=
 had served as a buffer. The Russian response to the perceived threat was=
 to retake Ukraine=2C preventing NATO from integrating it and lessening Ru=
ssia=E2=80=99s vulnerability.

Putin acted toward Ukraine as the czars and communists did=2C but with a m=
uch weaker army=2C because he was inherently weaker than the czars and the=
 communists. He had only nationalism to bind the Russians together=2C and=
 transcendent ideologies give power to the nation and its army. So=2C if h=
e had any failure=2C it was that there was no ideology around which to org=
anize the national spirit. He is an authoritarian without moral justificat=
ion. And so he could not rally his country to a higher cause. Nationalism=
 matters=2C but only if the nation has a higher meaning. It was not Putin=
=E2=80=99s failure but a historical crisis that could not be resolved.
Question: Can Eastern Europe form a strong enough security alliance to pro=
tect itself and thus Western Europe from potential future Russian aggressi=
on?


Response: Historically=2C the answer would be no=2C because as I said in t=
he original article=2C Western Europe=E2=80=99s wealth was based on imperi=
alism. However=2C at this point in history=2C the dynamism of Western Euro=
pe prior to World War II and the collapse of the European imperium has mad=
e stability =E2=80=93 don=E2=80=99t lose power or gain power =E2=80=93 a p=
rofound weakness in the West. In Eastern Europe I am seeing a greater dyna=
mism created by the value of lower cost labor in a highly educated populat=
ion with a potentially strong economy=2C and the fear of both Russia and W=
estern Europe. Fear and greed are powerful forces=2C but only if they can=
 unite and surge together. But the historical bad memories between Eastern=
 European countries and the deep distrust is the challenge. If Eastern Eur=
ope can overcome that mutual loathing =E2=80=93 and necessity is the found=
ation of friendship =E2=80=93 they can surge dramatically=2C in my opinion=
=2E
Comment/criticism: You are right about the past=2C about quarrels and divi=
sions in Europe. But you cannot simply forget one part of that past. More=
 or less U.S.-sustained=2C the European Union exists. Not being a geopolit=
ical entity=2C it still has a powerful weapon =E2=80=93 a common trade pol=
icy. Eastern European countries know that and still have an interest to st=
ay (even Hungary) or to join the EU.

In my opinion=2C the end of a common trade policy is the reason why the U.=
S. is now supporting every European political movement or personality that=
 defends a return to a Europe of Nations =E2=80=93 meaning a return to 194=
4.

Response: The European Union has=2C in my mind=2C two major defects. One y=
ou already referred to=2C which is that they only deal with economic matte=
rs. While important=2C that does not address an equally or more important=
 dimension: national security. In addition=2C the EU only addresses some d=
imensions of economics=2C leaving each nation substantial room for uncoord=
inated action. This means that for the EU=2C an attack on one country is n=
ot an attack on all=2C and that all nations=2C in the event of war=2C do n=
ot have to participate=2C making the economic needs for countries at war l=
ikely to be incompatible with those not at war=2C or the EU as a whole. Th=
is is the same defect as NATO has; it is only a security entity=2C without=
 significant control over the economics of defense.

Second=2C there are vast differences between EU member countries=2C not on=
ly on economic reality but also about core issues of national interest. Fo=
r me=2C it is a union of the willing=2C encompassing countries as differen=
t as Cyprus and France=2C each at very different stages of economic develo=
pment. There is minimal control over Europe=E2=80=99s economy as a whole=
=2C while the economic realities of the widely disparate countries vary pr=
ofoundly. The EU covers only some dimensions of economic affairs as a resu=
lt. So I regard it as a useful vehicle for a certain degree of economic re=

;text-align: left;">Dear Subscriber,<br>
<br>
Every letter sent in reaction to articles we write is read by us all on the=
 team. And last week, we began a new system of responding to your comments.=
<br>
<br>
In general the criticisms of a particular article are repeated by many and =
can be consolidated into a single if lengthy critique. Instead of repeating=
 myself with slight variations in many answers we will gather the essence o=
f the comments and especially challenges and criticisms that have been leve=
led in the past week. I will then craft a response, which is emailed out to=
 all subscribers (excluding the names of those who wrote the comments) but =
they will likely know who they are.<br>
<br>
This gives the many readers who don=E2=80=99t send comments to us a chance =
to see what others are thinking, and likely many of them have the same ques=
tions and doubts about what I write.<br>
<br>
This is an imperfect system to be sure and obviously we may fail to success=
fully consolidate all of your thoughts into this system, but we will do our=
 best.<br>
<br>
Part of my regret in not being able to answer individual emails is because =
of the pleasure of interacting and arguing with my critics personally (I ac=
tually love doing that) and building relationships. Our other analysts who =
normally get less criticisms than I do will continue to answer emails indiv=
idually.&nbsp; And for all of you who do praise or agree with something I w=
rite I just say a general grateful thank you. And for those not interested =
in reading these, just hit the delete button.<br>
<br>
With respect and gratitude.<br>
<br>
George</p>

Comment:</strong><em> Russia could have become a strong, peaceful ally of E=
urope, providing almost everything the continent needed: energy and raw mat=
erials, growing its economy, integrating with European countries, and becom=
ing more part of Europe instead of attacking a brother nation. Imagine that=
 Europe and Russia are at peace: no need for NATO or America!<br>
<br>
But instead, Putin resorted to KGB days (Cold War) and attacked Ukraine. Th=
e continent is polarized and fearful of Russia. Looking at Russian history,=
 I see that no Russian leader, in my view, has destroyed the future of Russ=
ia as much as Putin. Do you agree with this view of Putin?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>I think that the Russian crisis is a crisis of h=
istory. Russia, like other nations, is governed by three things. The first =
is authoritarian governments, the second is ideology, the third is geograph=
y. Russia has always been authoritarian =E2=80=93 under the czars, the comm=
unists and now. But the first two had ideologies binding them. The czarists=
 had Christianity in the Russian Orthodox form. When Lenin overthrew them, =
a new ideology emerged: communism. But the governance of Russia remained th=
e same.<br>
<br>
When communism collapsed, the new ideology might have been liberal democrac=
y, but that collided with the tradition of governance by authority. The int=
erregnum between Brezhnev and Putin was filled with short-lived leaders who=
 sought to introduce a new ideology, liberal democracy, utterly alien to Ru=
ssia. Putin emerged as an authoritarian, returning to the Russian norm. But=
 he did not carry with him any ideology save nationalism, not a transcenden=
t vision as in Christianity and communism. He has, therefore, had to play n=
ationalism as his only ideological card.<br>
<br>
Russian nationalism has always been aggressive, defensive and paranoid =E2=
=80=93 healthy traits for a country surrounded by potential enemies. Napole=
on and Hitler both reached Moscow. When Russia considered its geography, it=
 looked for danger from the West and it saw NATO as an aggressive force. Th=
e invasion of Ukraine flowed from that nationalism and the geographical rea=
lity. The northern border of Ukraine is a few hundred miles from Moscow. Uk=
raine had been part of Czarist Russia and the Soviet Union and had served a=
s a buffer. The Russian response to the perceived threat was to retake Ukra=
ine, preventing NATO from integrating it and lessening Russia=E2=80=99s vul=
nerability.<br>
<br>
Putin acted toward Ukraine as the czars and communists did, but with a much=
 weaker army, because he was inherently weaker than the czars and the commu=
nists. He had only nationalism to bind the Russians together, and transcend=
ent ideologies give power to the nation and its army. So, if he had any fai=
lure, it was that there was no ideology around which to organize the nation=
al spirit. He is an authoritarian without moral justification. And so he co=
uld not rally his country to a higher cause. Nationalism matters, but only =
if the nation has a higher meaning. It was not Putin=E2=80=99s failure but =
a historical crisis that could not be resolved.</p>

                            <strong>Question: </strong><em>Can Eastern Euro=
pe form a strong enough security alliance to protect itself and thus Wester=
n Europe from potential future Russian aggression?</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Historically, the answer would be no, because as=
 I said in the original article, Western Europe=E2=80=99s wealth was based =
on imperialism. However, at this point in history, the dynamism of Western =
Europe prior to World War II and the collapse of the European imperium has =
made stability =E2=80=93&nbsp;don=E2=80=99t lose power or gain power =E2=80=
=93 a profound weakness in the West. In Eastern Europe I am seeing a greate=
r dynamism created by the value of lower cost labor in a highly educated po=
pulation with a potentially strong economy, and the fear of both Russia and=
 Western Europe. Fear and greed are powerful forces, but only if they can u=
nite and surge together. But the historical bad memories between Eastern Eu=
ropean countries and the deep distrust is the challenge. If Eastern Europe =
can overcome that mutual loathing =E2=80=93 and necessity is the foundation=
 of friendship =E2=80=93 they can surge dramatically, in my opinion.

                            <div><strong>Comment/criticism</strong>: <em>Yo=
u are right about the past, about quarrels and divisions in Europe. But you=
 cannot simply forget one part of that past. More or less U.S.-sustained, t=
he European Union exists. Not being a geopolitical&nbsp;entity, it still ha=
s a powerful weapon =E2=80=93 a common trade policy. Eastern European count=
ries know that and still have an interest to stay (even Hungary) or to join=
 the EU.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the end&nbsp;of a common&nbsp;trade policy is the reason why=
 the U.S. is now supporting every European political movement or personalit=
y that defends&nbsp;a return to a Europe of Nations =E2=80=93 meaning a ret=
urn&nbsp;to 1944.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The European Union has, in my mind, two major de=
fects. One you already referred to, which is that they only deal with econo=
mic matters. While important, that does not address an equally or more impo=
rtant dimension: national security. In addition, the EU only addresses some=
 dimensions of economics, leaving each nation substantial room for uncoordi=
nated action. This means that for the EU, an attack on one country is not a=
n attack on all, and that all nations, in the event of war, do not have to =
participate, making the economic needs for countries at war likely to be in=
compatible with those not at war, or the EU as a whole. This is the same de=
fect as NATO has; it is only a security entity, without significant control=
 over the economics of defense.<br>
<br>
Second, there are vast differences between EU member countries, not only on=
 economic reality but also about core issues of national interest. For me, =
it is a union of the willing, encompassing countries as different as Cyprus=
 and France, each at very different stages of economic development. There i=
s minimal control over Europe=E2=80=99s economy as a whole, while the econo=
mic realities of the widely disparate countries vary profoundly. The EU cov=
ers only some dimensions of economic affairs as a result. So I regard it as=
 a useful vehicle for a certain degree of economic reality, but not as a de=
fining force of Europe. Bulgaria and France are both members, but with very=
 different economic realities.</div>
