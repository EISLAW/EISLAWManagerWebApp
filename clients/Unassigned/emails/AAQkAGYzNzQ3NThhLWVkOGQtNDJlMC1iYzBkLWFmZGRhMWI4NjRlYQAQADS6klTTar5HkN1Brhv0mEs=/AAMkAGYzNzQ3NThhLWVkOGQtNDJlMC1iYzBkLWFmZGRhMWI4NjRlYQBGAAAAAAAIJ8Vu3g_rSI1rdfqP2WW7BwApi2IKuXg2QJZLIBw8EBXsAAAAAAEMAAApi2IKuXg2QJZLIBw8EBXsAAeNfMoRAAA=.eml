DAILY MEMO: PRESSURE MOUNTS ON HAMAS [3]
ISRAELI FORCES HAVE NEARLY COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED GAZA CITY.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
PUSH FOR PEACE. The United States will give Hamas three to four days to respond to its plan to end the fighting in Gaza, President Donald Trump told reporters [4]. If Hamas rejects the deal, he said,
Israel will “do what it must.” As for Hamas, according to a senior representative who spoke with the BBC [5], the group will most likely reject the plan. The source said Hamas is unlikely to agree
to disarm and surrender its weapons, key components of the proposal.
OTHERS WEIGH IN. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Qatar, which is acting as a mediator between the two sides, said the proposal is in its early stages and details still need to be worked out –
including Israel’s withdrawal from the strip, the conditions for which require “clarification and discussion.” He also said [6] the plan’s aim to create a postwar government in Gaza will be
discussed with Washington but not with Israel. Other countries are also sharing their thoughts on the plan: The foreign ministers of France and Turkey reportedly discussed [7] a potential ceasefire in
Gaza during a call on Tuesday.
SURROUNDED. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned [8] on Wednesday that the military was close to fully encircling Gaza City and that residents fleeing the area would be forced to pass through
Israeli checkpoints. Those who choose to stay will be treated as “terrorists and supporters of terror.”
EUROPEAN INDUSTRY. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged [9] the European Union to apply tariffs on several industries to protect European businesses. Ahead of an EU leaders’ meeting in
Copenhagen, he said Europe lags behind China and the U.S. in protecting domestic industries and called for measures beyond the tariffs already imposed on Chinese electric vehicles. Relatedly, to
protect Europe’s steel sector from subsidized Chinese supplies, the European Union reportedly plans [10] to cut steel import quotas by nearly 50 percent and impose a 50 percent tariff on imports
that exceed those limits. It’s also weighing protections for the aluminum sector and possible export duties on scrap metal.
UZBEK PARTNERS. The parliamentary speakers from Uzbekistan and Pakistan held talks [11] in Islamabad focused on bilateral relations and strengthening their countries' strategic partnership. The
Pakistani official reaffirmed his country’s support for the construction of the Trans-Afghan Railway and Uzbek manufacturers’ use of Pakistani ports. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan and the United States
have agreed to implement energy projects worth a total of $3 billion-$4 billion, the Uzbek energy minister said. They include an agreement with U.S. firm Air Products to expedite development of
natural gas, coal and fuel projects.
RUSSIAN GASOLINE. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has proposed [12] new measures to increase Russia’s gasoline supplies amid continued shortages in some regions of the country. He
suggested temporarily permitting the use of monomethylaniline, an octane-boosting additive banned since 2016, to boost production. Novak also proposed instructing the Ministry of Finance to create
incentives for the use of ethyl alcohol in gasoline production by abolishing the excise tax on ethyl alcohol. He also suggested [13] eliminating import duties on gasoline from China, South Korea and
Singapore.
DEADLOCKED. The U.S. federal government has officially shut down [14] after Congress failed to pass a budget for the next fiscal year. It’s the first shutdown since 2019, though partial suspensions
of government operations have happened in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of government workers are being furloughed, while critical services (health care providers, border guards, military
personnel, transportation workers and others) continue to work without guarantees of timely payment.
SERVICE DISRUPTION. The Taliban have cut internet and mobile phone data services across Afghanistan, diplomatic and industry sources said [15] on Tuesday. Residents and monitoring services have
reported disruptions to internet connections, flights and financial services. On Wednesday, however, Taliban officials denied [16] imposing restrictions, saying the disruption was a result of old
fiber-optic cables in need of repair.
AFGHAN UNCERTAINTY. Employees of budgetary institutions in Kabul, Afghanistan, have been told not to return to work as of Oct. 4, the head of Russia’s Center for the Study of Contemporary
Afghanistan, Andrey Serenko, reported [17]. According to his sources, workers believe the order is due to expectations that the U.S. could soon storm the Bagram air base, which could lead to the fall
of the capital.
JOBS ON THE LINE. The U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act expired [18] on Tuesday. The 25-year-old agreement gave African countries preferential access to U.S. markets. Despite Trump
administration officials indicating that the president supported a one-year renewal, no efforts have been made to extend the legislation. Hundreds of thousands of jobs across Africa are now reportedly
at risk due to its expiration.
STRENGTHENING TIES. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov held talks [19] with a senior adviser in the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and the U.S. charge
d’affaires in Baku. They discussed bilateral relations and the establishment of a joint working group on creating a strategic partnership. They also discussed the normalization of relations between
Azerbaijan and Armenia, including the peace deal reached in Washington in August.
EU OUTREACH. The European Union and Vietnam have agreed [20] to set up a special task force to address barriers to trade. They pledged to maintain dialogue on the matter and encourage EU investment in
areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, digital transformation and renewable energy.
EU EXPANSION. Moldova could join the European Union within three years, Romanian President Nicusor Dan said [21], following the country’s election of a pro-EU party. On the issue of Transnistria, he
suggested the region could be given autonomous status within Moldova, similar to Gagauzia, and then join the accession process.
DRILLS. India and Russia began [22] on Wednesday joint ground forces exercises in the western Indian state of Rajasthan. Approximately 250 Russian military personnel will participate in the drills,
which are held every two years.
