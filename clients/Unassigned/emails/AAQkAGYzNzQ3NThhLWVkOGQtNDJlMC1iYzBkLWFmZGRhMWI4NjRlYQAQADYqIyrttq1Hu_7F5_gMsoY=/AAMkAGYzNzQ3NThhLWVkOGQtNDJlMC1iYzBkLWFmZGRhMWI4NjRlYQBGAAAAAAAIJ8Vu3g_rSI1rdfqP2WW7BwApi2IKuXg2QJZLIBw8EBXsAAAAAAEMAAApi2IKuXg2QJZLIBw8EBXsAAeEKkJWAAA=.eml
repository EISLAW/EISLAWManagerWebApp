We picked up some shares of WALMART INC. (TICKER: WMT), and by
Wednesday, it was already knocking it out of the park. Shoutout to
Licia and Mark!

Funny enough, WMT was actually Licia=E2=80=99s top pick this year for our
=E2=80=9CMake America Healthy Again=E2=80=9D (MAHA) stock theme=E2=80=94tha=
nks to their
push for more affordable produce, which could be a quiet but powerful
growth driver.

week=E2=80=94MAKE SURE TO MARK YOUR CALENDAR AND JOIN IN!

1dd8a949dc90276ac751de4e03/57]

Anyway, here are my picks for the week.

MY SHORT PICK: AVGO

My short pick from last week, ORACLE INC. (TICKER: ORCL), is down
overall=E2=80=94despite a brief bounce earlier in the week, it=E2=80=99s st=
ill
trading well below where I flagged it. I=E2=80=99ve assigned Detective Frank
Gregory to dig into ORCL=E2=80=99s earnings for Cap Gains=E2=80=94let=E2=80=
=99s see what
he uncovers.

As it stands now, every major member of the =E2=80=9CMagnificent
Seven=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94plus BROADCOM CORP. (TICKER: AVGO), making it the =
=E2=80=9CGreat
Eight=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94is trading at a hefty 10x revenue or more. Most of t=
hem,
with the exception of ALPHABET INC. (TICKER: GOOGL), are giving back
some of their 2025 gains after meteoric runs.

Don=E2=80=99t get me wrong=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99m still bullish on semiconduct=
ors long
term. But even great sectors need to catch their breath now and then.

[frep]

_1 YEAR AVGO CHART WITH 1 DAY CANDLES_

_30 AND 60 DAY IMPLIED VOLATILITY (RED AND YELLOW) FOR ORCL_

After the initial post-earnings dip, AVGO is now showing signs of a
volatility bid=E2=80=94suggesting it's not done retracing that earnings gap.
Typically, if a stock is going to hold its gains, I expect to see
option volatility gradually decline or flatten out=E2=80=94not start
climbing again like we're seeing here.

Following the FOMC, traders will likely be looking for bargains=E2=80=94and
AVGO isn't one right now. I=E2=80=99m expecting some profit-taking to drag
the stock back into the $330s, potentially slipping below that ugly
earnings red candle.

No doubt, AVGO is a fantastic company, but with it hovering near the
$1 trillion market cap, short-term sellers are likely to step in
before it can push higher.

MY LONG PICK: TYSON FOODS INC (TICKER: TSN)

The MARKET VECTORS GOLD MINERS ETF (TICKER: GDX) was performing well
up until Monday before giving back some gains. I traded a GDX strangle
in RIPZONE
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/7e72b3ad537242e0be50ab1e42289a3d-f0edd8=
5597db4701bd506fe311a32af3/57]
with my roomies=E2=80=94we booked some profits and are still holding credit
lotto calls heading into the FOMC.

This might be early, but RFK Jr. is starting to gain traction on the
issue of junk ingredients in our processed foods. One interesting
ripple: TYSON FOODS INC. (TICKER: TSN) just announced it=E2=80=99s removing
high fructose corn syrup from its products. That could help stabilize
the stock after its recent slide.

TSN is a major food producer, trading at a very low multiple, with a
high dividend yield=E2=80=94a setup that could appeal to dividend capture
strategies. That said, call option premiums are quite low, so it may
not offer much juice for short-term traders.

[frep]

1 YEAR TSN CHART WITH 30 AND 60 DAY IVS

More importantly, TSN is now on my radar for Option Fingerprints.
I=E2=80=99m looking to see if institutions are thinking along the same
lines=E2=80=94accumulating a large commodity food producer as interest rates
trend lower.

So far, the January 2027 open interest is still very light, even when
TSN was trading at its recent lows=E2=80=94and it hasn=E2=80=99t picked up =
much
since. Honestly, I=E2=80=99d prefer to see a bit more buying activity before
getting too excited, but the underlying story is compelling.

This is an early-stage idea=E2=80=94but TSN could end up being a solid
beneficiary of the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) trend.
