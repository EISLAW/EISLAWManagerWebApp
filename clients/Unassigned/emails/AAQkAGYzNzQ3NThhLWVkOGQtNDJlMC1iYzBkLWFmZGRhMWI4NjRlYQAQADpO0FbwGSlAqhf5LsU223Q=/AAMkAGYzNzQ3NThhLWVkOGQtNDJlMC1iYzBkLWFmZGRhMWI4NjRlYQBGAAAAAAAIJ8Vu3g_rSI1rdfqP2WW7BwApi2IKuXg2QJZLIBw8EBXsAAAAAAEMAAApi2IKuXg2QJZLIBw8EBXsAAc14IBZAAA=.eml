Welcome, Watcher! This week in LLM Watch:
Leading the charge, Anthropic's Claude 4 transforms how AI tackles complex =
workflows with its dual-model approach. By combining Opus 4's heavyweight r=
easoning with Sonnet 4's everyday capabilities - both featuring extended th=
inking modes, tool integration, and 200K context windows - Claude 4 maintai=
ns coherence across multi-hour sessions and complex projects. With the abil=
ity to create persistent memory files while reducing hallucinations by 65%,=
 we're witnessing AI that can truly own end-to-end development tasks withou=
t constant human supervision.
Next, Meta's J1 might change how we evaluate AI outputs through "thinking o=
ut loud" judges trained via reinforcement learning. Using just 22K syntheti=
c examples, these judges outperform models distilled from much larger reaso=
ning engines - even beating a 671B parameter MoE with a 70B footprint. By e=
xplicitly reasoning before rendering verdicts and dramatically reducing ord=
ering bias, J1 creates more trustworthy evaluation tools that handle both o=
bjective and subjective tasks with remarkable efficiency.
Finally, s3 proves that less really can be more in AI search by decoupling =
retrieval from generation. By training only the search component with downs=
tream-aware rewards, s3 achieves superior results with 70x less data and 33=
x faster training than end-to-end alternatives. This lightweight, modular a=
pproach not only outperforms conventional methods across both general and s=
pecialized domains but works seamlessly with any frozen or proprietary LLM =
- demonstrating that thoughtful architecture matters more than massive data=
 or brute-force fine-tuning.

1. Introducing Claude 4
Watching: Claude 4 (blog [ https://substack.com/redirect/be7d7fc3-f0c0-418c=
-a699-7d5dc40a5507?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Modern AI helpers often hit a wall when faced w=
ith super-long or really tricky coding and reasoning tasks - they can=E2=80=
=99t juggle lots of details, can=E2=80=99t pause to call on tools like web =
search mid-thought, and lose track of things if you ask them to work for ho=
urs without a break.
How does it solve the problem? Anthropic built two new =E2=80=9CClaude 4=E2=
=80=9D models - Opus 4 for heavyweight, multi-step coding jobs and Sonnet 4=
 for everyday tasks - each with two modes: a near-instant response and an =
=E2=80=9Cextended thinking=E2=80=9D mode that can call tools (web search, c=
ode runners, etc.) in parallel. They also gave both models a massive 200 K-=
token context window and the ability to create =E2=80=9Cmemory files=E2=80=
=9D when granted local file access, so key facts stick around for the long =
haul.
What are the key findings? Opus 4 now tops real-world coding benchmarks lik=
e SWE-bench and Terminal-bench and can sustain focused work over thousands =
of steps (even seven-hour refactors), while Sonnet 4 pushes Sonnet 3.7=E2=
=80=99s coding score even higher and follows complex instructions more prec=
isely. According to Anthropic, both models are roughly 65% less prone to ta=
king shortcuts or hallucinating answers on agentic tasks.
Why does it matter? This brings us closer to AI that can own entire softwar=
e workflows - remembering context, fetching external info on the fly, and s=
taying coherent across long sessions - so developers can trust AI companion=
s with bigger, more complex projects without constant supervision.

2. J1: Incentivizing Thinking in LLM-as-a-Judge via Reinforcement Learning
Watching:  J1 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/9b53d667-5129-4a57-ba5=
4-3b014332582a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Modern AI systems - especially large language m=
odels - are only as good as the tools we use to evaluate them. Current =E2=
=80=9CLLM-as-a-Judge=E2=80=9D approaches often make snap judgments without =
clear reasoning, suffer from ordering biases (preferring the first=E2=80=90=
shown answer), and struggle to handle both objectively verifiable tasks (li=
ke math problems) and more subjective user prompts. This evaluation bottlen=
eck limits our ability to reliably align, benchmark, and improve LLMs acros=
s diverse applications.
How does it solve the problem? The team from Meta introduces J1, a reinforc=
ement-learning recipe that trains LLM judges to =E2=80=9Cthink out loud=E2=
=80=9D via chain-of-thought before deciding which of two responses is bette=
r. First, they turn every evaluation (verifiable or not) into a task with a=
 clear right answer by synthetically generating high-quality and low-qualit=
y response pairs. Then they train both pairwise (compare A vs. B) and point=
wise (score each answer independently) judges using a verifiable reward sig=
nal - correct verdicts earn positive points and consistency across response=
 orders earns extra points - optimized via the GRPO algorithm. They also de=
sign =E2=80=9Cseed prompts=E2=80=9D to guide the model=E2=80=99s internal r=
easoning and mitigate position bias.
What are the key findings? J1-based judges at 8B and 70B parameters consist=
ently beat all prior 8B and 70B SOTA judge models - including those distill=
ed from much larger reasoning engines - across five benchmarks (PPE, Reward=
Bench, JudgeBench, RM-Bench, FollowBenchEval). The 70B J1 model even out-pe=
rforms a 671B Mixture-of-Experts model on subjective tasks. Test-time trick=
s like self-consistency and score averaging further boost accuracy, and the=
 pointwise variant nearly eliminates order bias while maintaining high judg=
ment quality.
Why does it matter? Reliable, (relatively) unbiased evaluation is crucial f=
or safe and effective LLM development - from training with human feedback t=
o real-world deployment. J1 demonstrates that with only 22K synthetic examp=
les and online RL, you can build a generalist judge that reasons explicitly=
, handles both objective and subjective prompts, and scales to test-time im=
provements. This reduces reliance on costly human annotations, tightens the=
 feedback loop for model alignment, and paves the way for more trustworthy =
AI systems.

What problem does it solve? Large language models often need to =E2=80=9Clo=
ok things up=E2=80=9D at inference time via Retrieval-Augmented Generation =
(RAG), but existing retrieval learners either optimize proxy scores (like N=
DCG) that don=E2=80=99t guarantee better answers or jointly fine-tune the e=
ntire model - entangling search with text generation, wasting data, compute=
, and making it hard to plug into frozen or proprietary LLMs. The core chal=
lenge is: how do you train a lightweight =E2=80=9Csearcher=E2=80=9D that ge=
nuinely boosts downstream answer quality with minimal supervision?
How does it solve the problem? They introduce s3, a modular search-only age=
nt trained by reinforcement learning (PPO) against a novel =E2=80=9CGain Be=
yond RAG=E2=80=9D (GBR) reward. GBR measures the delta in generation accura=
cy when using s3=E2=80=99s retrieved documents versus na=C3=AFve top-k retr=
ieval. In each multi-turn loop, the searcher issues a query, fetches result=
s, selects the most relevant documents (up to three), and decides when to s=
top. Crucially, the generator LLM remains frozen - only the search policy i=
s learned - and it requires just 2.4 K training examples.
What are the key findings? Despite using 70x less training data, s3 outperf=
orms static retrievers (BM25, E5), zero-shot active methods (IRCoT), retrie=
val-only RL (DeepRetrieval) and end-to-end RL (Search-R1) on six general-do=
main and five medical QA benchmarks. It achieves an average generation accu=
racy of 58.9% on general QA and 76.6% in medical QA (versus =E2=89=A454% an=
d =E2=89=A474% for baselines), and it cuts total training time by roughly 3=
3x compared to Search-R1.
Why does it matter? They demonstrate that most of the gain in RAG comes fro=
m smarter search, not giant end-to-end models or massive datasets. By decou=
pling - and directly optimizing - the search component with a downstream-aw=
are reward, s3 offers a data- and compute-efficient path to ground LLMs, wo=
rks with any frozen or proprietary generator, and even generalizes zero-sho=
t to specialized domains like medicine. This modular, sustainable approach =
lowers the barrier for building reliable, up-to-date QA systems.

w AI tackles complex workflows with its dual-model approach. By combining O=
pus 4's heavyweight reasoning with Sonnet 4's everyday capabilities - both =
featuring extended thinking modes, tool integration, and 200K context windo=
ws - Claude 4 maintains coherence across multi-hour sessions and complex pr=
ojects. With the ability to create persistent memory files while reducing h=
allucinations by 65%, we're witnessing AI that can truly own end-to-end dev=
elopment tasks without constant human supervision.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Next, Me=
ta's J1 might change how we evaluate AI outputs through &quot;thinking out =
loud&quot; judges trained via reinforcement learning. Using just 22K synthe=
tic examples, these judges outperform models distilled from much larger rea=
soning engines - even beating a 671B parameter MoE with a 70B footprint. By=
 explicitly reasoning before rendering verdicts and dramatically reducing o=
rdering bias, J1 creates more trustworthy evaluation tools that handle both=
 objective and subjective tasks with remarkable efficiency.</p><p style=3D"=

>Finally, s3 proves that less really can be more in AI search by decoupling=
 retrieval from generation. By training only the search component with down=
stream-aware rewards, s3 achieves superior results with 70x less data and 3=
3x faster training than end-to-end alternatives. This lightweight, modular =
approach not only outperforms conventional methods across both general and =
specialized domains but works seamlessly with any frozen or proprietary LLM=
 - demonstrating that thoughtful architecture matters more than massive dat=
a or brute-force fine-tuning.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=

pointwise (score each answer independently) judges using a verifiable rewar=

(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What problem does it=
 solve? </strong><span>Large language models often need to =E2=80=9Clook th=
ings up=E2=80=9D at inference time via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)=
, but existing retrieval learners either optimize proxy scores (like NDCG) =
that don=E2=80=99t guarantee better answers or jointly fine-tune the entire=
 model - entangling search with text generation, wasting data, compute, and=
 making it hard to plug into frozen or proprietary LLMs. The core challenge=
 is: how do you train a lightweight =E2=80=9Csearcher=E2=80=9D that genuine=
ly boosts downstream answer quality with minimal supervision?</span></p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem? </strong><span>They introd=
uce s3, a modular search-only agent trained by reinforcement learning (PPO)=
 against a novel =E2=80=9CGain Beyond RAG=E2=80=9D (GBR) reward. GBR measur=
es the delta in generation accuracy when using s3=E2=80=99s retrieved docum=
ents versus na=C3=AFve top-k retrieval. In each multi-turn loop, the search=
er issues a query, fetches results, selects the most relevant documents (up=
 to three), and decides when to stop. Crucially, the generator LLM remains =
frozen - only the search policy is learned - and it requires just 2.4 K tra=
ining examples.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings? <=
/strong><span>Despite using 70x less training data, s3 outperforms static r=
etrievers (BM25, E5), zero-shot active methods (IRCoT), retrieval-only RL (=
DeepRetrieval) and end-to-end RL (Search-R1) on six general-domain and five=
 medical QA benchmarks. It achieves an average generation accuracy of 58.9%=
 on general QA and 76.6% in medical QA (versus =E2=89=A454% and =E2=89=A474=
% for baselines), and it cuts total training time by roughly 33x compared t=
o Search-R1.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><s=
pan>They demonstrate that most of the gain in RAG comes from smarter search=
, not giant end-to-end models or massive datasets. By decoupling - and dire=
ctly optimizing - the search component with a downstream-aware reward, s3 o=
ffers a data- and compute-efficient path to ground LLMs, works with any fro=
zen or proprietary generator, and even generalizes zero-shot to specialized=
 domains like medicine. This modular, sustainable approach lowers the barri=
er for building reliable, up-to-date QA systems.</span></p><div style=3D"fo=
