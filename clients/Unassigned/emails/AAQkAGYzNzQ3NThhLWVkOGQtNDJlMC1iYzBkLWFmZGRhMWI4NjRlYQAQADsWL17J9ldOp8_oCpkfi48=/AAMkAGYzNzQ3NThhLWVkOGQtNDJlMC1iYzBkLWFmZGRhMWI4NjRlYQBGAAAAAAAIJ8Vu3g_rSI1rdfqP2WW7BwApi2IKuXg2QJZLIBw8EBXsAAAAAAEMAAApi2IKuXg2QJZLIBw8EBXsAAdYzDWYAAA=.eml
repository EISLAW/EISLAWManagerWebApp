For something a little different, I=E2=80=99m going to share seven essays t=
hat have had the most impact on my product career=E2=80=94that you likely h=
aven=E2=80=99t read.
There=E2=80=99s so much content flying at us these days, it=E2=80=99s hard =
to separate the =E2=80=9Cthis sounds so smart!=E2=80=9D from the =E2=80=9Ct=
his is genuinely correct, helpful, and timeless.=E2=80=9D The essays below =
are ones I find myself quoting from, sharing with people, and coming back t=
o most often, even though most are decades old.
=E2=80=9CThe thing I=E2=80=99ve tried to do the last few years is =E2=80=98=
barbell=E2=80=99 my inputs. I basically read things that are either up to t=
his minute or things that are timeless. I=E2=80=99m trying to not read anyt=
hing that=E2=80=99s from yesterday through to like 10 years ago.=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=94Marc Andreessen
Note that this isn=E2=80=99t an exhaustive list. And I=E2=80=99m not includ=
ing books=E2=80=94yet. This post is the beginning of an essential and timel=
ess reading library meant specifically for product leaders.
I=E2=80=99d love your help building out this list. What=E2=80=99s missing? =
Let me know in the comments. Bonus points for sharing the impact it had on =
your career/life, and more bonus points for sharing stuff people may not ha=
ve heard of. =F0=9F=91=87
1. Who=E2=80=99s Got the Monkey [ https://substack.com/redirect/a9e5ba39-f7=

nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]?, by William Oncken, Jr., and Donald L. Wass
=E2=80=9CLet us imagine that a manager is walking down the hall and that he=
 notices one of his subordinates, Jones, coming his way. When the two meet,=
 Jones greets the manager with, =E2=80=98Good morning. By the way, we=E2=80=
=99ve got a problem. You see. . . .=E2=80=99 As Jones continues, the manage=
r recognizes in this problem the two characteristics common to all the prob=
lems his subordinates gratuitously bring to his attention. Namely, the mana=
ger knows (a) enough to get involved, but (b) not enough to make the on-the=
-spot decision expected of him. Eventually, the manager says, =E2=80=98So g=
lad you brought this up. I=E2=80=99m in a rush right now. Meanwhile, let me=
 think about it, and I=E2=80=99ll let you know.=E2=80=99 Then he and Jones =
part company.=20
Let us analyze what just happened. Before the two of them met, on whose bac=
k was the =E2=80=98monkey=E2=80=99? The subordinate=E2=80=99s. After they p=
arted, on whose back was it? The manager=E2=80=99s. Subordinate-imposed tim=
e begins the moment a monkey successfully leaps from the back of a subordin=
ate to the back of his or her superior and does not end until the monkey is=
 returned to its proper owner for care and feeding.=20
In accepting the monkey, the manager has voluntarily assumed a position sub=
ordinate to his subordinate. That is, he has allowed Jones to make him her =
subordinate by doing two things a subordinate is generally expected to do f=
or a boss=E2=80=94the manager has accepted a responsibility from his subord=
inate, and the manager has promised her a progress report.=20
The subordinate, to make sure the manager does not miss this point, will la=
ter stick her head in the manager=E2=80=99s office and cheerily query, =E2=
=80=98How=E2=80=99s it coming?=E2=80=99 (This is called supervision.) Or le=
t us imagine in concluding a conference with Johnson, another subordinate, =
the manager=E2=80=99s parting words are, =E2=80=98Fine. Send me a memo on t=
hat.=E2=80=99
Let us analyze this one. The monkey is now on the subordinate=E2=80=99s bac=
k because the next move is his, but it is poised for a leap. Watch that mon=
key. Johnson dutifully writes the requested memo and drops it in his out-ba=
sket. Shortly thereafter, the manager plucks it from his in-basket and read=
s it. Whose move is it now? The manager=E2=80=99s. If he does not make that=
 move soon, he will get a follow-up memo from the subordinate. (This is ano=
ther form of supervision.) The longer the manager delays, the more frustrat=
ed the subordinate will become (he=E2=80=99ll be spinning his wheels) and t=
he more guilty the manager will feel (his backlog of subordinate-imposed ti=
me will be mounting).=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CLast year, when I talked about learning =E2=80=98how to handle bei=
ng sentenced to freedom,=E2=80=99 a phrase I borrowed from Sartre, I meant =
roughly what people these days call =E2=80=98cultivating high agency.=E2=80=
=99 But I need to define my words, since some ways the phrase high agency i=
s used feel foreign to me, and depressing.
Agency, as I see it, is an amalgamation of two skills, or mental dispositio=
ns: autonomy and efficacy.
Agency requires the capacity to formulate autonomous goals in life=E2=80=94=
the capacity to dig inside and figure out what wants to happen through you,=
 no matter how strange or wrong it seems to others. In other words, it requ=
ires autonomy (which was what I was getting at when I said =E2=80=98authent=
ically, and responsibly=E2=80=99).
Agency also requires the ability and willingness to pursue those goals. It =
requires the =E2=80=98will to know,=E2=80=99 the drive to see reality as it=
 is, so you can manipulate it deftly and solve the problems you want to sol=
ve, instead of fooling yourself that certain problems are =E2=80=98unsolvab=
le.=E2=80=99 In other words, efficacy (=E2=80=98handle it effectively=E2=80=
=99).
Or phrased negatively, the opposite of agency can mean one of two things. E=
ither (1) doing what you are =E2=80=98supposed to do,=E2=80=99 playing soci=
al games that do not align with what, on reflection, seems valuable to you =
and/or (2) being passive or ineffective in the face of problems (assuming y=
our problems can=E2=80=99t be solved, that someone else should solve them, =
or working on things that do not in a meaningful way address the problem).
Agency is often framed as a hard-edged, type-A, aggressive approach. But ov=
er the last year, as I=E2=80=99ve been thinking about writing this essay, I=
=E2=80=99ve talked to a lot of highly agentic people, and I=E2=80=99ve read=
 biographies about and interviews with people whose agency I admire and . .=
 . hard-edged does not fit what I=E2=80=99ve seen. Often, agency is almost =
gentle=E2=80=94an attunement to the world and the self, a feeling out the d=
etails of reality, and a finding of the path of least resistance. There is =
sometimes considerable force involved, hard work, but it is like the force =
of a river being pulled toward the sea.=E2=80=9D

(Technically this isn=E2=80=99t an essay, but who cares.)
=E2=80=9CAll of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have goo=
d taste. But it=E2=80=99s like there is this gap. For the first couple year=
s that you=E2=80=99re making stuff, what you=E2=80=99re making isn=E2=80=99=
t so good. It=E2=80=99s not that great. It=E2=80=99s trying to be good, it =
has ambition to be good, but it=E2=80=99s not that good.
But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And =
your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you=E2=80=99re making=
 is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that ph=
ase. They quit.
Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work went through years whe=
re they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were makin=
g wasn=E2=80=99t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. =
Everybody goes through that.
And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you got=
ta know it=E2=80=99s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a=
 lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that =
every week or every month you know you=E2=80=99re going to finish one story=
=2E It is only by going through a vo=
lume of work that you=E2=80=99re going to=
 catch up and close that gap. And the work you=E2=80=99re making will be as=
 good as your ambitions.
I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I=E2=80=99ve ever me=
t. It takes a while. It=E2=80=99s gonna take you a while. It=E2=80=99s norm=
al to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CPretending to learn feels good. Actual learning often feels bad. A=
 lot of people are just pretending to learn (memorizing passwords) when the=
y think they=E2=80=99re learning. [. . .]
A lot of people read whole books just for the feeling of being the type of =
person who reads them, and retain no actual information about the world.
Avoiding playing pretend during your valuable learning time is important an=
d psychologically difficult. A lot of people=E2=80=99s learning is limited =
by their insecurities and need for their social status to be reinforced. It=
 often feels amazing to pretend to learn things, and unpleasant to actually=
 learn. People are drawn to activities that make them feel high status, and=
 repelled from activities that make them feel low status.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CI believe this =E2=80=98more features =3D better=E2=80=99 mindset =
is at the root of the misjudgment, and is also the reason why so many other=
wise smart people are bad at product design (e.g. most open source projects=
). If a MacBook with OSX and no keyboard were really the right product, the=
n Microsoft would have already succeeded with their tablet computer years a=
go. Copying the mistakes of a failed product isn=E2=80=99t a great formula =
for success.
What=E2=80=99s the right approach to new products? Pick three key attribute=
s or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about eve=
rything else. Those three attributes define the fundamental essence and val=
ue of the product=E2=80=94the rest is noise. For example, the original iPod=
 was: (1) small enough to fit in your pocket, (2) had enough storage to hol=
d many hours of music and (3) easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware com=
panies can=E2=80=99t make software, so I bet the others got this wrong). Th=
at=E2=80=99s it=E2=80=94no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the de=
vice, no support for Ogg=E2=80=94nothing but the essentials, well executed.
We took a similar approach when launching Gmail. It was fast, stored all of=
 your email (back when 4MB quotas were the norm), and had an innovative int=
erface based on conversations and search. The secondary and tertiary featur=
es were minimal or absent. There was no =E2=80=98rich text=E2=80=99 compose=
r. The original address book was implemented in two days and did almost not=
hing (the engineer doing the work originally wanted to spend five days on i=
t, but I talked him down to two since I never use that feature anyway). Of =
course those other features can be added or improved later on (and Gmail ha=
s certainly improved a lot since launch), but if the basic product isn=E2=
=80=99t compelling, adding more features won=E2=80=99t save it.
By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are force=
d to find the true essence and value of the product. If your product needs =
=E2=80=98everything=E2=80=99 in order to be good, then it=E2=80=99s probabl=
y not very innovative (though it might be a nice upgrade to an existing pro=
duct). Put another way, if your product is great, it doesn=E2=80=99t need t=
o be good.=E2=80=9D...

=E2=80=9CLet us imagine that a manager is walking down the hall and that he=
 notices one of his subordinates, Jones, coming his way. When the two meet,=
 Jones greets the manager with, =E2=80=98Good morning. By the way, we=E2=80=
=99ve got a problem. You see. . . .=E2=80=99 As Jones continues, the manage=
r recognizes in this problem the two characteristics common to all the prob=
lems his subordinates gratuitously bring to his attention. Namely, the mana=
ger knows (a) enough to get involved, but (b) not enough to make the on-the=
-spot decision expected of him. Eventually, the manager says, =E2=80=98So g=
lad you brought this up. I=E2=80=99m in a rush right now. Meanwhile, let me=
 think about it, and I=E2=80=99ll let you know.=E2=80=99 Then he and Jones =

appened. Before the two of them met, on whose back was the =E2=80=98monkey=
=E2=80=99? The subordinate=E2=80=99s. After they parted, on whose back was =
it? The manager=E2=80=99s. Subordinate-imposed time begins the moment a mon=
key successfully leaps from the back of a subordinate to the back of his or=
 her superior and does not end until the monkey is returned to its proper o=

the monkey, the manager has voluntarily assumed a position subordinate to h=

he manager has promised her a progress report. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =

will later stick her head in the manager=E2=80=99s office and cheerily quer=
y, =E2=80=98How=E2=80=99s it coming?=E2=80=99 (This is called supervision.)=
 Or let us imagine in concluding a conference with Johnson, another subordi=

ne. The monkey is now on the subordinate=E2=80=99s back because the next mo=
ve is his, but it is poised for a leap. Watch that monkey. Johnson dutifull=
y writes the requested memo and drops it in his out-basket. Shortly thereaf=
ter, the manager plucks it from his in-basket and reads it. Whose move is i=
t now? The manager=E2=80=99s. If he does not make that move soon, he will g=
et a follow-up memo from the subordinate. (This is another form of supervis=
ion.) The longer the manager delays, the more frustrated the subordinate wi=
ll become (he=E2=80=99ll be spinning his wheels) and the more guilty the ma=
nager will feel (his backlog of subordinate-imposed time will be mounting).=
