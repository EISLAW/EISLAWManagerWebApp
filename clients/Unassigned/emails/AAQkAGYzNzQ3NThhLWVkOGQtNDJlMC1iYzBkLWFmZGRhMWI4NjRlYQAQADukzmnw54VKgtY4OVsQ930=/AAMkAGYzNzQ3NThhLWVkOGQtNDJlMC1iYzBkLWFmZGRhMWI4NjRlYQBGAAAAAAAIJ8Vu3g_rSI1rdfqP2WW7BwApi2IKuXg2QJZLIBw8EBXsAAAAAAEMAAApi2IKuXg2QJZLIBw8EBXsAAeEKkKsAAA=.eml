How do you actually build a side-gig?=20
I know everyone says that=E2=80=99s the key to success in the age of AI. It=
=E2=80=99s supposed to be good for your career if you=E2=80=99re a junior, =
good for side-income as a senior in your career.=20
It=E2=80=99s supposed to be an unprecedented age for entrepreneurs.
But where do you go to get started? You=E2=80=99re supposed to partner with=
 AI for this stuff=E2=80=94but what does that actually mean day-to-day? Wha=
t prompts do you use? What tools? Who=E2=80=99s done it before?
This guide answers all that, and more. It=E2=80=99s the result of hundreds =
of conversations with builders over the last year. It=E2=80=99s a complete =
kit to help you take advantage of the biggest building opportunity I=E2=80=
=99ve seen in my lifetime.=20
This guide is not theory. It=E2=80=99s not hype. It=E2=80=99s your exact, s=
tep-by-step playbook for 2025:
A strategy framework showing why right now is the shortest, most explosive =
opportunity ever to launch a micro-niche side gig with AI.
15 copy-and-paste AI prompts that run market scans, validate ideas, generat=
e prototypes, and even prepare you for user interviews or investor debates.
The 5-tool stack (Lovable.dev, Outseta, Vercel, Framer, Google Gemini API) =
that turns weekends into working demos=E2=80=94no boilerplate, no team, no =
excuses.
A live case study showing a builder hitting $9K MRR in months, complete wit=
h launch channels, growth tactics, and the mistake they fixed to cut refund=
s in half.
A no-BS FAQ that answers the seven biggest hang-ups=E2=80=94no coding? dist=
ribution? feature creep? AI overwhelm?=E2=80=94with my honest answers as a =
founder.
Five extra build guides from solo founders who actually made real MRR, cove=
ring everything from pricing spreadsheets to solo-founder survival tactics.
You=E2=80=99re wondering what it takes to get started. You=E2=80=99re wonde=
ring if you can do it. You can! I=E2=80=99ve seen it happen over and over a=
gain. Let=E2=80=99s rocket your side gig into orbit.=20
PS. Tell me what you=E2=80=99re building in the comments!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Why side gigs, why now?
AI is everywhere now, and you don=E2=80=99t need a giant team or fancy lab =
to make it work. Big companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic let you p=
lug into their AI engines with a few clicks.=20
That means you can spend a couple of weekends coding up a little tool that =
solves someone=E2=80=99s real problem: like helping small online shops read=
 customer reviews or giving writers quick topic ideas. And then if it click=
s you can start making money fast. You don=E2=80=99t have to wait months to=
 build a team or raise cash. You just find a tiny niche, ship something tha=
t works, and let people pay you for it before the big guys even notice. And=
 if they don=E2=80=99t? Well bet again! Bets are cheap.
There are so many tiny markets out there=E2=80=94like Etsy sellers, local f=
ood bloggers, or student project teams=E2=80=94that big tech never bothers =
to fix. They build one-size-fits-all tools, but you can build exactly what =
those micro-groups need.=20
If you can show just a few people your tool solves their problem, you can g=
et them to pay you. Then you keep improving based on their feedback. It=E2=
=80=99s a perfect time to hack together a side project after school or on w=
eekends, turn it into real cash, and learn tons along the way.
What about distribution?
Distribution is a fancy word for getting your product into people=E2=80=99s=
 hands. And that=E2=80=99s increasingly THE key challenge in the age of AI.
Even the coolest app won=E2=80=99t matter if nobody knows it exists, so you=
 need to nail your distribution plan before you write a single line of code=
=2E=20
Everyone=E2=80=99s building AI tools, and there=E2=80=99s no shortage of op=
tions, which means you can=E2=80=99t rely on =E2=80=9Cbuild it and they wil=
l come.=E2=80=9D Instead, figure out where your future users already hang o=
ut. Think a Discord server for indie game devs or a Reddit community for sc=
hool project groups. Then plan your launch around those spaces.=20
Think about how you=E2=80=99ll grab customer attention with something helpf=
ul, funny, or unique right from day one, whether that=E2=80=99s a free mini=
-demo, a quick how-to video, or an insider tip that solves their pain point=
 immediately.
Once you=E2=80=99ve mapped out your distribution channels, you can tweak yo=
ur product to fit those audiences perfectly, making it easier for your earl=
y fans to become your biggest promoters.=20
Use referral links, community shout-outs, or partnerships with small creato=
rs who already talk to your crowd. This turns your first users into your ma=
rketing team. By prioritizing distribution ahead of product polish, you=E2=
=80=99ll avoid spending weeks building features nobody sees and instead foc=
us on creating something that real people will actually use and share.
One more note here: it really helps to already be a member of the communiti=
es you want to reach. People can smell fake a mile away.
Which AI Model Should I Choose?
Don't overthink this. Seriously. Most people get stuck comparing GPT-5 vs C=
laude Opus 4.1 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro when they should be building their side-gi=
g instead. The truth is, for most micro-niche projects, any decent AI model=
 will work fine. If you already have ChatGPT Plus, use that. If you're budg=
et-conscious, Google Gemini has a generous free tier. If you prefer Claude'=
s writing style, go with Claude. The differences between top models are way=
 smaller than the difference between using AI and not using it at all. (And=
 the good prompts below will help even out those differences.)
Here's what actually matters: don't let AI become your only source of infor=
mation or decision-making. AI is amazing at scaffolding code, generating fi=
rst drafts, and brainstorming ideas, but it can't replace your brain or you=
r real-world knowledge of your micro-niche.=20
You still need to talk to actual users, test your assumptions, and make jud=
gment calls about what features to build and cut. Think of AI as a super-po=
wered intern who's great at the grunt work but needs your direction and ove=
rsight.
The biggest mistake new builders make is asking AI to decide everything=E2=
=80=94which niche to target, what features to add, how to price their produ=
ct. AI doesn't know your market like you do.=20
It can't feel the frustration of your potential users or spot the subtle wo=
rkflow problems that your community complains about in Discord. Use AI to s=
peed up the building and writing, but keep your eyes and ears open to the r=
eal world. That's where the money is.

From Freelancer to $9K MRR Solopreneur in 2025
In the fast-paced world of solopreneurship, few stories capture the essence=
 of rapid execution and niche problem-solving like that of Lean [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/cefcece6-9e9a-4fa4-81fd-a896ed72adc7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=
TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], a former freelance so=
ftware developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. As detailed in Starter Story=
's 2025 profitability report on solopreneurs (updated April 17, 2025), Lean=
 pivoted from inconsistent freelancing gigs to building and launching Sync2=
Sheets=E2=80=94a lightweight SaaS tool that automatically syncs Notion data=
bases with Google Sheets. What started as a personal frustration with manua=
l data transfers exploded into a sustainable business generating $9,000 in =
monthly recurring revenue (MRR) within months of launch, all while operatin=
g solo with minimal overhead.
Background
Lean Zubrezki, a software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, transitio=
ned from freelance development to building Sync2Sheets, a SaaS tool. Previo=
usly earning $3,000=E2=80=93$5,000/month freelancing, he sought stable inco=
me after experiencing burnout from inconsistent client work.
Product
Sync2Sheets is a Google Workspace Add-On that enables real-time bidirection=
al syncing between Notion databases and Google Sheets. It targets soloprene=
urs, small agencies, and teams needing automated data transfers. The tool i=
s listed on the Google Workspace Marketplace with over 70,000 installs and =
is integrated with Notion=E2=80=99s ecosystem.
Development and Launch
Tech Stack: Built using no-code/low-code tools, including Bubble.io and Zap=
ier for core syncing functionality.
Development Time: The MVP was developed in two weeks, focusing on real-time=
 syncing with error handling.
Pricing: Offers a Starter plan at $29/month with a 7-day free trial.
Launch Channels: Promoted via organic outreach on X (@LeanZubrezki, #BuildI=
nPublic threads), Indie Hackers, and Product Hunt. Early X threads (e.g., J=
une 2025) garnered significant engagement.
Growth and Financials
Current Status (July 2025): Achieved $9,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR)=
 with 400=E2=80=93450 paying customers, including agencies like Canva and W=
ix. Annual revenue is approximately $108,000 with 85% gross margins.
Growth Drivers: Organic growth through word-of-mouth, user testimonials on =
X (e.g., June 2025 thread citing $8.4K MRR and 450 customers), and partners=
hips with Notion and Google Workspace ecosystems.
Customer Base: Predominantly US and European users, though exact geographic=
 split is unspecified.
Operational Efficiency: Lean operates solo, spending ~10 hours/week on supp=
ort and updates, with 80% of support automated via Intercom.
Challenges
Technical Issues: Early sync errors with large datasets led to a 15% refund=
 rate, resolved by implementing batch processing.
Competition: Faces competition from tools like Zapier and Airtable integrat=
ions but maintains a niche focus on Notion-Google Sheets syncing.
Key Advice
No big surprise here! As I=E2=80=99ve been calling out throughout this post=
, Lean emphasizes building solutions for personal pain points and iterating=
 based on user feedback, as shared in his Starter Story interview and X pos=
ts.

FAQ: Your Top Questions Answered
Do I need coding skills?
No. You really can do this without code. And that=E2=80=99s becoming more p=
ossible every single month. What you DO need is the old-fashioned stubbornn=
ess coupled with those new AI skills I talk about above (like spotting dist=
ribution advantage).
How do I find my first users?
Seriously, start inside groups you=E2=80=99re already in=E2=80=94Discord, R=
eddit, or school clubs. Share a free demo or helpful tip and invite friends=
 to try it. This is also a product hint=E2=80=94start where you know the pr=
oblem well.=20
My model is giving bad results!
Well first, load it with some more context about you and your goals! And se=
cond, switch models if it still sucks. Models are cheap. Your ability to ex=
ecute quickly is what matters.
When should I stop adding features?
I think it was Chanel that said look in the mirror and take one thing off. =
Well, same goes for product. You should be stopping with features BEFORE yo=
u think you need to, because most people over-build.=20
What=E2=80=99s the most important metric?
Your time-to-value. How much time do you spend on a bet before you can get =
feedback from real customers? If that=E2=80=99s a smaller number, you=E2=80=
=99re gonna get more bets, which is gonna increase your odds of a blowout s=
uccess.=20
How do I pick a price?
Ask a friend to be honest with you and get them to give you an arms-length =
price read. If they squint. Or roll their eyes. Or look at all hesitant=E2=
=80=94your value is too low or the price is too high.=20
What if a big company copies me?
So what. Keep building. Keep distributing. Take it as a compliment!

</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=

little tool that solves someone=E2=80=99s real problem: like helping small =
online shops read customer reviews or giving writers quick topic ideas. And=
 then if it clicks you can start making money fast. You don=E2=80=99t have =

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Don't overthink this. Seriously. Most people get stuck comparing GPT-5=
 vs Claude Opus 4.1 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro when they should be building their si=
de-gig instead. The truth is, for most micro-niche projects, any decent AI =
model will work fine. If you already have ChatGPT Plus, use that. If you're=
 budget-conscious, Google Gemini has a generous free tier. If you prefer Cl=
aude's writing style, go with Claude. The differences between top models ar=
e way smaller than the difference between using AI and not using it at all.=
 (And the good prompts below will help even out those differences.)</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Here's what actually matters: don't let AI become your only source=
 of information or decision-making. AI is amazing at scaffolding code, gene=
rating first drafts, and brainstorming ideas, but it can't replace your bra=
in or your real-world knowledge of your micro-niche. </p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You s=
till need to talk to actual users, test your assumptions, and make judgment=
 calls about what features to build and cut. Think of AI as a super-powered=
 intern who's great at the grunt work but needs your direction and oversigh=
t.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">The biggest mistake new builders make is asking AI to de=
cide everything=E2=80=94which niche to target, what features to add, how to=
 price their product. AI doesn't know your market like you do. </p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">It can't feel the frustration of your potential users or spot the subt=
le workflow problems that your community complains about in Discord. Use AI=
 to speed up the building and writing, but keep your eyes and ears open to =
the real world. That's where the money is.</p><h1 class=3D"header-anchor-po=
