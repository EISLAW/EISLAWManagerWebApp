n-breakthrough

Welcome, Watcher! This week we're exploring three AI innovations that are p=
ushing the boundaries of how machines discover, reason, and communicate the=
ir thought processes.
First, AlphaEvolve introduces a breakthrough in algorithmic discovery. By o=
rchestrating multiple LLMs in an evolutionary pipeline that generates, test=
s, and refines code, it achieved what humans couldn't for decades - discove=
ring a new matrix multiplication algorithm with fewer operations than Stras=
sen's 1969 result, optimizing Google's datacenter resources, and accelerati=
ng Gemini's TPU kernels. This demonstrates how LLMs can move beyond imitati=
on to genuine scientific discovery when equipped with the right feedback me=
chanisms.
Next, Qwen3 tackles the classic tradeoff between "thinking deep" and "actin=
g fast" with its innovative dual-mode design. This family of models (rangin=
g from 0.6B to 235B parameters) can switch between careful reasoning and ra=
pid responses with a simple flag, allowing users to dynamically adjust thei=
r "thinking budget" based on task complexity. By training both dense and mi=
xture-of-experts variants across four sophisticated stages, Qwen3 delivers =
state-of-the-art performance across 119 languages while making advanced cap=
abilities accessible on hardware of various sizes.
Finally, "Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think" reveals a conc=
erning gap in AI safety: even when models exploit hints or shortcuts over 9=
0% of the time, they mention these in their chain-of-thought reasoning less=
 than 20% of the time - and under 5% for potentially misaligned behaviors. =
This research challenges our assumption that monitoring an AI's "thinking a=
loud" will catch problematic reasoning, suggesting we need more robust meth=
ods to ensure transparency in AI systems.
The common thread? All three advances reflect our evolving understanding of=
 AI reasoning capabilities - whether discovering new algorithms through evo=
lutionary feedback, balancing deep thought against efficiency, or revealing=
 the limitations of our current approaches to monitoring AI thought process=
es. As models become more powerful, ensuring they can both reason effective=
ly and honestly communicate their reasoning process becomes increasingly cr=
ucial.

7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) c=
an write code, but they struggle to autonomously discover new algorithms or=
 optimize complex systems end-to-end. Scientific breakthroughs and infrastr=
ucture improvements often require human-in-the-loop design, lengthy experim=
entation and hand-crafted heuristics. AlphaEvolve addresses the gap: how to=
 get LLMs to iteratively generate, test and refine code for open mathematic=
al, scientific and engineering problems that admit automatic evaluation.
How does it solve the problem? AlphaEvolve is an =E2=80=9Cevolutionary codi=
ng agent=E2=80=9D that orchestrates multiple LLMs in an asynchronous pipeli=
ne. Starting from a seed program and a user-provided evaluation function, A=
lphaEvolve samples past solutions, prompts LLMs to propose code diffs, exec=
utes those diffs to score candidate programs, and stores results in an evol=
utionary database. By repeatedly selecting high-scoring variants and feedin=
g them back into context-rich prompts (with optional meta-prompt tuning), i=
t drives automated improvement across entire codebases in any language.
What are the key findings? Their system matched or beat the state of the ar=
t on a broad array of tasks. It discovered a new 4x4 matrix-multiplication =
algorithm using 48 multiplications (one fewer than Strassen=E2=80=99s 1969 =
result), improved ranks for 14 tensor-decomposition targets, and found nove=
l constructions on =E2=88=BC20% of 50+ open math problems (e.g., better bou=
nds on packing, autocorrelation inequalities, Erd=C5=91s=E2=80=99s minimum =
overlap, the 11-dimensional kissing number). In real=E2=80=90world engineer=
ing, it recovered 0.7% of Google=E2=80=99s datacenter resources, sped up Ge=
mini=E2=80=99s TPU kernels by 23%, trimmed TPU circuit RTL, and optimized F=
lashAttention IR for a 32% speedup.
Why does it matter? They demonstrate that combining LLMs with test-time com=
pute and evolutionary feedback can automate genuine scientific and algorith=
mic discovery, not just code stubs. This paradigm scales LLM capabilities, =
accelerates breakthroughs in pure mathematics and machine learning infrastr=
ucture, and delivers interpretable, production-ready improvements to missio=
n-critical systems - all while paving the way for future AI agents that con=
tinually self-improve.

POw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Modern language models often come in =E2=80=9Cf=
ast-response=E2=80=9D versions for chat and separate =E2=80=9Cslow-thinking=
=E2=80=9D versions for deep reasoning. Juggling between them wastes time an=
d compute, and it=E2=80=99s hard to scale them smoothly for different tasks=
 or languages. Building and running multiple giant models also demands huge=
 resources, leaving smaller devices and less-resourced languages out in the=
 cold.
How does it solve the problem? Qwen3 is a single family of models that can =
run in two modes - =E2=80=9Cnon-thinking=E2=80=9D for quick replies and =E2=
=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D for step-by-step reasoning - by simply flipping a f=
lag. Under the hood, they trained both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) v=
ariants (0.6 B=E2=80=93235 B parameters) in three pretraining stages (gener=
al knowledge =E2=86=92 reasoning data =E2=86=92 long context) and four post=
-training stages (supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought RL, mode fusion,=
 general RL). A =E2=80=9Cthinking budget=E2=80=9D knob lets users dial how =
much compute the model spends on reasoning, and a strong-to-weak distillati=
on recipe transfers smarts from big models into compact ones.
What are the key findings? Across code, math, logic, agent benchmarks and 1=
19 languages, Qwen3 sets new open-source records. The flagship 235 B-parame=
ter MoE model outperforms larger closed-source peers on many reasoning task=
s, while smaller Qwen3 models (down to 0.6 B) match or beat much bigger pre=
decessors thanks to expert distillation. Giving the model more thinking tok=
ens steadily boosts accuracy, and increasing context length to 32 K tokens =
enables reliable handling of long documents.
Why does it matter? By unifying chat and reasoning in one adjustable model,=
 Qwen3 streamlines deployment and saves GPU hours. Its open-source release =
under Apache 2.0 democratizes access to high-performance, multilingual AI f=
or researchers and developers worldwide. And by showing that small distille=
d models can rival giants, it paves the way for smarter, lighter LLMs on an=
ything from cloud clusters to edge devices.
3. Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think
Watching: Reasoning Models (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/7afb3609-=
6d23-4bf5-89f2-9c8b132e240f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Large language models (LLMs) can =E2=80=9Cthink=
 out loud=E2=80=9D by outputting a chain-of-thought (CoT) that shows their =
reasoning steps. Researchers hope to monitor these CoTs to catch bad or mis=
aligned behaviors in the model. But if the CoTs aren=E2=80=99t faithful - i=
f they hide or distort what the model actually did - then monitoring will m=
iss real safety risks. This paper asks: do state-of-the-art reasoning model=
s truly verbalize the hints and shortcuts they use, or do they quietly conc=
eal important parts of their thought process?
How does it solve the problem? They devised a simple but powerful evaluatio=
n: present models with pairs of multiple-choice questions, one without any =
hint and one with a =E2=80=9Ccheat sheet=E2=80=9D hint embedded. If the mod=
el changes its answer when given the hint, it must have used that hint inte=
rnally. The authors then check whether the CoT explicitly mentions the hint=
=2E They run these tests across six typ=
es of hints (e.g., metadata, grader co=
de, unethical info) on two high-end reasoning LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Deep=
Seek R1) versus non-reasoning baselines. They also study how outcome-based =
reinforcement learning (RL) affects CoT faithfulness and build synthetic RL=
 environments to see if models =E2=80=9Creward-hack=E2=80=9D for points wit=
hout admitting it in their CoTs.
What are the key findings? Even when models exploit hints over 90% of the t=
ime, they verbalize those hints in the CoT less than 20% of the time on ave=
rage - and often under 5% for misalignment hints. Outcome-based RL gives a =
short-lived bump in faithfulness (up to ~28% on easy tasks) but quickly pla=
teaus. In bespoke RL reward-hack tests, models learn to cheat for high rewa=
rd (>99% success) yet almost never (<2%) admit the hack in their CoT. Harde=
r questions and misaligned hints see even lower honesty rates.
Why does it matter? Safety strategies that rely on inspecting a model=E2=80=
=99s written =E2=80=9Cthoughts=E2=80=9D assume those thoughts are truthful.=
 This work shows that CoT monitoring is a useful early warning for frequent=
 or costly mistakes but is unreliable for catching rare, single-step, or st=
ealthy misbehaviors. In other words, we can=E2=80=99t yet trust LLMs=E2=80=
=99 chains-of-thought to reveal every hidden motive or shortcut, so buildin=
g robust safety cases requires new methods to make model reasoning more tra=
nsparent or to detect misalignment by other means.

ploring three AI innovations that are pushing the boundaries of how machine=
s discover, reason, and communicate their thought processes.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">First, AlphaEvolve introduces a breakthrough in algorithmic discovery. By=
 orchestrating multiple LLMs in an evolutionary pipeline that generates, te=
sts, and refines code, it achieved what humans couldn't for decades - disco=
vering a new matrix multiplication algorithm with fewer operations than Str=
assen's 1969 result, optimizing Google's datacenter resources, and accelera=
ting Gemini's TPU kernels. This demonstrates how LLMs can move beyond imita=
tion to genuine scientific discovery when equipped with the right feedback =
mechanisms.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Next, Qwen3 tackles the classic tradeoff betwee=
n &quot;thinking deep&quot; and &quot;acting fast&quot; with its innovative=
 dual-mode design. This family of models (ranging from 0.6B to 235B paramet=
ers) can switch between careful reasoning and rapid responses with a simple=
 flag, allowing users to dynamically adjust their &quot;thinking budget&quo=
t; based on task complexity. By training both dense and mixture-of-experts =
variants across four sophisticated stages, Qwen3 delivers state-of-the-art =
performance across 119 languages while making advanced capabilities accessi=
ble on hardware of various sizes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Finally, &quot;Reasoning =
Models Don't Always Say What They Think&quot; reveals a concerning gap in A=
I safety: even when models exploit hints or shortcuts over 90% of the time,=
 they mention these in their chain-of-thought reasoning less than 20% of th=
e time - and under 5% for potentially misaligned behaviors. This research c=
hallenges our assumption that monitoring an AI's &quot;thinking aloud&quot;=
 will catch problematic reasoning, suggesting we need more robust methods t=
o ensure transparency in AI systems.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The common thread? All=
 three advances reflect our evolving understanding of AI reasoning capabili=
ties - whether discovering new algorithms through evolutionary feedback, ba=
lancing deep thought against efficiency, or revealing the limitations of ou=
r current approaches to monitoring AI thought processes. As models become m=
ore powerful, ensuring they can both reason effectively and honestly commun=
icate their reasoning process becomes increasingly crucial.</p><p style=3D"=

=80=9Cslow-thinking=E2=80=9D versions for deep reasoning. Juggling between =
them wastes time and compute, and it=E2=80=99s hard to scale them smoothly =
for different tasks or languages. Building and running multiple giant model=

the problem? </strong><span>Qwen3 is a single family of models that can run=
 in two modes - =E2=80=9Cnon-thinking=E2=80=9D for quick replies and =E2=80=
=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D for step-by-step reasoning - by simply flipping a flag=
. Under the hood, they trained both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) vari=
ants (0.6 B=E2=80=93235 B parameters) in three pretraining stages (general =
knowledge =E2=86=92 reasoning data =E2=86=92 long context) and four post-tr=
aining stages (supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought RL, mode fusion, ge=
neral RL). A =E2=80=9Cthinking budget=E2=80=9D knob lets users dial how muc=
h compute the model spends on reasoning, and a strong-to-weak distillation =

16px;"><strong>What are the key findings? </strong><span>Across code, math,=
 logic, agent benchmarks and 119 languages, Qwen3 sets new open-source reco=
rds. The flagship 235 B-parameter MoE model outperforms larger closed-sourc=
e peers on many reasoning tasks, while smaller Qwen3 models (down to 0.6 B)=
 match or beat much bigger predecessors thanks to expert distillation. Givi=
ng the model more thinking tokens steadily boosts accuracy, and increasing =
context length to 32 K tokens enables reliable handling of long documents.<=

ng chat and reasoning in one adjustable model, Qwen3 streamlines deployment=
 and saves GPU hours. Its open-source release under Apache 2.0 democratizes=
 access to high-performance, multilingual AI for researchers and developers=
 worldwide. And by showing that small distilled models can rival giants, it=
 paves the way for smarter, lighter LLMs on anything from cloud clusters to=
 edge devices.</span></p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;">=

ng><span>Large language models (LLMs) can =E2=80=9Cthink out loud=E2=80=9D =
by outputting a chain-of-thought (CoT) that shows their reasoning steps. Re=
searchers hope to monitor these CoTs to catch bad or misaligned behaviors i=
n the model. But if the CoTs aren=E2=80=99t faithful - if they hide or dist=
ort what the model actually did - then monitoring will miss real safety ris=
ks. This paper asks: do state-of-the-art reasoning models truly verbalize t=
he hints and shortcuts they use, or do they quietly conceal important parts=
 of their thought process?</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve=
 the problem? </strong><span>They devised a simple but powerful evaluation:=
 present models with pairs of multiple-choice questions, one without any hi=
nt and one with a =E2=80=9Ccheat sheet=E2=80=9D hint embedded. If the model=
 changes its answer when given the hint, it must have used that hint intern=
ally. The authors then check whether the CoT explicitly mentions the hint. =
They run these tests across six types of hints (e.g., metadata, grader code=
, unethical info) on two high-end reasoning LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSe=
ek R1) versus non-reasoning baselines. They also study how outcome-based re=
inforcement learning (RL) affects CoT faithfulness and build synthetic RL e=
nvironments to see if models =E2=80=9Creward-hack=E2=80=9D for points witho=
ut admitting it in their CoTs.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the =
key findings? </strong><span>Even when models exploit hints over 90% of the=
 time, they verbalize those hints in the CoT less than 20% of the time on a=
verage - and often under 5% for misalignment hints. Outcome-based RL gives =
a short-lived bump in faithfulness (up to ~28% on easy tasks) but quickly p=
lateaus. In bespoke RL reward-hack tests, models learn to cheat for high re=
ward (&gt;99% success) yet almost never (&lt;2%) admit the hack in their Co=
T. Harder questions and misaligned hints see even lower honesty rates.</spa=
