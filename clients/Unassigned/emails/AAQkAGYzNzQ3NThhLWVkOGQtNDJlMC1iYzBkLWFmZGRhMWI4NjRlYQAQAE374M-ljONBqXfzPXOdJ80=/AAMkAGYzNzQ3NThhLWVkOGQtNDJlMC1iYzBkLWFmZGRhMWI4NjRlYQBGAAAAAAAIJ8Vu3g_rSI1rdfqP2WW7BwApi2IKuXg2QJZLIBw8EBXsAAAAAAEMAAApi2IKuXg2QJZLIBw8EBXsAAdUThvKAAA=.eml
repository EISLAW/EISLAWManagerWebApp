US, EUROPE BET ON BANKS TO FUND STRATEGIC PRIORITIES [3]
DEREGULATION IS THE ECONOMIC BACKBONE OF NATO’S NEW STRATEGIC DOCTRINE.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
Both Washington and Brussels are signaling a major break from the regulatory posture that has defined the trans-Atlantic financial architecture since the 2008 global financial crisis. On June 25, the
U.S. Federal Reserve proposed easing capital requirements for large U.S. banks – including a major cut to the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio – one of the most significant rollbacks of
post-crisis safeguards in more than a decade. At the same time, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union delayed and revised key elements of the Basel III framework, including a
postponement of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and changes to liquidity and securitization rules. The EU also made permanent the transitional ratio levels, which were set to increase on
June 28, for certain short-term securities financing transactions. In short, both the U.S. and the EU are aiming to boost lending and market liquidity.
These shifts, announced almost simultaneously with the NATO summit, suggest a coordinated trans-Atlantic move toward a more permissive financial environment. Both sides are grappling with persistently
slower growth, subdued private investment and lingering distortions stemming from the pandemic’s aftermath, including labor market dislocations, volatile inflation and fragile supply chains. In this
context, loosening post-2008 capital constraints is not just a strategic maneuver – it’s an economic necessity.
UNLOCKING INVESTMENT, SUPPORTING NATO
The relaxed rules will enable banks to deploy more capital to priorities that governments alone cannot finance, such as defense production, industrial reshoring, the energy transition and digital
infrastructure. These areas are central to the West’s push for strategic autonomy and are potential engines for growth, jobs and innovation. With limited fiscal space, especially in Europe,
governments are increasingly leaning on banks to bridge the gap between monetary restraint and strategic investment.
In the near term, the deregulation is expected to modestly increase economic activity and liquidity, but it comes amid global headwinds, including intensifying trade disputes. The Fed’s
supplementary leverage ratio proposal aims to allow banks to hold more “safe” assets and facilitate U.S. Treasury securities trading. More broadly, credit conditions could ease as banks allocate
less capital to low-risk assets, freeing up lending capacity for consumers and businesses. This added flexibility could provide a short-term growth boost at a time when global momentum seems to be
stalling.
The timing of these moves – coinciding with the NATO summit in The Hague – is no accident. NATO leaders at the summit endorsed a plan to raise defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic
product by 2035, and both the U.S. and the EU appear to be aligning their financial systems to support that scale of investment. Looser capital rules enable banks to expand their balance sheets,
finance national priorities and underwrite private-sector involvement in areas like defense, energy, critical infrastructure and supply chain resilience. In this light, deregulation is the economic
backbone of NATO’s evolving strategic doctrine.
In the United States, the push is also politically driven. The Trump administration sees current rules as a drag on U.S. competitiveness and a burden on banks that could otherwise fuel growth. The
proposed changes could release more than $200 billion in capital, producing a “regulatory windfall” for large banks. Critics, including some Fed governors, warn the move could increase systemic
risk, especially in this volatile environment marked by trade disputes, falling foreign direct investment and rising government debt.
In the EU, regulators are moving more cautiously but with clear intent. Concerned about competitiveness with the U.S. and Asia, and under pressure to fund the bloc’s defense, energy and digital
priorities, Brussels is easing liquidity standards and delaying stricter trading book rules. This gives banks more flexibility to support cross-border investments and state-led strategic projects. The
move also reflects Europe’s growing recognition that in an era of increased military and economic coercion, economic security and financial mobilization are as vital as military readiness. The
EU’s regulatory adjustments represent another step in its broader effort to reindustrialize and strengthen its defense capacity.
The EU’s determination to unlock funding for defense became clearer in March 2025, when finance ministers approved a plan allowing each country to spend an additional 1.5 percent of GDP annually on
defense for four years without breaching EU deficit limits. If fully used, the so-called escape clause could free up an additional 650 billion euros ($760 billion) in national defense spending,
supplementing a new 150 billion-euro loan facility for joint arms procurement known as the Security Action for Europe. More important, EU officials also updated sustainable finance guidelines to
affirm that defense investments are “compatible with sustainability criteria,” challenging the perception that EU rules prohibit capital flows to the arms sector.
However, if trade tensions escalate, they could undermine the benefits of deregulation. Citing the toll of “the Trump administration’s trade war” on business confidence, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development already cut its global growth forecast for the year to 2.9 percent, down from 3.3 percent in 2024. The U.S. continues to threaten new tariffs on several trade
partners when its 90-day truce expires July 9. If the U.S. and the EU fail to strike a new trade agreement and Washington carries out its threat, Brussels would likely retaliate, further straining
already weak European growth and disrupting supply chains. While looser capital rules could provide short-term stimulus and have already contributed to a weaker dollar and modest euro gains, renewed
tariff battles could reverse those trends, reignite global risk aversion and rattle markets.
In the longer term, prolonged trade wars (or long-term negotiations on commercial policy) could condemn the global economy to a lower growth path regardless of financial deregulation. Higher trade
barriers would fragment international markets, reduce efficiency and force supply chains to adjust, potentially fueling inflation. Even with looser rules, banks could retreat to safer assets or
tighten lending if business conditions deteriorate. Governments could then pile on debt to offset the trade-related economic damage, compounding the fiscal strain.
FACTORING IN RUSSIA AND CHINA
U.S. tariff disputes with China and the EU reflect deeper geopolitical tensions. Both the U.S. and its European allies see China’s growing influence and Russia’s territorial aggression as threats
to the established international order, and the tariff battles are embedded in this broader context. The U.S.-EU relationship has been a cornerstone of international stability, but the future
durability and effectiveness of trans-Atlantic ties will largely depend on how well they can balance their economic, military and diplomatic concerns. The NATO summit provides some hope but also
raises new questions [4].
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already reshaped energy markets and prompted sweeping Western sanctions on the Russian financial and energy sectors. Europe is racing to secure alternative energy
sources, while Washington considers whether to apply more sanctions – contingent on Moscow’s stance toward Iran, its nuclear program and bilateral negotiations. So far, the Kremlin has remained
quiet, and no apparent progress was made in the Trump-Putin phone calls.
Meanwhile, China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and its economic entanglements in Africa [5] and Latin America further complicate the West’s strategic outlook. U.S. and European
economic dependencies on China add another layer of complexity. Their handling of China’s global posture and Russia’s military ambitions will shape the future international order. An effective
response must account for the nuances of Russia and China’s strategic alignment, including their different perceptions of opportunities and vulnerabilities in the face of Western resistance.
Finally, the Middle East remains a critical area of competition for energy, defense and trade. How Russia reacts to regional developments and engages with North Africa will directly affect its broader
relationship with Europe and the United States. Any escalation of conflicts in the region could catalyze a reordering of not only shipping routes but also economic alliances.
For now, the easing of capital rules by the U.S. and the EU is cause for cautious optimism. Amid disagreements on trade and the Russia-Ukraine war, financial market regulation remains an area where
Washington and Brussels can coordinate. But if the U.S. imposes new tariffs on July 9, U.S.-EU relations will hit a new low, market confidence will be badly shaken and recent positive currency moves
could reverse – blunting the impact of looser capital rules. In the long run, Western financial reforms could unlock more lending and investment, but the global economy still faces a hard trade-off
between short-term growth and long-term stability.

 rollbacks of post-crisis safeguards in more than a decade. At the same tim=
e, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union delayed an=
d revised key elements of the Basel III framework, including a postponement=
 of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and changes to liquidity and=
 securitization rules. The EU also made permanent the transitional ratio le=
vels, which were set to increase on June 28, for certain short-term securit=
ies financing transactions. In short, both the U.S. and the EU are aiming t=
o boost lending and market liquidity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These shifts, anno=
unced almost simultaneously with the NATO summit, suggest a coordinated tra=
ns-Atlantic move toward a more permissive financial environment. Both sides=
 are grappling with persistently slower growth, subdued private investment =
and lingering distortions stemming from the pandemic=E2=80=99s aftermath, i=
ncluding labor market dislocations, volatile inflation and fragile supply c=
hains. In this context, loosening post-2008 capital constraints is not just=
 a strategic maneuver =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s an economic necessity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Unlocking =
Investment, Supporting NATO</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The relaxed rules =
will enable banks to deploy more capital to priorities that governments alo=
ne cannot finance, such as defense production, industrial reshoring, the en=
ergy transition and digital infrastructure. These areas are central to the =
West=E2=80=99s push for strategic autonomy and are potential engines for gr=
owth, jobs and innovation. With limited fiscal space, especially in Europe,=
 governments are increasingly leaning on banks to bridge the gap between mo=
netary restraint and strategic investment.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the near term, =
the deregulation is expected to modestly increase economic activity and liq=
uidity, but it comes amid global headwinds, including intensifying trade di=
sputes. The Fed=E2=80=99s supplementary leverage ratio proposal aims to all=
ow banks to hold more =E2=80=9Csafe=E2=80=9D assets and facilitate U.S. Tre=
asury securities trading. More broadly, credit conditions could ease as ban=
ks allocate less capital to low-risk assets, freeing up lending capacity fo=
r consumers and businesses. This added flexibility could provide a short-te=
rm growth boost at a time when global momentum seems to be stalling.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The timing of thes=
e moves =E2=80=93 coinciding with the NATO summit in The Hague =E2=80=93 is=
 no accident. NATO leaders at the summit endorsed a plan to raise defense s=
pending to 5 percent of gross domestic product by 2035, and both the U.S. a=
nd the EU appear to be aligning their financial systems to support that sca=
le of investment. Looser capital rules enable banks to expand their balance=
 sheets, finance national priorities and underwrite private-sector involvem=
ent in areas like defense, energy, critical infrastructure and supply chain=
 resilience. In this light, deregulation is the economic backbone of NATO=
=E2=80=99s evolving strategic doctrine.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the United Stat=
es, the push is also politically driven. The Trump administration sees curr=
ent rules as a drag on U.S. competitiveness and a burden on banks that coul=
d otherwise fuel growth. The proposed changes could release more than $200 =
billion in capital, producing a =E2=80=9Cregulatory windfall=E2=80=9D for l=
arge banks. Critics, including some Fed governors, warn the move could incr=
ease systemic risk, especially in this volatile environment marked by trade=
 disputes, falling foreign direct investment and rising government debt.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the EU, regulat=
ors are moving more cautiously but with clear intent. Concerned about compe=
titiveness with the U.S. and Asia, and under pressure to fund the bloc=E2=
=80=99s defense, energy and digital priorities, Brussels is easing liquidit=
y standards and delaying stricter trading book rules. This gives banks more=
 flexibility to support cross-border investments and state-led strategic pr=
ojects. The move also reflects Europe=E2=80=99s growing recognition that in=
 an era of increased military and economic coercion, economic security and =
financial mobilization are as vital as military readiness. The EU=E2=80=99s=
 regulatory adjustments represent another step in its broader effort to rei=
ndustrialize and strengthen its defense capacity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The EU=E2=80=99s d=
etermination to unlock funding for defense became clearer in March 2025, wh=
en finance ministers approved a plan allowing each country to spend an addi=
tional 1.5 percent of GDP annually on defense for four years without breach=
ing EU deficit limits. If fully used, the so-called escape clause could fre=
e up an additional 650 billion euros ($760 billion) in national defense spe=
nding, supplementing a new 150 billion-euro loan facility for joint arms pr=
ocurement known as the Security Action for Europe. More important, EU offic=
ials also updated sustainable finance guidelines to affirm that defense inv=
estments are =E2=80=9Ccompatible with sustainability criteria,=E2=80=9D cha=
llenging the perception that EU rules prohibit capital flows to the arms se=
ctor.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, if trade =
tensions escalate, they could undermine the benefits of deregulation. Citin=
g the toll of =E2=80=9Cthe Trump administration=E2=80=99s trade war=E2=80=
=9D on business confidence, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and D=
evelopment already cut its global growth forecast for the year to 2.9 perce=
nt, down from 3.3 percent in 2024. The U.S. continues to threaten new tarif=
fs on several trade partners when its 90-day truce expires July 9. If the U=
.S. and the EU fail to strike a new trade agreement and Washington carries =
out its threat, Brussels would likely retaliate, further straining already =
weak European growth and disrupting supply chains. While looser capital rul=
es could provide short-term stimulus and have already contributed to a weak=
er dollar and modest euro gains, renewed tariff battles could reverse those=
 trends, reignite global risk aversion and rattle markets.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the longer term=
, prolonged trade wars (or long-term negotiations on commercial policy) cou=
ld condemn the global economy to a lower growth path regardless of financia=
l deregulation. Higher trade barriers would fragment international markets,=
 reduce efficiency and force supply chains to adjust, potentially fueling i=
nflation. Even with looser rules, banks could retreat to safer assets or ti=
ghten lending if business conditions deteriorate. Governments could then pi=
le on debt to offset the trade-related economic damage, compounding the fis=
cal strain.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Factoring =
in Russia and China</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">U.S. tariff disput=
es with China and the EU reflect deeper geopolitical tensions. Both the U.S=
. and its European allies see China=E2=80=99s growing influence and Russia=
=E2=80=99s territorial aggression as threats to the established internation=
al order, and the tariff battles are embedded in this broader context. The =
U.S.-EU relationship has been a cornerstone of international stability, but=
 the future durability and effectiveness of trans-Atlantic ties will largel=
y depend on how well they can balance their economic, military and diplomat=
ic concerns. The NATO summit provides some hope but also <a href=3D"https:/=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia=E2=80=99s i=
nvasion of Ukraine has already reshaped energy markets and prompted sweepin=
g Western sanctions on the Russian financial and energy sectors. Europe is =
racing to secure alternative energy sources, while Washington considers whe=
ther to apply more sanctions =E2=80=93 contingent on Moscow=E2=80=99s stanc=
e toward Iran, its nuclear program and bilateral negotiations. So far, the =
Kremlin has remained quiet, and no apparent progress was made in the Trump-=
Putin phone calls.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, China=
=E2=80=99s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and <a href=3D"http=

>its economic entanglements in Africa</a> and Latin America further complic=
ate the West=E2=80=99s strategic outlook. U.S. and European economic depend=
encies on China add another layer of complexity. Their handling of China=E2=
=80=99s global posture and Russia=E2=80=99s military ambitions will shape t=
he future international order. An effective response must account for the n=
uances of Russia and China=E2=80=99s strategic alignment, including their d=
ifferent perceptions of opportunities and vulnerabilities in the face of We=
stern resistance.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Finally, the Middl=
e East remains a critical area of competition for energy, defense and trade=
. How Russia reacts to regional developments and engages with North Africa =
will directly affect its broader relationship with Europe and the United St=
ates. Any escalation of conflicts in the region could catalyze a reordering=
 of not only shipping routes but also economic alliances.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For now, the easin=
g of capital rules by the U.S. and the EU is cause for cautious optimism. A=
mid disagreements on trade and the Russia-Ukraine war, financial market reg=
ulation remains an area where Washington and Brussels can coordinate. But i=
f the U.S. imposes new tariffs on July 9, U.S.-EU relations will hit a new =
low, market confidence will be badly shaken and recent positive currency mo=
ves could reverse =E2=80=93 blunting the impact of looser capital rules. In=
 the long run, Western financial reforms could unlock more lending and inve=
stment, but the global economy still faces a hard trade-off between short-t=
erm growth and long-term stability.</p>
