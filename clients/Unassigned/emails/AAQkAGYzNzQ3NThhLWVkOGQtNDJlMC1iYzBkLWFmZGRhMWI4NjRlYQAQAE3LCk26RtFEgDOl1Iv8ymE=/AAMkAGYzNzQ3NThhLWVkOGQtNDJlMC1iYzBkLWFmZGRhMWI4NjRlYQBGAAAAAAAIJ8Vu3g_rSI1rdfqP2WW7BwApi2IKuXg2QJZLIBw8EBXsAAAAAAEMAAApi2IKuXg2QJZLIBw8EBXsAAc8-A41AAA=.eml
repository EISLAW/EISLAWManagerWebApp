DAILY MEMO: TURKEY'S GAS HUB, IRAN'S OFFER TO WASHINGTON [3]
ANKARA'S PLAN APPEARS TO HAVE STALLED FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF A KEY PARTICIPANT.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
GAZPROM PULLS OUT. Russia’s Gazprom is suspending plans to use Turkey as a hub for natural gas supplies to Europe, Bloomberg reported [4]. The project was considered a way for Russian gas to reenter
European markets, but according to the publication, the company now sees it as unfeasible due to Turkey’s limited spare export capacity, Ankara’s hesitation to jointly sell gas with Gazprom, and
an EU proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. According to a Politico report [5], however, France and Belgium (the biggest importers of Russian liquefied natural gas in the EU) have so
far refused to support the bloc’s proposed ban due to the lack of reassurances on the economic and legal ramifications of the move.
IRAN'S OFFER. Iran could be willing to sign a nuclear deal with the U.S. involving the creation of a regional uranium enrichment consortium if the project is located in Iran, Axios reported [6]. The
U.S. has proposed the idea as a way to resolve the impasse in nuclear talks over Iran’s uranium enrichment. The publication also reported that the sixth round of negotiations between the two
countries could be held this weekend in the Middle East.
RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu is in North Korea on Wednesday [7]. He's expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss relations between
their countries. According to Shoigu, the talks will focus on how to implement bilateral agreements and international issues, including the situation in Ukraine. Shoigu was last in the country in
March.
TRIP TO HUNGARY. Milorad Dodik, the president of the Serb-dominated region of Bosnia called Republika Srpska, announced that he will visit Hungary [8] to meet with Prime Minister Viktor Orban and
discuss cooperation on energy and agriculture. Dodik described Hungary as a “natural ally” for Republika Srpska, emphasizing that he wanted to strengthen economic ties with partners who show
mutual understanding and respect.
NO SHOW. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will skip a meeting of the U.S.-led international contact group focused on coordinating support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported [9]. It’s the
first time since the group’s founding three years ago that the top U.S. defense official will not attend one of its summits. U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker is expected to represent
Washington [10] at the gathering, which will include more than 50 defense ministers.
BRITISH AID. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom on Wednesday pledged to supply Ukraine with 100,000 drones [11] by April 2026. By comparison, it delivered just 10,000 drones to Ukraine in the last fiscal
year. The project will cost 350 million British pounds ($474 million) and is part of the U.K.’s commitment to provide 4.5 billion pounds worth of military support to Kyiv this year.
NUCLEAR PROGRAM. Iraq is prepared to launch construction of its first nuclear training reactor, a project developed in cooperation with China, the New Arab news site reported [12]. This comes after
the head of Iraq’s Atomic Energy Commission said last weekend that three former nuclear facilities near Baghdad have been declared free of radioactive residue. He further stated that Baghdad would
sign a deal with the China Atomic Energy Authority to begin work on a nuclear reactor used for research and academic purposes.
RUSSIA'S TAKE. Upcoming NATO exercises in the Baltic Sea are part of the alliance’s preparation for a military clash with Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said [13]. He
called the drills “extremely provocative,” arguing that their size, composition and tasks indicate preparation for “a fight against a comparable enemy.” Some 40 ships, 25 aircraft and 9,000
personnel from 16 NATO states will participate in the drills, which began June 3.
FRESH START. South Korea’s newly elected president Lee Jae-myung was sworn into office Wednesday. Lee pledged to revitalize the economy and unite the country, which had devolved into political
crisis following the impeachment of the former president over his declaration of martial law last December.
NEW REPRESENTATIVE. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met on Tuesday [14] with the new U.S. ambassador to China, David Perdue, in Beijing. Wang urged the two countries to work together to reset
relations, while Perdue expressed his willingness to maintain close communication and support constructive engagement with his Chinese counterparts.
IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Qassem [15] in Beirut to discuss the situation in the region, especially in Gaza. Araghchi
expressed Tehran’s willingness to economically and politically support Lebanon.
CHINA AND JAPAN. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for deeper economic and trade cooperation with Japan [16] during a meeting with a delegation from the Japanese Association for the Promotion of
International Trade in Beijing on Tuesday.
