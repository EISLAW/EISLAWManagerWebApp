Writing a really good guide for Word (docs) was the hardest for me.
That=E2=80=99s because the problem is SO big. We all spend DAYS a week in d=
ocs. Reviewing them. Writing them. Editing them.
And increasingly complaining about them because they=E2=80=99re AI slop.
And that has real consequences=E2=80=94almost every business I know is havi=
ng issues with employees producing AI slop that impedes business decision-m=
aking.
Let me let you in on a secret: the problem is NOT the model. I get asked th=
at all the time. It=E2=80=99s not the model=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the organi=
zation.
Specifically, organizations relied on talented employees to maintain a docu=
ment bar for hundreds of years. That=E2=80=99s gone now.=20
We don=E2=80=99t have a new way to maintain a document bar. And we desperat=
ely need one.=20
That=E2=80=99s why I wrote this. To solve the biggest AI problem in busines=
s: how to scale good business writing.
After hundreds of hours teaching business writing and seeing what works and=
 what doesn=E2=80=99t, I=E2=80=99m sharing a full writing kit for AI here. =
It=E2=80=99s not just for Word. It=E2=80=99s for Google Docs. For Slack. Fo=
r anywhere you have a need for less AI slop and more business writing.
Here=E2=80=99s what you get:
The nine principles of business writing with AI that eliminate slop=20
Every Document Exists to Change Someone=E2=80=99s Mind or Behavior=20
Structure Is a Forcing Function for Thought=20
Constraints Do More Work Than Instructions=20
Quality Scales Through Self-Evaluation, Not Human Review=20
Failure Modes Are More Predictable Than Success=20
You Can=E2=80=99t Prompt Your Way Around Bad Inputs=20
Every Organization=E2=80=99s Documents Sound the Same Unless You Fight It=

Iteration Is About Diagnosis, Not Polishing=20
Documents Don=E2=80=99t Exist in Isolation=E2=80=94They Exist in Workflows=

Eight production-ready prompts built on these principles, plus a quality ev=

SOP / Process Document (standard operating procedure)

This isn=E2=80=99t about finding better AI tools. Every company I work with=
 already has access to models that can write production-quality docs. The p=
roblem is they don=E2=80=99t know how to prompt for it, and they don=E2=80=
=99t know how to scale quality evaluation across their teams.
If your organization is producing AI documents faster than you can evaluate=
 them, if you=E2=80=99re drowning in meeting notes that capture nothing act=
ionable, if your teams are converging on that bland default AI voice=E2=80=
=94this is the methodology that fixes it.
This is how you teach AI to write like your business actually thinks.

LQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
I=E2=80=99ve built a practical framework for business documents that actual=
ly works.
The foundation is nine core principles=E2=80=94things like defining purpose=
 upfront, building in constraints, adding self-checks, and using real input=
s instead of generic templates. I=E2=80=99ve applied these principles to ei=
ght document types that come up constantly: meeting notes, status reports, =
executive briefs, project proposals, PRDs, technical documentation, post-mo=
rtems, and SOPs.
For each document type, you get a complete prompt that embeds these princip=
les. I=E2=80=99ve also included the reasoning behind each prompt=E2=80=99s =
structure, guidance on adapting it to your specific workflow and voice, the=
 common failure modes it=E2=80=99s designed to prevent, and concrete exampl=
es showing what good output looks like compared to the usual AI slop.
The practical result: you draft faster, make clearer decisions, and execute=
 more reliably. The quality checks are built into the prompts themselves, s=
o you catch typical AI errors=E2=80=94vagueness, hallucinated details, miss=
ing context=E2=80=94before anyone else sees them.
I=E2=80=99ve also created a downloadable Business Evaluation Skill that sco=
res any document against these same nine principles. It returns prioritized=
, actionable fixes, so you can both create and systematically improve busin=
ess writing across your team.
Using these prompts with Microsoft Copilot
These prompts work in Copilot, but you=E2=80=99ll need to adapt them slight=
ly.=20
Copilot has access to your Microsoft 365 context=E2=80=94recent emails, doc=

e, and iterate from there. The evaluation skill won=E2=80=99t run directly =
in Copilot, but you can paste its output into a new Copilot session and ask=
 it to score the document.
The Real Problem With Business Writing (And How to Fix It at Scale)
I=E2=80=99ve spent the last six months watching companies drown in their ow=
n documents. Not because people got worse at writing. Not because standards=
 dropped. But because AI made it possible to produce 100x more documents wi=
thout 100x more thinking.
The volume broke the system. And nobody knows how to fix it because we neve=
r needed systematic quality control before. When production was limited by =
human speed, quality control was informal. You knew who the good writers we=
re. You could read their work. You could give feedback. It scaled because p=
roduction scaled slowly.
AI broke that. Production is now nearly infinite. And the old quality contr=
ol system=E2=80=94read everything, give feedback, hope people improve=E2=80=
=94mathematically cannot work anymore.
So here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve learned about what actually matters whe=
n you=E2=80=99re trying to maintain quality at AI-assisted scale. These are=
n=E2=80=99t tips. These are the structural principles that separate organiz=
ations shipping garbage from organizations shipping work that matters.
Part 1: Understanding What Documents Actually Do
Before you can prompt AI to write anything useful, you need to understand w=
hat business documents are actually for. This sounds obvious, but most docu=
ment failures happen because nobody asked the fundamental questions: why do=
es this document exist, and what is it supposed to make happen? These first=
 two principles are about purpose and structure=E2=80=94the foundation ever=
ything else builds on.
Every Document Exists to Change Someone=E2=80=99s Mind or Behavior
This sounds obvious. It=E2=80=99s not.
Most business documents fail because nobody asked =E2=80=9Cwhat is this sup=
posed to make happen?=E2=80=9D before writing it. A status update that does=
n=E2=80=99t surface blockers. A proposal that doesn=E2=80=99t request a dec=
ision. Meeting notes that don=E2=80=99t capture what was decided or who=E2=
=80=99s doing what next. Technical documentation that explains the system b=
ut doesn=E2=80=99t help anyone actually use it.
The first principle is simple: if you can=E2=80=99t articulate what this do=
cument is supposed to make someone do or understand differently, you should=
n=E2=80=99t write it. And if you=E2=80=99re prompting AI to write it, you n=
eed to tell it that purpose explicitly, because AI has no idea why document=
s exist in organizations.
When I review documents that people say =E2=80=9Cfeel like AI wrote them,=
=E2=80=9D the problem is never the prose quality. It=E2=80=99s that the doc=
ument has no theory of change. It explains things. It describes things. It =
analyzes things. But it doesn=E2=80=99t orient the reader toward a decision=
 or action. That=E2=80=99s because the human prompting the AI didn=E2=80=99=
t specify the outcome.
Here=E2=80=99s what this means practically: before you prompt AI to write a=
nything, you need to answer =E2=80=9Cwho reads this and what do they need t=
o do after reading it?=E2=80=9D Not what information do they need. What beh=
avior change or decision does this enable. If you can=E2=80=99t answer that=
, the document is already broken before AI touches it.
Structure Is a Forcing Function for Thought
The second principle: structure is not formatting. Structure is the logic o=
f your argument. And most people confuse the two.
When AI produces that generic five-section document with Introduction, Back=
ground, Analysis, Recommendations, Conclusion=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s not st=
ructure. That=E2=80=99s a template. Templates don=E2=80=99t force you to th=
ink. They let you fill in boxes without developing an actual argument.
Real structure does two things. First, it sequences information in the orde=
r the reader needs it to make a decision. Second, it makes gaps in your thi=
nking visible. If you can=E2=80=99t fill a section, that tells you what you=
 don=E2=80=99t know yet.
Here=E2=80=99s why this matters for AI-assisted writing: when you give AI a=
 template (=E2=80=9Dwrite this in five sections=E2=80=9D), it will happily =
fill every section with content whether or not that content advances an arg=
ument. It will pad. It will include generic transitions. It will create the=
 appearance of completeness while saying nothing.
But when you specify structure as logic=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Dstate the problem,=
 provide three solution options with trade-offs, recommend one with reasoni=
ng, specify what decision you need=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94AI has to actually cons=
truct an argument. The structure forces it to think, the same way it forces=
 humans to think.
I learned this watching product managers prompt AI to write PRDs. The ones =
who said =E2=80=9Cwrite a PRD with these sections: Overview, Requirements, =
Timeline=E2=80=9D got documents that looked like PRDs but contained no actu=
al decisions. The ones who said =E2=80=9Cwrite a PRD that helps engineering=
 answer: what are we building, why, what are the acceptance criteria, what =
are we explicitly not building=E2=80=9D got documents that engineering coul=
d actually use (assuming they gave good inputs).
The structure you specify determines whether AI produces content or clarity=
=2E Most people specify templates and wonder why the output is generic.
Part 2: Controlling AI Generation to Prevent Slop
Once you understand purpose and structure, the next challenge is controllin=
g what AI actually produces. These three principles are about the mechanics=
 of prompting: how to use constraints to force prioritization, how to build=
 quality control into the generation process itself, and how to test for pr=
edictable failures rather than hoping for excellence.
Constraints Do More Work Than Instructions
Third principle: every word you add to a prompt that says =E2=80=9Cinclude =
this=E2=80=9D is less valuable than a word that says =E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t=
 include that.=E2=80=9D
This is counterintuitive. We think prompting is about telling AI what to ge=
nerate. But AI=E2=80=99s default is to be helpful, comprehensive, thorough.=
 It will include everything that might be relevant. The problem isn=E2=80=
=99t getting AI to add more. The problem is getting it to choose.
Constraints force prioritization. When I tell AI =E2=80=9Cwrite this in exa=
ctly 500 words,=E2=80=9D it has to decide what matters most. When I say =E2=
=80=9Cone page maximum,=E2=80=9D it can=E2=80=99t pad. When I say =E2=80=9C=
use only the data I provided, do not infer or estimate,=E2=80=9D it can=E2=
=80=99t fill gaps with plausible-sounding nonsense.
The best document prompts I=E2=80=99ve seen are 70% constraints and 30% ins=
tructions. They spend more words on what not to do than what to do. Because=
 the quality problem in AI-generated writing isn=E2=80=99t that it fails to=
 generate content. It=E2=80=99s that it generates too much content with too=
 little signal.
Here=E2=80=99s how this shows up in practice.=20
Bad prompt: =E2=80=9CWrite an executive brief about this project.=E2=80=9D =
AI will give you five pages analyzing everything.=20
Good prompt: =E2=80=9CWrite a one-page executive brief. First paragraph mus=
t contain the decision request. Include exactly three options. Each option:=
 two sentences maximum. No background section. No conclusion section. End w=
ith your recommendation and the single most important risk.=E2=80=9D
The second prompt forces AI to prioritize. The first prompt allows it to be=
 comprehensive, which in business writing is almost always wrong.
Quality Scales Through Self-Evaluation, Not Human Review
Fourth principle: if your quality control system depends on humans reading =
everything, you=E2=80=99ve already lost.
The math is brutal. If AI lets someone produce 50 documents a week instead =
of 5, and you have 10 people doing this, you now need to review 500 documen=
ts a week instead of 50. Even if you hire more reviewers, you=E2=80=99re ju=
st moving the bottleneck. Review doesn=E2=80=99t scale.
What scales is making the AI review its own work before it gives it to you.=
 This sounds like a trick. It=E2=80=99s not. It=E2=80=99s the only way I=E2=
=80=99ve found that actually works at scale.
Here=E2=80=99s what I mean: before AI outputs a document, make it check its=
 own work against explicit criteria. Not =E2=80=9Cis this good=E2=80=9D but=
 =E2=80=9Cdoes this document contain a decision request in the first paragr=
aph? Are all three options listed? Is each option two sentences or less? Ar=
e there any claims without supporting data? Are there any sections I was to=
ld not to include?=E2=80=9D
When you force AI to self-evaluate against specific criteria, two things ha=
ppen. First, it catches most slop before you see it. Second, it makes the A=
I actually construct the document differently, because it knows it will be =
checked. The same way humans write differently when they know someone will =
review their work carefully.
The organizations I=E2=80=99ve seen successfully maintain quality at AI sca=
le all do some version of this. They don=E2=80=99t try to review everything=
=2E They build self-evaluation into the=
 generation process. The AI becomes it=
s own first-pass reviewer. Then humans spot-check, looking for patterns of =
failure rather than reviewing every document.
This only works if you specify concrete quality criteria. =E2=80=9CIs this =
good=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t work. =E2=80=9CDoes this have specific number=
s with sources=E2=80=9D works. =E2=80=9CIs this clear=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=
=99t work. =E2=80=9CIs every action item assigned to a specific person with=
 a specific deadline=E2=80=9D works. The more concrete your quality checks,=
 the more reliable the self-evaluation.
Failure Modes Are More Predictable Than Success
Fifth principle: you can=E2=80=99t define what makes a great document, but =
you can define what makes a broken one.
Every document type has predictable failure modes. Meeting notes without ac=
tion items. Executive briefs without decision requests. Technical docs that=
 skip steps. Proposals without budgets. Status reports without blockers.
These aren=E2=80=99t style preferences. They=E2=80=99re functional failures=
=2E A meeting note without action it=
ems doesn=E2=80=99t do the job of a meeti=
ng note, which is to ensure follow-through. An executive brief without a de=
cision request doesn=E2=80=99t do the job of an executive brief, which is t=
o get a decision made.
This is the key insight for quality control at scale: you don=E2=80=99t nee=
d AI to recognize great writing. You need it to recognize broken documents.=
 And broken is much easier to define than great.
When I work with companies on this, I have them make a list: what are the f=
ailure modes for each document type we produce regularly? Then we build tho=
se directly into the prompts. Not as aspirations (=E2=80=9Dwrite a great st=
atus report=E2=80=9D) but as checks (=E2=80=9Dafter writing, verify: does t=
his report identify specific blockers? Are they assigned to owners? Is ther=
e a clear ask for help?=E2=80=9D).
This works because broken is objective. You can test for it. Either there=
=E2=80=99s a decision request or there isn=E2=80=99t. Either action items h=
ave owners and deadlines or they don=E2=80=99t. Either technical steps are =
numbered and complete or they=E2=80=99re not.
Great is subjective. Broken is measurable. At scale, you optimize for =E2=
=80=9Cnot broken=E2=80=9D first, and =E2=80=9Cgreat=E2=80=9D is a bonus.
Part 3: Protecting Input Quality and Organizational Voice
The mechanical aspects of prompting matter, but they can=E2=80=99t overcome=
 two deeper problems: bad inputs and voice convergence. These principles ad=
dress what happens before you prompt (ensuring you have real information, n=
ot assumptions) and what happens after repeated AI use (preventing everythi=
ng from sounding the same).
You Can=E2=80=99t Prompt Your Way Around Bad Inputs
Sixth principle: garbage in, garbage out. But it=E2=80=99s more subtle than=
 that.
AI will happily write a comprehensive document from incomplete information.=
 It will fill gaps. It will make reasonable-sounding inferences. It will cr=
eate the appearance of completeness. And you won=E2=80=99t notice until som=
eone tries to act on the document and discovers half the information is pla=
usible fiction.
The best prompt in the world can=E2=80=99t overcome bad inputs. If you=E2=
=80=99re writing a project proposal and you don=E2=80=99t actually know the=
 budget, AI will estimate. If you=E2=80=99re writing meeting notes and you =
don=E2=80=99t have the decisions documented, AI will infer from context. If=
 you=E2=80=99re writing technical documentation and the specs are vague, AI=
 will make reasonable guesses.
This is dangerous because the output looks complete. It has the right struc=
ture. It has the right tone. It passes all your quality checks. But it=E2=
=80=99s built on assumptions, not facts.
I learned this watching a product team use AI to write PRDs. They=E2=80=99d=
 feed it brainstorming notes and customer feedback snippets and ask for a P=
RD. The AI would produce a beautiful document with acceptance criteria, suc=
cess metrics, technical requirements. Engineering would start building, the=
n discover halfway through that the acceptance criteria were never actually=
 agreed to=E2=80=94AI had inferred them from the brainstorming notes.
The principle: before you prompt AI to write anything, you need to verify y=
ou have the actual information required. Not =E2=80=9CI sort of know this=
=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9CI have the specific data, decisions, examples I need=
=2E=E2=80=9D If you don=E2=80=99t, the pro=
mpt should be =E2=80=9Chelp me iden=
tify what information I=E2=80=99m missing=E2=80=9D not =E2=80=9Cwrite the d=
ocument.=E2=80=9D
This means the discipline happens before prompting. You need to know: what =
information does this document type require? Do I have it? If not, what que=
stions do I need to answer first?
Most people skip this step because AI makes it easy to skip. Bad inputs plu=
s good prompts equals confident nonsense.
Every Organization=E2=80=99s Documents Sound the Same Unless You Fight It
Seventh principle: AI has a default voice, and it will eat your organizatio=
n=E2=80=99s voice if you let it.
Here=E2=80=99s what happens: Person A uses AI to write a proposal. Person B=
 uses AI to write a status report. Person C uses AI to write meeting notes.=
 Six months later, every document in your organization has the same cadence=
, the same transitions, the same hedge language, the same generic professio=
nalism.
You lose differentiation. You lose personality. You lose the signal that co=
mes from how people write, not just what they write. Everything starts to s=
ound like it came from the same corporate communications template, even whe=
n it=E2=80=99s coming from engineering, product, and sales.
This isn=E2=80=99t just aesthetics. Voice carries information. When an engi=
neer writes bluntly and a product manager writes diplomatically, that tells=
 you something about certainty levels. When someone=E2=80=99s writing is ca=
reful and qualified, that signals they=E2=80=99re uncertain. When it=E2=80=
=99s direct and specific, that signals confidence. AI=E2=80=99s default voi=
ce is always diplomatically hedge-y, which flattens this signal.
The principle: if you want documents that sound like your organization, you=
 need to either specify voice in every prompt or accept that everything wil=
l sound like generic AI.
I=E2=80=99ve seen two approaches work. First, organizations that develop ex=
plicit voice guidelines=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Dour executive briefs are direct an=
d recommendation-forward, not hedged and analysis-heavy=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94an=
d include those in every prompt. Second, individuals who develop personal v=
oice specs they reuse=E2=80=94=E2=80=9DI write in first person, use short s=
entences, am blunt about problems.=E2=80=9D
What doesn=E2=80=99t work: assuming AI will =E2=80=9Cfigure out=E2=80=9D yo=
ur voice from context. It won=E2=80=99t. It will use its default unless you=
 override it explicitly every time.
This is extra important for external documents. Your marketing should sound=
 like your marketing, not like everyone else=E2=80=99s AI-generated marketi=
ng. Your customer-facing docs should carry your brand voice. If you=E2=80=
=99re not specifying this, you=E2=80=99re converging to generic.
Part 4: Making AI Writing Work in Your Actual Workflow
The final challenge isn=E2=80=99t about individual documents=E2=80=94it=E2=
=80=99s about how documents fit into your organization=E2=80=99s actual wor=
k. These last two principles address iteration (how to improve drafts effic=
iently) and workflow integration (how to make documents that people can act=
ually use in context).
Iteration Is About Diagnosis, Not Polishing
Eighth principle: most people iterate by saying =E2=80=9Cmake it better.=E2=
=80=9D This doesn=E2=80=99t work.
When AI gives you a first draft and something feels off, the instinct is to=
 say =E2=80=9Cimprove this=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cmake it more professional=
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cmake it clearer.=E2=80=9D AI will rewrite the whole t=
hing. You=E2=80=99ll read the rewrite, still feel like something=E2=80=99s =
off, ask for another pass. Three iterations later you have a document that=
=E2=80=99s been fully rewritten but still doesn=E2=80=99t do what you need.
The problem is diagnostic. You haven=E2=80=99t identified what=E2=80=99s ac=
tually wrong. You just know something doesn=E2=80=99t feel right. And AI ca=
n=E2=80=99t diagnose that for you=E2=80=94it will just try variations until=
 you=E2=80=99re satisfied, which is an inefficient way to find the problem.
The principle: effective iteration requires specific diagnosis before the n=
ext prompt.
Here=E2=80=99s what this looks like in practice. First draft comes back and=
 something feels wrong. Before you prompt for changes, you need to articula=
te: what specific thing is broken? Is it that Section 2 is too long? Is it =
that the examples are generic? Is it that the tone is too formal? Is it tha=
t there=E2=80=99s no clear recommendation? Is it that the structure is illo=
gical?
Once you can name the problem specifically, you can fix it specifically. =
=E2=80=9CSection 2 is too long=E2=80=94cut it from 400 to 200 words by remo=
ving the background context and keeping only the three main points.=E2=80=
=9D That gets you a targeted fix. =E2=80=9CMake it better=E2=80=9D gets you=
 a rewrite.
This is hard because diagnosis is the actual skill. Anyone can tell when a =
document doesn=E2=80=99t work. Knowing why it doesn=E2=80=99t work and what=
 specific change would fix it=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s expertise. And AI does=
n=E2=80=99t remove the need for that expertise. It just makes the cost of n=
ot having it more expensive, because you waste iterations.
The organizations I=E2=80=99ve seen succeed at AI-assisted writing have peo=
ple who can read a draft and quickly identify the specific failure. Not =E2=
=80=9Cthis feels off=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Cthis has no decision request, Se=
ction 3 makes claims without data, and the conclusion is vague.=E2=80=9D Th=
en they can iterate efficiently.
If you can=E2=80=99t diagnose specifically, you end up in rewrite loops. An=
d at some point it=E2=80=99s faster to just write it yourself.
Documents Don=E2=80=99t Exist in Isolation=E2=80=94They Exist in Workflows
Ninth principle: most people prompt AI to write individual documents. They =
should be prompting AI to write documents that fit into their organization=
=E2=80=99s actual workflow.
Here=E2=80=99s what I mean. A status report isn=E2=80=99t just information.=
 It=E2=80=99s an input to a decision process. Someone reads it, escalates b=
lockers, reallocates resources, updates roadmaps. If the status report does=
n=E2=80=99t surface information in the format that decision process needs, =
it doesn=E2=80=99t matter how well-written it is.
Meeting notes aren=E2=80=99t just a record. They=E2=80=99re supposed to ens=
ure follow-through. If your organization tracks action items in Asana, and =
your meeting notes format doesn=E2=80=99t match what you can easily import =
into Asana, you=E2=80=99ve created friction. People won=E2=80=99t follow th=
rough.
Technical documentation isn=E2=80=99t just explanation. It=E2=80=99s suppos=
ed to help someone solve a problem. If your docs don=E2=80=99t match how pe=
ople actually troubleshoot=E2=80=94if they=E2=80=99re organized by feature =
when people search by error message=E2=80=94they don=E2=80=99t work no matt=
er how complete they are.
The principle: before you prompt AI to write a document, you need to know h=
ow that document is used in your organization=E2=80=99s workflow. Who reads=
 it? What do they do with it? What format makes that easier?
This shows up in subtle ways. Some organizations make decisions in meetings=
 and need notes that are action-oriented. Others make decisions async in do=
cs and need notes that are context-heavy. If you prompt AI to write =E2=80=
=9Cmeeting notes=E2=80=9D without specifying which workflow you=E2=80=99re =
in, you=E2=80=99ll get generic notes that don=E2=80=99t serve either purpos=
e well.
The best document prompts I=E2=80=99ve seen include workflow context. =E2=
=80=9CWrite status report formatted for our Monday standup review, where we=
 track blockers by owner and escalate anything over 3 days old.=E2=80=9D Th=
at tells AI not just what information to include, but how to structure it f=
or actual use.
Most people skip this because they think of documents as standalone artifac=
ts. But documents are tools in workflows. And if the tool doesn=E2=80=99t f=
it the workflow, it doesn=E2=80=99t matter how good the tool is.
The Real Skill Is Knowing What to Specify
The meta-principle underneath all of this: the bottleneck in AI-assisted wr=
iting isn=E2=80=99t AI capability. It=E2=80=99s human ability to articulate=
 what they actually want.
Most people prompt AI the way they brief junior employees: vaguely, assumin=
g the AI will figure out what they meant. But AI can=E2=80=99t read your mi=
nd. It can=E2=80=99t infer your standards. It doesn=E2=80=99t know what mat=
ters in your organization.
Every time someone shows me a bad AI-generated document, the problem is in =
the prompt (by which I mean the prompt and/or the inputs that are part of t=
he prompt). They said =E2=80=9Cwrite a status report=E2=80=9D when they mea=
nt =E2=80=9Cwrite a status report that surfaces blockers, assigns them to o=
wners, and makes a specific ask for help=E2=80=94here=E2=80=99s your info.=
=E2=80=9D They said =E2=80=9Cwrite meeting notes=E2=80=9D when they meant =
=E2=80=9Cwrite meeting notes that document decisions with decision-makers a=
nd action items with owners and deadlines=E2=80=94here=E2=80=99s my transcr=
ipt.=E2=80=9D
The gap between what people say and what they mean is where quality dies. A=
nd AI forces that gap into the open. With humans, you could be vague becaus=
e they=E2=80=99d ask clarifying questions. With AI, vague prompts get vague=
 output, and people blame the AI.
But here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve learned: forcing yourself to be specif=
ic enough to prompt AI well makes you better at knowing what you actually w=
ant. It makes you better at writing yourself. It makes you better at giving=
 feedback to humans. Because it forces you to articulate your quality stand=
ards explicitly instead of relying on =E2=80=9CI know it when I see it.=E2=
=80=9D
The organizations that succeed at AI-assisted writing aren=E2=80=99t the on=
es with the best writers. They=E2=80=99re the ones with the clearest standa=
rds. They know what makes a document work in their context. They can articu=
late it concretely. They can test for it systematically.
That=E2=80=99s the real work. Not prompting AI. Knowing what you=E2=80=99re=
 trying to produce clearly enough that you can specify it.

=E2=80=99s that the document has no theory of change. It explains things. I=

en you give AI a template (=E2=80=9Dwrite this in five sections=E2=80=9D), =
it will happily fill every section with content whether or not that content=
 advances an argument. It will pad. It will include generic transitions. It=

 is brutal. If AI lets someone produce 50 documents a week instead of 5, an=
d you have 10 people doing this, you now need to review 500 documents a wee=

teria, two things happen. First, it catches most slop before you see it. Se=
cond, it makes the AI actually construct the document differently, because =
it knows it will be checked. The same way humans write differently when the=
y know someone will review their work carefully.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=

some version of this. They don=E2=80=99t try to review everything. They bui=

: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Ninth principle: most p=
eople prompt AI to write individual documents. They should be prompting AI =
to write documents that fit into their organization=E2=80=99s actual workfl=
ow.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">Here=E2=80=99s what I mean. A status report isn=E2=80=
=99t just information. It=E2=80=99s an input to a decision process. Someone=
 reads it, escalates blockers, reallocates resources, updates roadmaps. If =
the status report doesn=E2=80=99t surface information in the format that de=
cision process needs, it doesn=E2=80=99t matter how well-written it is.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Meeting notes aren=E2=80=99t just a record. They=E2=80=99re su=
pposed to ensure follow-through. If your organization tracks action items i=
n Asana, and your meeting notes format doesn=E2=80=99t match what you can e=
asily import into Asana, you=E2=80=99ve created friction. People won=E2=80=
=99t follow through.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Technical documentation isn=E2=80=99t =
just explanation. It=E2=80=99s supposed to help someone solve a problem. If=
 your docs don=E2=80=99t match how people actually troubleshoot=E2=80=94if =
they=E2=80=99re organized by feature when people search by error message=E2=
=80=94they don=E2=80=99t work no matter how complete they are.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The principle: before you prompt AI to write a document, you need to k=
now how that document is used in your organization=E2=80=99s workflow. Who =
reads it? What do they do with it? What format makes that easier?</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">This shows up in subtle ways. Some organizations make decisions in m=
eetings and need notes that are action-oriented. Others make decisions asyn=
c in docs and need notes that are context-heavy. If you prompt AI to write =
=E2=80=9Cmeeting notes=E2=80=9D without specifying which workflow you=E2=80=
=99re in, you=E2=80=99ll get generic notes that don=E2=80=99t serve either =
purpose well.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The best document prompts I=E2=80=99ve seen i=
nclude workflow context. =E2=80=9CWrite status report formatted for our Mon=
day standup review, where we track blockers by owner and escalate anything =
over 3 days old.=E2=80=9D That tells AI not just what information to includ=
e, but how to structure it for actual use.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Most people skip=
 this because they think of documents as standalone artifacts. But document=
s are tools in workflows. And if the tool doesn=E2=80=99t fit the workflow,=
 it doesn=E2=80=99t matter how good the tool is.</p><div style=3D"font-size=

l of this: the bottleneck in AI-assisted writing isn=E2=80=99t AI capabilit=
y. It=E2=80=99s human ability to articulate what they actually want.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">Most people prompt AI the way they brief junior employees: vaguel=
y, assuming the AI will figure out what they meant. But AI can=E2=80=99t re=
ad your mind. It can=E2=80=99t infer your standards. It doesn=E2=80=99t kno=
w what matters in your organization.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Every time someone sho=
ws me a bad AI-generated document, the problem is in the prompt (by which I=
 mean the prompt and/or the inputs that are part of the prompt). They said =
=E2=80=9Cwrite a status report=E2=80=9D when they meant =E2=80=9Cwrite a st=

6px;">The gap between what people say and what they mean is where quality d=
ies. And AI forces that gap into the open. With humans, you could be vague =
because they=E2=80=99d ask clarifying questions. With AI, vague prompts get=
 vague output, and people blame the AI.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here=E2=80=99s =
what I=E2=80=99ve learned: forcing yourself to be specific enough to prompt=
 AI well makes you better at knowing what you actually want. It makes you b=
etter at writing yourself. It makes you better at giving feedback to humans=
. Because it forces you to articulate your quality standards explicitly ins=
tead of relying on =E2=80=9CI know it when I see it.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The organizations that succeed at AI-assisted writing aren=E2=80=99t t=
he ones with the best writers. They=E2=80=99re the ones with the clearest s=
tandards. They know what makes a document work in their context. They can a=
rticulate it concretely. They can test for it systematically.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
