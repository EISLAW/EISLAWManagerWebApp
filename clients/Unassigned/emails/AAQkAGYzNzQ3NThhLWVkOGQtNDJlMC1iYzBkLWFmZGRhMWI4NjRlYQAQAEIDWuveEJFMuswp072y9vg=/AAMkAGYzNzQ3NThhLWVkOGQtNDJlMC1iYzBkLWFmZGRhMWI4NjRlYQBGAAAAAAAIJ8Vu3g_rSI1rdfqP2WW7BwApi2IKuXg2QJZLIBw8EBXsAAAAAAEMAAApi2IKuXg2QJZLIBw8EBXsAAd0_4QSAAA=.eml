This is not another Taylor Swift post. This is a post about how AI is accel=
erating the end of a 20 year status quo in marketing, and what to do next. =
Even if you don=E2=80=99t work in marketing, this matters.
Because in the age of AI, we=E2=80=99re all gonna have to get better at mar=
keting (at least) ourselves and our careers. The marketing paradox applies =
to all of us, and the strategies I outline here work for all of us too.=20
Because the current reality is unsustainable for everybody. It shows up in =
the job market (where we market ourselves). It shows up in marketing campai=
gns. The hard truth is AI is commodifying all the levers of marketing faste=
r than I can write about it.=20
We can all create incredible videos now. The strategy that you have for tra=
nsforming your marketing into an AI powerhouse is probably cut-and-paste wh=
at everyone else in your vertical is using. Same tools, same results (same =
bat time, same bat channel [ https://substack.com/redirect/b77c61ac-359c-40=

xQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for those of you from the TV era).=20
TLDR; there is no alpha in chasing tools to the bottom, and the 20 year mar=
keting optimization status quo is starting to crack. This post is about wha=
t=E2=80=99s breaking and a way forward for marketers=E2=80=94whether you=E2=
=80=99re marketing yourself, your indie hacked startup, or you=E2=80=99re d=
riving (or influencing) marketing strategy for a company.
In the next 18 months, every competitor will have access to AI that can gen=
erate Super Bowl-quality video for $2,000. Perfect product shots, flawless =
testimonials, and controversy-calibrated campaigns at the push of a button.=
 The same tools that cost six figures today will be free tomorrow.

When everyone can create perfect content for nothing, what's actually worth=
 something?
I've spent the last few months studying this shift. The Sydney Sweeney Amer=
ican Eagle controversy that generated 47 million views. The Taylor Swift de=
epfakes. Then of course the explosion of AI-generated ads that have that cr=
azy wild anything-can-happen vibe. They're not isolated incidents. They're =
symptoms of a 20-year-old marketing optimization strategy that's finally br=
eaking apart.
Marketing has been stuck in what=E2=80=99s called a local maxima=E2=80=94we=
've optimized ourselves into a corner where we're really good at one thing =
(driving engagement) but nobody has the tools or local incentives to break =
the status quo and evolve to something better. AI isn't just accelerating t=
his problem. It's accelerating it so fast that the whole system is about to=
 collapse.
That's actually good news if you understand what's happening.
There's a window right now=E2=80=94maybe 18 months=E2=80=94where understand=
ing this shift provides real competitive advantage. The smartest brands are=
 already moving, but quietly. They're not buying more AI tools. They're bui=
lding what AI can't replicate.
Here's what's actually happening, why it breaks everything we know about ma=
rketing optimization, and what replaces engagement as the metric that matte=
rs.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
AI Is Speeding Up Marketing's Race to the Bottom (And Why That's the Way Ou=
t)
We've been stuck optimizing for engagement for 20 years. AI just made the t=
rap visible.
The convergence of AI and marketing reveals a system optimized into a corne=
r. This exploration connects local maxima, algorithmic optimization, and ce=
lebrity culture to explain why Sydney Sweeney's calculated controversy, Tay=
lor Swift deepfakes, and $2,000 AI-generated ads that look like million-dol=
lar productions aren't separate phenomena=E2=80=94they're symptoms of the s=
ame system disease.
AI marketing is exploding. Approximately 40% of the Instagram feed is now A=
I-generated content, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Meta is invest=
ing heavily in AI tooling, recently publishing a billion-parameter artifici=
al brain designed to measure user responses to videos and simulate them to =
create more targeted AI videos. These aren't just videos that might appeal =
to users=E2=80=94they're videos specifically engineered to trigger particul=
ar psychological responses.
Digital ads that cost a million dollars just a few years ago now cost a ten=
th of that price or less, with costs continuing to decline. Major brands ar=
e jumping on the AI-generated ad stream, and we can expect a significant sh=
are of Super Bowl 2026 advertisements to be AI-generated, at least in part.
Understanding this transformation requires grasping the concept of local ma=
xima and how it applies to marketing optimization.
Understanding Local Maxima
In optimization algorithms, systems use gradient descent to improve perform=
ance. The system evaluates its current position, examines every possible sm=
all change, and selects the modification that most improves its target metr=
ic. This process resembles adjusting thousands of radio knobs simultaneousl=
y to achieve the clearest signal.
The fundamental problem emerges when the system reaches a point where every=
 small adjustment degrades performance. Any slight turn of any knob worsens=
 the metric, leading the algorithm to conclude it has found the optimal sol=
ution. However, this represents only a local maxima. Superior solutions may=
 exist, but reaching them would require dramatically different settings acr=
oss all parameters. The algorithm cannot perceive these alternatives becaus=
e it can only evaluate incremental changes.
Marketing has been trapped in a local maxima for approximately two decades.
Since social media's emergence, the industry has optimized relentlessly for=
 engagement. Every small adjustment, A/B test, and algorithm tweak has push=
ed toward more clicks, extended time on site, and heightened emotional resp=
onse. The gradient descent of marketing optimization has led to a specific =
destination: controversial, emotionally manipulative, attention-grabbing co=
ntent that exploits human psychology.
The industry believes it has optimized marketing. Instead, it has optimized=
 itself into a corner.
The System We Built
The Sydney Sweeney American Eagle campaign exemplifies where this optimizat=
ion has led. The brand deliberately courted controversy with "genes/jeans" =
wordplay=E2=80=94featuring a blonde, blue-eyed actress discussing inherited=
 traits while modeling denim. CMO Craig Brommers admitted the campaign was =
designed to "push buttons."
This strategy isn't new. It mirrors the Brooke Shields Calvin Klein adverti=
sements from the 1990s. Jeans are ubiquitous=E2=80=94everyone owns jeans. T=
o market them effectively, brands must venture into controversy to differen=
tiate themselves in a saturated market.
The difference now: AI makes this playbook trivially easy to execute. Brand=
s can A/B test controversy at machine speed, generate thousands of variatio=
ns until finding the perfect provocation, and model exactly which psycholog=
ical triggers to activate for specific audience segments. The technology fo=
r creating advertisements and manufacturing controversy is converging while=
 becoming dramatically cheaper.
Taylor Swift deepfakes represent the other side of this convergence. While =
deepfakes aren't new and aren't limited to Taylor Swift, her status as a pr=
ominent female celebrity creates special prevalence and visibility. Journal=
ists routinely use Taylor Swift as a test case when investigating AI system=
 safety, generating immediate global headlines when new features like Grok =
could theoretically create inappropriate images of her.
Testing this phenomenon directly on Midjourney reveals the current reality:=
 AI-generated images of Taylor Swift in concert are indistinguishable from =
authentic photographer shots. Without context, determining whether an image=
 represents an artistic photograph from an actual concert or complete fabri=
cation becomes impossible. This represents our current reality: the inabili=
ty to distinguish artificial tokens from authentic ones in advertising and =
other contexts.
The third element is the uncanny valley problem. Generation Z consistently =
expresses concern about authenticity in studies, yet they struggle equally =
to differentiate between high-quality AI-generated material and authentic c=
ontent. This isn't generational=E2=80=94none of us can reliably make this d=
istinction anymore. This inability to distinguish real from fake is acceler=
ating dramatically.
The Four Feedback Loops
AI systems are creating evolutionary pressure on human content creation. Ar=
tificial authenticity is beginning to outcompete genuine authenticity in al=
gorithmic environments. This isn't happening through conscious design=E2=80=
=94it's emerging through four accelerating feedback loops.
Sampling feedback loops
Controversial content receives broader distribution and creates training da=
ta biased toward more controversy. The Sydney Sweeney case demonstrates thi=
s precisely. The feedback loop samples successful content. Controversial co=
ntent performs better in feeds, so the system generates more controversial =
content to accelerate this effect.
Society has broadly discussed how social media rewards outrage, but we have=
n't adequately addressed AI as an accelerant for this phenomenon. AI accele=
rates controversial content production by making it easier and cheaper to c=
reate. This reinforces the training data loop for algorithms. Every success=
ful controversial campaign becomes training data for the next generation of=
 AI tools, teaching them that controversy equals success.
This means we're literally training AI systems on datasets already biased t=
oward manipulation and controversy. The AI isn't learning to create effecti=
ve advertisements=E2=80=94it's learning to create controversial ones, becau=
se the data demonstrates controversy works.
Feature feedback loops
User engagement with content creates algorithmic features. User engagement =
with manipulative content teaches algorithms that manipulation equals quali=
ty. This feedback loop isn't new, but AI accelerates it because AI produces=
 content more likely to generate engagement=E2=80=94content humans are more=
 likely to engage with.
Humans cannot distinguish the difference, returning to the uncanny valley c=
oncept. We cannot tell, so we click and engage, feeding both the content al=
gorithm that serves us material and teaching marketers that AI works effect=
ively. Every click becomes a vote for more of the same.
What's particularly insidious: we're not just training the algorithms=E2=80=
=94we're training ourselves. Our engagement patterns become the features de=
fining "good" content for the system. If we rage-click on controversial con=
tent, the system learns that rage-clicking signals positive response. If we=
 share deepfakes because they're shocking, the system learns that shock val=
ue equals virality.
Individual feedback loops
Repeated exposure to optimized content changes our behavior and expectation=
s. Extensive research documents how Instagram feeds affect self-image and s=
ocial relationships. But this extends to parasocial relationships as well.
Much of the Taylor Swift phenomenon involves people believing they have a r=
ight to a relationship with her, even if it's fabricated in their minds. Th=
is isn't unique to Taylor Swift=E2=80=94it's the nature of modern celebrity=
=2E But AI is industrializing it.
Character AI and other AI companionship applications generate over $220 mil=
lion annually with rapid growth. They cultivate parasocial relationships wh=
ile allowing users to create their own characters. Users create the charact=
ers they'll have artificial relationships with. Traditional parasocial rela=
tionships at least involved real humans. Now we're forming emotional bonds =
with entities that never existed.
In both cases, AI accelerates this individual feedback loop, changing behav=
ior and expectations based on engagement patterns. We're being trained to a=
ccept artificial relationships as real, to prefer manufactured intimacy ove=
r genuine connection.
Outcome feedback loops
Successful AI content running through these feedback loops becomes the base=
line for normal content. AI content isn't just changing what we consume and=
 what appears in our feeds=E2=80=94it's changing how we create authentic vi=
deo content.
Extensive research has examined how Hollywood filmmaking has shifted over t=
he past 20-25 years with CGI. Similarly, authentic content creation=E2=80=
=94whether movies, advertisements, or marketing assets=E2=80=94is changing =
because of AI. We haven't fully processed this transformation, but we'll se=
e shifts in camera angles, expectations for special effects capabilities, a=
nd expectations for integrating real people versus obviously artificial one=
s versus deepfakes so convincing we cannot distinguish them from humans.
We are reshaping the baseline of normal in our movies and advertisements th=
rough our interactions. The artificial becomes the template for the real. T=
his represents perhaps the most profound feedback loop because even "authen=
tic" content begins mimicking AI-generated content. Reality starts imitatin=
g artificiality.
Emergent Behaviors Nobody Programmed
These four feedback loops=E2=80=94controversial content receiving more dist=
ribution, user engagement with manipulative content teaching algorithms tha=
t manipulation equals quality, repeated exposure changing our behavior, and=
 outcomes reshaping our expectations of non-AI content=E2=80=94feed on each=
 other while being accelerated by AI.
This produces emergent behaviors that nobody programmed.
This isn't about evil marketers conspiring to poison America or the world w=
ith their advertisements. That's a popular misconception. Having worked as =
a marketer with amazing marketing teams, that's simply not how marketers op=
erate.
Instead, consider emergent behaviors in a system that is, as established fr=
om the beginning, locally optimized=E2=80=94a local maxima system. What we =
have is emergent optimization effectively designed to adapt human psycholog=
ical conditioning to AI content.
To restate this clearly: AI systems optimizing for engagement inadvertently=
 optimize human psychology for engagement with AI content. Nobody wants thi=
s outcome, but this is what we've achieved.
This represents the throughline connecting Sydney Sweeney, Taylor Swift, th=
e uncanny valley, and parasocial relationships. The core thesis: our AI sys=
tems, built on top of engagement-optimized systems, are essentially adaptin=
g our psychology to engage with AI content.
This creates a profound problem. As marketers and brands, we claim to value=
 authenticity. Humans buying products say they value authenticity. Between =
them, disintermediating that relationship, is an AI marketing system that v=
alues artificiality. It values what's fake.
Why the Local Maxima Will Break
The local maxima won't hold forever, and this represents good news: AI inte=
lligence and tooling continue becoming cheaper, meaning every brand will be=
 able to create fantastic, unusual videos constantly.
We're approaching tremendous content flooding=E2=80=94all very high quality=
 and all very AI-generated. The volume will exceed human consumption capaci=
ty. This creates a massive signal-to-noise problem. People won't be able to=
 find meaningful signal.
Consider what happens when every brand can generate perfect controversy for=
 pennies. When every company can create deepfake testimonials. When every p=
roduct can have AI-generated social proof. The very optimization that creat=
ed this situation=E2=80=94engagement through manipulation=E2=80=94becomes w=
orthless when everyone has access to it.
This resembles an arms race where everyone acquires nuclear weapons simulta=
neously. Suddenly, the weapons don't provide advantages anymore. They just =
ensure mutual destruction.
This is already beginning. The cost of creating commercials that would have=
 required million-dollar budgets is approaching zero. Kalshi produced a Sup=
er Bowl-quality advertisement for $2,000 in 48 hours using AI. Coign create=
d the financial industry's first fully AI-generated commercial at 1% of tra=
ditional cost. When everyone can do this, what provides differentiation?
What Can't Be Faked
The path through this involves brands emphasizing what cannot be faked with=
 AI. The music industry provides an interesting example.
Consider Taylor Swift's new album launch. When Taylor Swift announced it on=
 August 12th, she blurred the album image. This wasn't just for suspense. S=
he values easter eggs and controlling her marketing narrative, and the live=
 podcast blur likely ensured any AI fakes circulating afterward would be im=
mediately, obviously fake. Taylor's strategy suggests that one path forward=
 involves directly owning distribution and marketing. But Taylor's approach=
 isn't just defensive. She's also pre-selling physical media. Vinyl is expe=
riencing a significant comeback, and she's pre-selling the album vinyls.
Vinyls cannot be faked. They're real. You can touch them, hold them. This p=
artially explains their comeback. One way good brands can cut through the n=
oise involves doubling down on physical experiences that humans cannot obta=
in any other way.
AI cannot provide a vinyl of the Taylor Swift album in the same way that Ta=
ylor mailing the album on the correct date provides an irreplaceable human =
experience of opening the package and receiving the vinyl. This maintains a=
uthenticity that holds long-term customer value in a world where numerous b=
rands demand attention.
This extends far beyond music. Whiskey distilleries are returning to physic=
al customer proximity, offering distillery tours and special tasting rooms.=
 For brands outside luxury goods, physical store footprints are evolving. W=
hile malls are no longer dominant in the US, and the controversy Sydney Swe=
eney courted with the jeans advertisement was primarily designed to drive a=
ttention and traffic to the American Eagle website for conversion, the key =
insight remains: if that's your strategy, you want to provide in-person exp=
eriences that leave people wanting to return for experiences they cannot ge=
t elsewhere.
The problem with controversy marketing (like American Eagle's approach) is =
that it buys stock price increases and attention. It undoubtedly generates =
sales=E2=80=94controversy works. But this approach doesn't necessarily tran=
slate into long-term customer value. For sustainable long-term customer val=
ue, which ultimately sustains free cash flows and business valuation, brand=
s must figure out how to move people from AI spaces into physical spaces.
Physical experiences engage our complete senses=E2=80=94smell, touch, all t=
he elements that make us register authentic experiences. They help build br=
and community with other human consumers. This builds those long-term custo=
mer relationships. Notice Taylor didn't just create one vinyl=E2=80=94she c=
reated multiple special editions with posters, really leaning into the phys=
ical aspect.
Brands can have fun with this. They can make it hybrid and online simultane=
ously. They can create Instagrammable moments, Instagram walls with special=
 logos. But they still need that irreplaceable human touch.
The Irreplaceability of Human Touch
As consumers begin demanding authenticity as a differentiator, we'll start =
seeing some kind of certificate of human touch in brand offerings.
The exact form remains unclear, but we can examine how the beauty industry =
has handled authenticity over the past 20 years and how beauty marketing ha=
s shifted accordingly. The journey from airbrushed perfection to celebratin=
g real skin, real bodies, real faces took two decades in beauty. It's about=
 to happen in 18 months everywhere else.
Similarly, we'll see marketing that leans into authentically portrayed huma=
n experiences. Marketing that says, "This is a real human. We didn't AI-enh=
ance their face." Marketing that says, "This is a real car. A piece of it j=
ust fell off. We didn't pretend."
This will become increasingly common as a way to signal to consumers in a s=
ea of AI content that you are worth attention. An anti-AI signal will emerg=
e because AI content is becoming so cheap and easy to produce.
This isn't about nostalgia or luddism. It's about scarcity. When perfect be=
comes cheap, imperfect becomes valuable. When artificial is everywhere, aut=
hentic becomes luxury. When everything can be faked, the unfakeable becomes=
 priceless.
Three Additional Ways Forward
Beyond emphasizing physical experiences and certificates of human touch, br=
ands have three other strategic paths for escaping the engagement-optimizat=
ion trap.
Radical Transparency as Differentiation
When AI can manufacture perfect narratives, radical transparency becomes a =
competitive advantage. This means showing the actual process=E2=80=94the fa=
ilures, the iterations, the human decisions behind the brand. While AI can =
generate flawless origin stories, it cannot replicate the messy reality of =
how things actually get made.
Patagonia exemplifies this approach by documenting their supply chain chall=
enges, environmental impact calculations, and internal debates about busine=
ss decisions. When they tell customers not to buy their jacket unless they =
need it, the counterintuitive honesty cuts through the noise precisely beca=
use it cannot be algorithmically optimized. No AI system would recommend te=
lling customers not to buy your product.
This extends beyond environmental messaging. Software companies can show th=
eir actual debugging processes, their failed feature launches, their custom=
er complaint resolution. Food brands can document their recipe development =
failures alongside successes. The vulnerability of admitting "we tried this=
 and it didn't work" becomes valuable precisely because AI systems are trai=
ned to present success narratives.
The key insight: AI optimizes for perfection, but human psychology often tr=
usts imperfection more. When every brand can present a perfect story, the b=
rand that shows its real story=E2=80=94with all the contradictions and comp=
romises=E2=80=94becomes memorable.
Community Co-Creation Over Broadcasting
The traditional marketing model broadcasts messages to audiences. AI amplif=
ies this by enabling personalized broadcasting at scale. But genuine commun=
ity co-creation cannot be automated because it requires real-time human jud=
gment, empathy, and the ability to navigate complex social dynamics.
LEGO's Ideas platform demonstrates this approach. Instead of just marketing=
 to LEGO fans, they've created a system where fans design sets, vote on con=
cepts, and help shape the product line. The community doesn't just consume =
LEGO content=E2=80=94they create it. This relationship cannot be replicated=
 by AI because it requires ongoing human negotiation, compromise, and colla=
borative decision-making.
This approach works across industries. Beauty brands can involve customers =
in shade development. Software companies can make users genuine partners in=
 feature prioritization. Food brands can let communities vote on new flavor=
s while sharing the actual development process.
The crucial difference from traditional focus groups or surveys: the commun=
ity becomes genuinely invested in outcomes because they're co-creators, not=
 just consulted consumers. AI can facilitate these interactions, but it can=
not replace the human investment that emerges from genuine collaborative cr=
eation.
Temporal Authenticity and Real-Time Experiences
AI excels at creating content that can be infinitely reproduced and optimiz=
ed. But experiences that exist only in specific moments, that cannot be sav=
ed or replicated, create a different kind of value. This isn't just about l=
ive events=E2=80=94it's about creating meaning through temporal scarcity.
Clubhouse, before it became a victim of 2020 valuation pops, demonstrated t=
his principle. Conversations happened in real-time and disappeared. The ina=
bility to replay or optimize these interactions created a different quality=
 of attention and engagement. While Clubhouse ultimately failed to maintain=
 this uniqueness, the principle remains sound.
Brands can create temporal authenticity through live problem-solving sessio=
ns, real-time design processes, or time-limited collaborative projects. The=
 value comes not from the perfect execution but from the shared experience =
of working through something together in real-time, with all the uncertaint=
y that entails.
A restaurant might broadcast their actual prep process live each morning, t=
aking suggestions and adapting in real-time. A design studio might solve cl=
ient problems live, showing the actual thinking process. A musician might c=
ompose in real-time based on audience input. These experiences cannot be op=
timized because they're happening now, with real constraints and real uncer=
tainty.
The temporal element is crucial: these experiences lose their meaning if th=
ey're recorded and packaged. The value comes from being present for somethi=
ng that's happening once, with real stakes and real consequences.
AI Is Speeding Up Marketing's Race to the Bottom (And Why That's the Way Ou=
t)
We've been stuck optimizing for engagement for 20 years. AI just made the t=
rap visible.
The convergence of AI and marketing reveals a system optimized into a corne=
r. This exploration connects local maxima, algorithmic optimization, and ce=
lebrity culture to explain why Sydney Sweeney's calculated controversy, Tay=
lor Swift deepfakes, and $2,000 AI-generated ads that look like million-dol=
lar productions aren't separate phenomena=E2=80=94they're symptoms of the s=
ame system disease.
AI marketing is exploding. Approximately 40% of the Instagram feed is now A=
I-generated content, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Meta is invest=
ing heavily in AI tooling, recently publishing a billion-parameter artifici=
al brain designed to measure user responses to videos and simulate them to =
create more targeted AI videos. These aren't just videos that might appeal =
to users=E2=80=94they're videos specifically engineered to trigger particul=
ar psychological responses.
Digital ads that cost a million dollars just a few years ago now cost a ten=
th of that price or less, with costs continuing to decline. Major brands ar=
e jumping on the AI-generated ad stream, and we can expect a significant sh=
are of Super Bowl 2026 advertisements to be AI-generated, at least in part.
Understanding this transformation requires grasping the concept of local ma=
xima and how it applies to marketing optimization.
Understanding Local Maxima
In optimization algorithms, systems use gradient descent to improve perform=
ance. The system evaluates its current position, examines every possible sm=
all change, and selects the modification that most improves its target metr=
ic. This process resembles adjusting thousands of radio knobs simultaneousl=
y to achieve the clearest signal.
The fundamental problem emerges when the system reaches a point where every=
 small adjustment degrades performance. Any slight turn of any knob worsens=
 the metric, leading the algorithm to conclude it has found the optimal sol=
ution. However, this represents only a local maxima. Superior solutions may=
 exist, but reaching them would require dramatically different settings acr=
oss all parameters. The algorithm cannot perceive these alternatives becaus=
e it can only evaluate incremental changes.
Marketing has been trapped in a local maxima for approximately two decades.
Since social media's emergence, the industry has optimized relentlessly for=
 engagement. Every small adjustment, A/B test, and algorithm tweak has push=
ed toward more clicks, extended time on site, and heightened emotional resp=
onse. The gradient descent of marketing optimization has led to a specific =
destination: controversial, emotionally manipulative, attention-grabbing co=
ntent that exploits human psychology.
The industry believes it has optimized marketing. Instead, it has optimized=
 itself into a corner.
The System We Built
The Sydney Sweeney American Eagle campaign exemplifies where this optimizat=
ion has led. The brand deliberately courted controversy with "genes/jeans" =
wordplay=E2=80=94featuring a blonde, blue-eyed actress discussing inherited=
 traits while modeling denim. CMO Craig Brommers admitted the campaign was =
designed to "push buttons."
This strategy isn't new. It mirrors the Brooke Shields Calvin Klein adverti=
sements from the 1990s. Jeans are ubiquitous=E2=80=94everyone owns jeans. T=
o market them effectively, brands must venture into controversy to differen=
tiate themselves in a saturated market.
The difference now: AI makes this playbook trivially easy to execute. Brand=
s can A/B test controversy at machine speed, generate thousands of variatio=
ns until finding the perfect provocation, and model exactly which psycholog=
ical triggers to activate for specific audience segments. The technology fo=
r creating advertisements and manufacturing controversy is converging while=
 becoming dramatically cheaper.
Taylor Swift deepfakes represent the other side of this convergence. While =
deepfakes aren't new and aren't limited to Taylor Swift, her status as a pr=
ominent female celebrity creates special prevalence and visibility. Journal=
ists routinely use Taylor Swift as a test case when investigating AI system=
 safety, generating immediate global headlines when new features like Grok =
could theoretically create inappropriate images of her.
Testing this phenomenon directly on Midjourney reveals the current reality:=
 AI-generated images of Taylor Swift in concert are indistinguishable from =
authentic photographer shots. Without context, determining whether an image=
 represents an artistic photograph from an actual concert or complete fabri=
cation becomes impossible. This represents our current reality: the inabili=
ty to distinguish artificial tokens from authentic ones in advertising and =
other contexts.
The third element is the uncanny valley problem. Generation Z consistently =
expresses concern about authenticity in studies, yet they struggle equally =
to differentiate between high-quality AI-generated material and authentic c=
ontent. This isn't generational=E2=80=94none of us can reliably make this d=

g real skin, real bodies, real faces took two decades in beauty. It's about=
 to happen in 18 months everywhere else.
Similarly, we'll see marketing that leans into authentically portrayed huma=
n experiences. Marketing that says, "This is a real human. We didn't AI-enh=
ance their face." Marketing that says, "This is a real car. A piece of it j=
ust fell off. We didn't pretend."
This will become increasingly common as a way to signal to consumers in a s=
ea of AI content that you are worth attention. An anti-AI signal will emerg=
e because AI content is becoming so cheap and easy to produce.
This isn't about nostalgia or luddism. It's about scarcity. When perfect be=
comes cheap, imperfect becomes valuable. When artificial is everywhere, aut=
hentic becomes luxury. When everything can be faked, the unfakeable becomes=
 priceless.
Three Additional Ways Forward
Beyond emphasizing physical experiences and certificates of human touch, br=
ands have three other strategic paths for escaping the engagement-optimizat=
ion trap.
Radical Transparency as Differentiation
When AI can manufacture perfect narratives, radical transparency becomes a =
competitive advantage. This means showing the actual process=E2=80=94the fa=
ilures, the iterations, the human decisions behind the brand. While AI can =
generate flawless origin stories, it cannot replicate the messy reality of =
how things actually get made.
Patagonia exemplifies this approach by documenting their supply chain chall=
enges, environmental impact calculations, and internal debates about busine=
ss decisions. When they tell customers not to buy their jacket unless they =
need it, the counterintuitive honesty cuts through the noise precisely beca=
use it cannot be algorithmically optimized. No AI system would recommend te=
lling customers not to buy your product.
This extends beyond environmental messaging. Software companies can show th=
eir actual debugging processes, their failed feature launches, their custom=
er complaint resolution. Food brands can document their recipe development =
failures alongside successes. The vulnerability of admitting "we tried this=
 and it didn't work" becomes valuable precisely because AI systems are trai=
ned to present success narratives.
The key insight: AI optimizes for perfection, but human psychology often tr=
usts imperfection more. When every brand can present a perfect story, the b=
rand that shows its real story=E2=80=94with all the contradictions and comp=
romises=E2=80=94becomes memorable.
Community Co-Creation Over Broadcasting
The traditional marketing model broadcasts messages to audiences. AI amplif=
ies this by enabling personalized broadcasting at scale. But genuine commun=
ity co-creation cannot be automated because it requires real-time human jud=
gment, empathy, and the ability to navigate complex social dynamics.
LEGO's Ideas platform demonstrates this approach. Instead of just marketing=
 to LEGO fans, they've created a system where fans design sets, vote on con=
cepts, and help shape the product line. The community doesn't just consume =
LEGO content=E2=80=94they create it. This relationship cannot be replicated=
 by AI because it requires ongoing human negotiation, compromise, and colla=
borative decision-making.
This approach works across industries. Beauty brands can involve customers =
in shade development. Software companies can make users genuine partners in=
 feature prioritization. Food brands can let communities vote on new flavor=
s while sharing the actual development process.
The crucial difference from traditional focus groups or surveys: the commun=
ity becomes genuinely invested in outcomes because they're co-creators, not=
 just consulted consumers. AI can facilitate these interactions, but it can=
not replace the human investment that emerges from genuine collaborative cr=
eation.
Temporal Authenticity and Real-Time Experiences
AI excels at creating content that can be infinitely reproduced and optimiz=
ed. But experiences that exist only in specific moments, that cannot be sav=
ed or replicated, create a different kind of value. This isn't just about l=
ive events=E2=80=94it's about creating meaning through temporal scarcity.
Clubhouse, before it became commoditized, demonstrated this principle. Conv=
ersations happened in real-time and disappeared. The inability to replay or=
 optimize these interactions created a different quality of attention and e=
ngagement. While Clubhouse ultimately failed to maintain this uniqueness, t=
he principle remains sound.
Brands can create temporal authenticity through live problem-solving sessio=
ns, real-time design processes, or time-limited collaborative projects. The=
 value comes not from the perfect execution but from the shared experience =
of working through something together in real-time, with all the uncertaint=
y that entails.
A restaurant might broadcast their actual prep process live each morning, t=
aking suggestions and adapting in real-time. A design studio might solve cl=
ient problems live, showing the actual thinking process. A musician might c=
ompose in real-time based on audience input. These experiences cannot be op=
timized because they're happening now, with real constraints and real uncer=
tainty.
The temporal element is crucial: these experiences lose their meaning if th=
ey're recorded and packaged. The value comes from being present for somethi=
ng that's happening once, with real stakes and real consequences.
A Personal Marketing Aside: Applying This to Your Job Search
If you're marketing yourself=E2=80=94in job searches, freelance work, or bu=
ilding a personal brand=E2=80=94these same principles apply with particular=
 urgency. The job market is being flooded with AI-optimized resumes, AI-wri=
tten cover letters, and AI-generated portfolios. Standing out requires emph=
asizing what AI cannot replicate about you.
Your unfakeable elements aren't your skills listed on LinkedIn=E2=80=94thos=
e can be copied. They're your specific problem-solving approaches, your par=
ticular way of thinking through challenges, and your real work process. Ins=
tead of listing "managed cross-functional teams," document a specific insta=
nce where you navigated a real conflict between departments, including what=
 didn't work the first time.
Create temporal authenticity in your job search. Offer to solve a real prob=
lem for the company during the interview process=E2=80=94not spec work, but=
 genuine thinking through their actual challenges in real-time. Most candid=
ates optimize their presentation for the interview. Instead, demonstrate yo=
ur actual thinking process, including the dead ends and reconsiderations.
Build genuine community around your expertise. Rather than broadcasting you=
r qualifications, engage in real problem-solving in professional communitie=
s. Help people work through challenges in your field without immediately po=
sitioning yourself for opportunities. This cannot be replicated by AI becau=
se it requires sustained human judgment and genuine care about outcomes bey=
ond your own advancement.
Most importantly, resist the urge to optimize your personal brand for algor=
ithmic engagement. The same feedback loops that trap marketing also trap pe=
rsonal branding. The LinkedIn post that gets 10,000 likes but says nothing =
meaningful about your actual capabilities is a local maxima. The hiring man=
ager who eventually matters isn't looking for viral content=E2=80=94they're=
 looking for evidence of genuine competence and trustworthy judgment.
Document your real work process, including the unsuccessful approaches. Sho=
w your actual thinking, not your polished conclusions. Engage in genuine pr=
ofessional relationships rather than networking optimization. These approac=
hes take longer but create the kind of professional reputation that survive=
s algorithmic changes and stands out in an AI-saturated market.

What Builders Are Missing
For AI tool builders creating marketing solutions: most development has foc=
used on the toolchain for producing advertisements. You've been building cl=
eaner, simpler pathways from idea to advertisement. That pathway is fairly =
well-established.
There's significant untapped space in using AI to help marketers exercise g=
ood taste and judgment regarding optimal long-term brand positioning and th=
e best long-term positioning for particular ad campaigns that support the b=
rand.
Precious little AI work has addressed the connection between content, brand=
ing, and long-term strategy. LLMs are becoming sophisticated enough to serv=
e as thought partners on this. But nobody is thinking about what happens wh=
en AI can produce 1,000 ideas and you have to select one.
This represents the real market gap. We've solved the production problem. W=
e've made content creation trivially easy. But we haven't solved the judgme=
nt problem. We haven't built tools that help marketers decide what's worth =
creating in the first place.
When you can generate 1,000 advertisement variations in an hour, the bottle=
neck isn't creation anymore=E2=80=94it's curation. It's taste. It's underst=
anding which of those 1,000 options actually serves the brand's long-term i=
nterests versus just generating short-term engagement.
The Path Forward
We can build our way out of, and market our way out of, the local maxima we=
're in. We don't have to tolerate our current algorithmic experience. We ca=
n build our way out.
We don't have to tolerate a world where everyone can be deepfaked, not just=
 celebrities like Taylor Swift. We can implement guardrails. But the key to=
 achieving this is our willingness to think more deliberately about how we =
want AI to integrate into our marketing.
This is the heart of the question. If we have a local maxima, we must be mo=
re intentional with our AI usage and the way we cultivate long-term brand r=
elationships. This is up to us as consumers to demand. It's also up to mark=
eters, and it's up to builders who equip marketers with tools to think more=
 intentionally.
The local maxima we're in isn't permanent. In fact, AI is accelerating us t=
oward its breaking point. When everyone has the same AI tools, when everyon=
e can create perfect content, when everyone can optimize for the same metri=
cs=E2=80=94the optimization stops working. The local maxima collapses under=
 its own weight.
This might be exactly what we need. We might need the system to break befor=
e we can build something better. We might need content to become so artific=
ially perfect that we crave the imperfect. We might need relationships to b=
ecome so synthetic that we value the genuine.
The brands that understand this shift=E2=80=94that start building for what =
comes after the local maxima breaks=E2=80=94will own the next 20 years. Not=
 because they rejected AI, but because they understood what AI makes valuab=
le: everything it can't do.
Physical presence. Human judgment. Real community. Genuine imperfection. Th=
e smell of a store. The texture of a product. The irreplaceable experience =
of being somewhere with someone, doing something that can't be downloaded, =
generated, or faked.
That's not going backward. That's going forward to something we haven't bui=
lt yet. That's the real opportunity hiding in this crisis.
The question isn't whether this transformation will happen. It's whether yo=
ur brand will be ready when it does. The local maxima is breaking. What are=
 you building for what comes next?

roves its target metric. This process resembles adjusting thousands of radi=

fundamental problem emerges when the system reaches a point where every sma=

 metric, leading the algorithm to conclude it has found the optimal solutio=
n. However, this represents only a local maxima. Superior solutions may exi=
st, but reaching them would require dramatically different settings across =
all parameters. The algorithm cannot perceive these alternatives because it=
 can only evaluate incremental changes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=

merican Eagle campaign exemplifies where this optimization has led. The bra=

=E2=80=94featuring a blonde, blue-eyed actress discussing inherited traits =

Taylor Swift deepfakes represent the other side of this convergence. While =
deepfakes aren't new and aren't limited to Taylor Swift, her status as a pr=
ominent female celebrity creates special prevalence and visibility. Journal=

 safety, generating immediate global headlines when new features like Grok =
could theoretically create inappropriate images of her.</p><p style=3D"marg=

-generated images of Taylor Swift in concert are indistinguishable from aut=
hentic photographer shots. Without context, determining whether an image re=
presents an artistic photograph from an actual concert or complete fabricat=

teresting example.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Consider Taylor Swift's new album launch=
. When Taylor Swift announced it on August 12th, she blurred the album imag=
e. This wasn't just for suspense. She values easter eggs and controlling he=
r marketing narrative, and the live podcast blur likely ensured any AI fake=
s circulating afterward would be immediately, obviously fake. Taylor's stra=
tegy suggests that one path forward involves directly owning distribution a=
nd marketing. But Taylor's approach isn't just defensive. She's also pre-se=
lling physical media. Vinyl is experiencing a significant comeback, and she=
's pre-selling the album vinyls.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=

 that Taylor mailing the album on the correct date provides an irreplaceabl=

goods, physical store footprints are evolving. While malls are no longer do=
minant in the US, and the controversy Sydney Sweeney courted with the jeans=
 advertisement was primarily designed to drive attention and traffic to the=
 American Eagle website for conversion, the key insight remains: if that's =
your strategy, you want to provide in-person experiences that leave people =
wanting to return for experiences they cannot get elsewhere.</p><p style=3D=

 a perfect story, the brand that shows its real story=E2=80=94with all the =

>Community Co-Creation Over Broadcasting</h3><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The traditional m=
arketing model broadcasts messages to audiences. AI amplifies this by enabl=
ing personalized broadcasting at scale. But genuine community co-creation c=
annot be automated because it requires real-time human judgment, empathy, a=
nd the ability to navigate complex social dynamics.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">LEGO's =
Ideas platform demonstrates this approach. Instead of just marketing to LEG=
O fans, they've created a system where fans design sets, vote on concepts, =
and help shape the product line. The community doesn't just consume LEGO co=
ntent=E2=80=94they create it. This relationship cannot be replicated by AI =
because it requires ongoing human negotiation, compromise, and collaborativ=
e decision-making.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This approach works across industries. B=
eauty brands can involve customers in shade development. Software companies=
 can make users genuine partners in feature prioritization. Food brands can=
 let communities vote on new flavors while sharing the actual development p=
rocess.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">The crucial difference from traditional focus group=
s or surveys: the community becomes genuinely invested in outcomes because =
they're co-creators, not just consulted consumers. AI can facilitate these =
interactions, but it cannot replace the human investment that emerges from =
genuine collaborative creation.</p><h3 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

nd Real-Time Experiences</h3><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">AI excels at creating content tha=
t can be infinitely reproduced and optimized. But experiences that exist on=
ly in specific moments, that cannot be saved or replicated, create a differ=
ent kind of value. This isn't just about live events=E2=80=94it's about cre=
ating meaning through temporal scarcity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Clubhouse, before =
it became commoditized, demonstrated this principle. Conversations happened=
 in real-time and disappeared. The inability to replay or optimize these in=
teractions created a different quality of attention and engagement. While C=
lubhouse ultimately failed to maintain this uniqueness, the principle remai=
ns sound.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Brands can create temporal authenticity through l=
ive problem-solving sessions, real-time design processes, or time-limited c=
ollaborative projects. The value comes not from the perfect execution but f=
rom the shared experience of working through something together in real-tim=
e, with all the uncertainty that entails.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">A restaurant migh=
t broadcast their actual prep process live each morning, taking suggestions=
 and adapting in real-time. A design studio might solve client problems liv=
e, showing the actual thinking process. A musician might compose in real-ti=
me based on audience input. These experiences cannot be optimized because t=

something that's happening once, with real stakes and real consequences.</p=

=94those can be copied. They're your specific problem-solving approaches, y=
our particular way of thinking through challenges, and your real work proce=
ss. Instead of listing &quot;managed cross-functional teams,&quot; document=
 a specific instance where you navigated a real conflict between department=
s, including what didn't work the first time.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

ompany during the interview process=E2=80=94not spec work, but genuine thin=
king through their actual challenges in real-time. Most candidates optimize=
 their presentation for the interview. Instead, demonstrate your actual thi=

"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">Build genuine community around your expertise. Rather than broadcasting y=
our qualifications, engage in real problem-solving in professional communit=
ies. Help people work through challenges in your field without immediately =
positioning yourself for opportunities. This cannot be replicated by AI bec=
ause it requires sustained human judgment and genuine care about outcomes b=
eyond your own advancement.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Most importantly, resist the ur=
ge to optimize your personal brand for algorithmic engagement. The same fee=
dback loops that trap marketing also trap personal branding. The LinkedIn p=
ost that gets 10,000 likes but says nothing meaningful about your actual ca=
pabilities is a local maxima. The hiring manager who eventually matters isn=
't looking for viral content=E2=80=94they're looking for evidence of genuin=
e competence and trustworthy judgment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=

hips rather than networking optimization. These approaches take longer but =
create the kind of professional reputation that survives algorithmic change=

4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For AI tool builders creating =
marketing solutions: most development has focused on the toolchain for prod=
ucing advertisements. You've been building cleaner, simpler pathways from i=
dea to advertisement. That pathway is fairly well-established.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">There's significant untapped space in using AI to help marketers exerc=
ise good taste and judgment regarding optimal long-term brand positioning a=
nd the best long-term positioning for particular ad campaigns that support =
the brand.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Precious little AI work has addressed the connec=
tion between content, branding, and long-term strategy. LLMs are becoming s=
ophisticated enough to serve as thought partners on this. But nobody is thi=
nking about what happens when AI can produce 1,000 ideas and you have to se=
lect one.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This represents the real market gap. We've solved=
 the production problem. We've made content creation trivially easy. But we=
 haven't solved the judgment problem. We haven't built tools that help mark=
eters decide what's worth creating in the first place.</p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When=
 you can generate 1,000 advertisement variations in an hour, the bottleneck=
 isn't creation anymore=E2=80=94it's curation. It's taste. It's understandi=
ng which of those 1,000 options actually serves the brand's long-term inter=
ests versus just generating short-term engagement.</p><h2 class=3D"header-a=

th Forward</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We can build our way out of, and market our way=
 out of, the local maxima we're in. We don't have to tolerate our current a=
lgorithmic experience. We can build our way out.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We don't h=
ave to tolerate a world where everyone can be deepfaked, not just celebriti=
es like Taylor Swift. We can implement guardrails. But the key to achieving=
 this is our willingness to think more deliberately about how we want AI to=
 integrate into our marketing.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is the heart of the que=
stion. If we have a local maxima, we must be more intentional with our AI u=
sage and the way we cultivate long-term brand relationships. This is up to =
us as consumers to demand. It's also up to marketers, and it's up to builde=
rs who equip marketers with tools to think more intentionally.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The local maxima we're in isn't permanent. In fact, AI is accelerating=
 us toward its breaking point. When everyone has the same AI tools, when ev=
eryone can create perfect content, when everyone can optimize for the same =
metrics=E2=80=94the optimization stops working. The local maxima collapses =
under its own weight.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This might be exactly what we need. W=
e might need the system to break before we can build something better. We m=
ight need content to become so artificially perfect that we crave the imper=
fect. We might need relationships to become so synthetic that we value the =
genuine.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The brands that understand this shift=E2=80=94that=
 start building for what comes after the local maxima breaks=E2=80=94will o=
wn the next 20 years. Not because they rejected AI, but because they unders=
tood what AI makes valuable: everything it can't do.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Physic=
al presence. Human judgment. Real community. Genuine imperfection. The smel=
l of a store. The texture of a product. The irreplaceable experience of bei=
ng somewhere with someone, doing something that can't be downloaded, genera=
ted, or faked.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That's not going backward. That's going forw=
ard to something we haven't built yet. That's the real opportunity hiding i=
n this crisis.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The question isn't whether this transformati=
