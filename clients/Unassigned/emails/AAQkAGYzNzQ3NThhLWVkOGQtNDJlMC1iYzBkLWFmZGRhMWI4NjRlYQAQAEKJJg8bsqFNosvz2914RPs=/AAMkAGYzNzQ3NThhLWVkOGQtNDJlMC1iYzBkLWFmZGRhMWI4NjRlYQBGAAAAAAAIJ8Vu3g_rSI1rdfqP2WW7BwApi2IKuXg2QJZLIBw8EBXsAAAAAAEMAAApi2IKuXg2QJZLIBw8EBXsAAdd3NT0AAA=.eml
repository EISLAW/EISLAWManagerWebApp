1. A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models: From Prompts =
to Production Systems
Watching: Context Engineering (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/dfed3f=
43-9208-4175-b458-5785b1e8696e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshg=
UC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? The term "prompt engineering" has become so dil=
uted it now means little more than "typing things into a chatbot." As LLMs =
evolve into complex multi-agent systems integrated with tools, databases, a=
nd real-time data streams, we need a new framework to understand how to des=
ign, manage, and optimize the complete information payload that drives AI s=
ystems. Simple prompts are no longer sufficient when your AI needs to coord=
inate across multiple data sources, maintain conversation history, and adap=
t to dynamic contexts.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers adapt the term =E2=80=9CCont=
ext Engineering=E2=80=9D and define it as a formal discipline that encompas=
ses the systematic optimization of all information provided to LLMs at infe=
rence time. They analyzed over 1,400 research papers to create a comprehens=
ive taxonomy that decomposes Context Engineering into foundational componen=
ts (retrieval, generation, processing, management) and sophisticated implem=
entations (RAG systems, memory architectures, tool integration, multi-agent=
 coordination). This framework moves beyond ad-hoc prompt design to establi=
sh engineering principles for building production-grade AI systems.
What are the key findings? The survey reveals that successful AI applicatio=
ns require sophisticated orchestration of multiple context streams - from r=
eal-time data feeds to persistent memory systems. The researchers identify =
critical patterns: context retrieval systems that dynamically fetch relevan=
t information, context processing pipelines that filter and prioritize data=
, and context management frameworks that maintain coherence across extended=
 interactions. Most importantly, they show that the evolution from prompts =
to context engineering mirrors the maturation of software engineering itsel=
f.
Why does it matter? This establishes Context Engineering as one of the core=
 disciplines for enterprise AI deployment. As organizations move from AI de=
mos to production systems, they need principled approaches to manage the co=
mplexity of multi-modal, multi-source contexts. The framework provides a ro=
admap for building AI systems that can handle real-world complexity - from =
financial analysis requiring multiple data streams to healthcare applicatio=
ns needing patient history and real-time monitoring. For practitioners, thi=
s means moving beyond prompt libraries to architecting comprehensive contex=
t management systems.

2. QuestA: Expanding Reasoning Capacity in LLMs via Question Augmentation
Watching: QuestA (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/02af41dd-e6ae-41bb-=
bf39-ed65bbeefd6d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Reinforcement learning has become essential for=
 training reasoning models, but it faces a fundamental limitation: on hard =
problems where models rarely generate correct solutions, standard RL provid=
es weak learning signals. When a model consistently fails at complex mathem=
atical problems, it receives mostly zero rewards, leading to poor gradient =
updates and minimal improvement. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem - m=
odels need to solve problems to learn, but they can't solve problems withou=
t learning.
How does it solve the problem? QuestA introduces partial solutions during t=
raining to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning =
signals. Instead of expecting models to solve "prove that for all prime p >=
 3, p=C2=B2 =E2=89=A1 1 (mod 24)" from scratch, QuestA might provide the hi=
nt "first show p =E2=89=A1 =C2=B11 (mod 24)." This transforms an all-or-not=
hing reward landscape into a graduated learning environment where models ca=
n make incremental progress. The approach dynamically adjusts question diff=
iculty based on model capability, creating a curriculum that maintains opti=
mal challenge levels.
What are the key findings? QuestA achieves new state-of-the-art performance=
 on mathematical benchmarks using only 1.5B parameter models: 67.1% on AIME=
24 (+5.3%), 59.5% on AIME25 (+10.0%), and 35.5% on HMMT25 (+4.0%). More imp=
ortantly, QuestA improves both pass@1 (best single attempt) and pass@k (bes=
t of k attempts), particularly on problems where standard RL makes no progr=
ess. The method enables continual improvement over strong baselines like De=
epSeek-R1 and OpenMath Nemotron by ensuring models always have learnable tr=
ajectories.
Why does it matter? QuestA demonstrates that the path to stronger reasoning=
 models isn't just larger scale or more compute, but smarter training strat=
egies. By solving the sparse reward problem that has plagued RL for reasoni=
ng, it opens the door to training models on progressively harder problems w=
ithout hitting learning plateaus. For the broader AI community, this sugges=
ts that curriculum design and adaptive difficulty adjustment may be as impo=
rtant as architectural innovations for achieving human-level reasoning.
3. Your LLM Knows the Future: Uncovering Its Multi-Token Prediction Potenti=
al
Watching: Multi-Token Prediction (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/ef7=
2a193-28b2-47e2-a12a-31d09fc17824?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9h=
shgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Autoregressive language models are fundamentall=
y constrained by their token-by-token generation process. This sequential b=
ottleneck limits inference speed and prevents parallelism, especially frust=
rating when the model has high confidence about upcoming tokens. Consider g=
enerating "The capital of France is Paris" - the model must laboriously pro=
duce each token despite knowing with near-certainty what comes next. This i=
nefficiency becomes critical as models scale and deployment costs mount.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers discovered that standard aut=
oregressive models already encode information about future tokens in their =
hidden states - they just can't express it. Their framework appends special=
 mask tokens to prompts (like "what is two plus two? [MASK] [MASK] [MASK]")=
 and trains the model to fill multiple positions simultaneously. They use g=
ated LoRA adaptation to preserve the original model's capabilities while ad=
ding multi-token prediction, plus a learnable sampler module that ensures c=
oherent sequences. The system includes consistency losses to align multi-to=
ken and single-token predictions.
What are the key findings? When prompted with "what is two plus two?" follo=
wed by placeholder tokens, the correct sequence "equals four" appears in th=
e top 200 logits of a standard pretrained model - revealing latent knowledg=
e of future tokens. After training, the system achieves 1.5-5.2x speedup ac=
ross different domains, with coding and math showing the highest accelerati=
on due to their predictable structure. The method generates up to 9 tokens =
per inference step while maintaining quality. Remarkably, this is achieved =
through lightweight fine-tuning that adds minimal parameters to existing mo=
dels.
Why does it matter? This reveals that the inefficiency of autoregressive ge=
neration isn't fundamental but rather a limitation of how we've trained mod=
els to express their knowledge. For deployment at scale, multi-token predic=
tion could dramatically reduce serving costs and latency. The discovery tha=
t models already "know" future tokens also has theoretical implications - i=
t suggests that autoregressive pretraining creates richer internal represen=
tations than previously understood. As inference costs increasingly dominat=
e AI deployment, such efficiency improvements become economically crucial.
4. MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning
Watching: MindJourney (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/3dff0452-edde-=
4e19-b412-291f34b62641?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Vision-language models excel at describing what=
 they see but fail catastrophically at spatial reasoning. Ask a VLM to pred=
ict how a scene will look after moving forward or turning left, and it stru=
ggles - these models perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dy=
namics. This limitation is critical for embodied AI applications like robot=
ics and navigation, where understanding spatial relationships and predictin=
g visual changes from movement is essential. Current VLMs are like having p=
erfect vision but no spatial memory or imagination.
How does it solve the problem? MindJourney couples VLMs with controllable w=
orld models based on video diffusion to grant them 3D reasoning capabilitie=
s. The framework works through iterative exploration: the VLM sketches a ca=
mera trajectory (e.g., "move forward 2 meters, turn left 30 degrees"), the =
world model synthesizes the corresponding views, and the VLM reasons over t=
his multi-view evidence. This creates a feedback loop where the VLM can tes=
t spatial hypotheses by "imagining" different viewpoints, similar to how hu=
mans mentally rotate objects or navigate spaces.
What are the key findings? Without any fine-tuning, MindJourney achieves ov=
er 8% performance boost on the spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, with peak i=
mprovements reaching 15% on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. The approac=
h works across different VLM architectures and even enhances models already=
 trained with reinforcement learning. Analysis reveals that the world model=
 doesn't just provide additional views - it helps VLMs build coherent 3D re=
presentations by enforcing physical consistency across generated perspectiv=
es. The iterative exploration process converges to better solutions than si=
ngle-shot reasoning.
Why does it matter? This demonstrates that complex capabilities like spatia=
l reasoning don't require retraining foundation models - they can emerge fr=
om clever orchestration of specialized components. For robotics and embodie=
d AI, MindJourney offers a practical path to spatial intelligence without t=
he massive data requirements of end-to-end training. More broadly, it exemp=
lifies test-time scaling: improving model performance not through larger tr=
aining runs but through increased computation during inference, guided by w=
orld models that encode physical priors.
5. Scaling Up RL: Unlocking Diverse Reasoning in LLMs via Prolonged Trainin=
g
Watching: Prolonged Training (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e1059c7=
4-fb24-4fd6-a149-a0d61aff1faa?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgU=
C7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Recent reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and De=
epSeek-R1 have shown impressive gains through reinforcement learning, but a=
 critical question remains: Does RL truly expand reasoning capabilities, or=
 does it merely amplify patterns already present in base models? Most RL tr=
aining runs are relatively short, potentially leaving significant untapped =
potential. If RL only redistributes probability mass rather than discoverin=
g new reasoning strategies, then we're fundamentally limited by pretraining=
 data rather than training methodology.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers conducted extensive experime=
nts with prolonged RL training - running for significantly more steps than =
typical approaches. They introduced ProRL (Prolonged Reinforcement Learning=
), which includes KL divergence control to prevent mode collapse, reference=
 policy resetting to maintain exploration, and training across diverse task=
 suites to encourage generalization. By training small models (1-3B paramet=
ers) for extended periods with careful hyperparameter tuning, they could is=
olate the effects of RL duration from model scale.
What are the key findings? The results fundamentally challenge the "RL as r=
edistribution" hypothesis. With prolonged training, RL models discover reas=
oning strategies completely absent from base models, even under extensive s=
ampling (k=3D1000+). Performance improvements strongly correlate with both =
task competence and training duration, suggesting RL genuinely explores new=
 solution spaces over time. On problems where base models achieve 0% succes=
s regardless of sampling budget, ProRL models reach 40-60% accuracy. The di=
versity of reasoning approaches actually increases with longer training, co=
ntradicting the narrow exploitation hypothesis.
Why does it matter? This suggests we've been dramatically underestimating R=
L's potential for improving reasoning. While the race for larger models con=
tinues, these findings indicate that patient, prolonged training might unlo=
ck capabilities we assumed required scale. For practitioners, it means that=
 investing in longer RL runs could yield better returns than simply scaling=
 model size. The discovery that RL can find genuinely novel reasoning strat=
egies also has implications for AI safety - these models might develop unex=
pected problem-solving approaches not present in their training data.
6. MCPEval: Automatic MCP-based Deep Evaluation for AI Agent Models
Watching: MCPEval (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/0a56cf66-500a-4a95=
-9585-ea8a708b5be7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Evaluating AI agents is fundamentally broken. C=
urrent methods rely on static benchmarks that don't reflect real-world tool=
 use, or labor-intensive manual evaluation that doesn't scale. As agents in=
creasingly interact with external tools and APIs through protocols like Mod=
el Context Protocol (MCP), we need evaluation frameworks that can automatic=
ally assess end-to-end performance in realistic environments. How do you me=
asure if an agent can successfully book a flight, analyze a spreadsheet, or=
 coordinate across multiple tools?
How does it solve the problem? MCPEval leverages the MCP standard itself as=
 an evaluation framework. It automatically generates task scenarios by intr=
ospecting available tools in MCP servers, creates ground-truth tool call se=
quences, and evaluates agents on both execution accuracy and trajectory qua=
lity. The framework operates in three stages: task generation (creating rea=
listic scenarios based on available tools), verification (validating tasks =
are solvable), and evaluation (testing models on tool selection, parameter =
accuracy, and task completion). Because it's built on MCP, it seamlessly in=
tegrates with any MCP-compatible tools without manual configuration.
What are the key findings? Across five real-world domains (Finance, Airbnb,=
 Healthcare, Sports, National Parks), MCPEval reveals striking performance =
variations between models. GPT-4 achieves 73% strict tool-matching accuracy=
, while other models range from 45-68%. More importantly, the framework unc=
overs nuanced failure modes: models often select correct tools but fail on =
parameter formatting, or generate plausible but incorrect tool sequences. T=
he trajectory evaluation shows that even when final outputs are correct, in=
termediate steps often contain errors that could compound in longer interac=
tions.
Why does it matter? MCPEval transforms agent evaluation from a manual, ad-h=
oc process to an automated, standardized protocol. For organizations deploy=
ing agents, it provides continuous integration-style testing for AI systems=
 - automatically detecting regressions as tools or models change. The frame=
work's ability to generate synthetic evaluation data also addresses the sca=
rcity of real-world agent trajectories for training. As MCP adoption grows,=
 MCPEval could become the standard for certifying agent capabilities, simil=
ar to how security frameworks certify system compliance.

4-9d20-42ec-83f7-161aa5c4672d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgU=
C7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Building AI that runs efficiently on consumer d=
evices while maintaining quality comparable to cloud models presents enormo=
us technical challenges. Privacy concerns and latency requirements make clo=
ud-only solutions insufficient for personal AI assistants. Yet cramming bil=
lion-parameter models onto phones and laptops requires extreme optimization=
 without sacrificing capabilities. Apple needed models that could run on-de=
vice for privacy-critical tasks while seamlessly coordinating with server m=
odels for complex reasoning.
How does it solve the problem? Apple developed two complementary models: a =
~3B parameter on-device model optimized through architectural innovations l=
ike KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training, and a server mo=
del using novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts (PT-MoE) that combines tr=
ack parallelism with sparse computation. The on-device model underwent aggr=
essive compression with minimal quality loss (4.6% regression on MGSM). Bot=
h models were trained on multilingual datasets with 30% non-English content=
, using synthetic data for math, code, and instruction following, while imp=
lementing careful filtering to exclude personal information.
What are the key findings? The technical innovations enable remarkable effi=
ciency: 2-bit quantization reduces the on-device model size by 75% while ma=
intaining performance, KV-cache sharing cuts memory requirements during inf=
erence, and the PT-MoE architecture achieves server-model quality at fracti=
on of typical computational cost. Benchmark results show the 3B on-device m=
odel matching or exceeding larger models on many tasks. The expanded 150K t=
oken vocabulary (50% increase) dramatically improves multilingual performan=
ce. Notably, Apple's training explicitly excluded user data, relying instea=
d on web crawling with opt-out mechanisms and synthetic data generation.
Why does it matter? It demonstrates that privacy-preserving, efficient AI i=
s achievable without compromising quality. The architectural innovations - =
particularly 2-bit quantization with maintained accuracy - could enable a n=
ew generation of on-device AI applications. For developers, the Foundation =
Models framework provides direct access to these capabilities with just a f=
ew lines of code. As privacy regulations tighten globally, Apple's approach=
 of strong on-device models coordinated with private cloud compute could be=
come the standard architecture for consumer AI.
8. CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement Learn=
ing
Watching: CUDA-L1 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/28aebc7b-7177-4610=
-bb6a-a875256d980b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? The explosive demand for GPU compute, driven by=
 LLMs, makes CUDA optimization more critical than ever. Yet even expert eng=
ineers struggle with manual optimization, relying on trial-and-error to fin=
d optimal configurations. Current automated approaches, including advanced =
models like o1 and DeepSeek-R1, achieve less than 10% improvement on CUDA c=
ode. With GPU resources increasingly scarce and expensive, suboptimal CUDA =
kernels waste millions in compute costs. We need automated systems that can=
 match or exceed human experts at GPU optimization.
How does it solve the problem? CUDA-L1 introduces contrastive reinforcement=
 learning for CUDA optimization. Unlike traditional RL that evaluates code =
in isolation, contrastive RL learns by comparing pairs of implementations, =
effectively learning "this version is faster than that one." The system pro=
gresses through three stages: understanding CUDA patterns, self-supervised =
learning on correctness, and contrastive RL for speed optimization. The key=
 innovation is using execution time differentials as rewards, enabling the =
model to learn optimization principles rather than memorizing specific patt=
erns.
What are the key findings? CUDA-L1 achieves average speedups of 17.7x on Ke=
rnelBench, with peak improvements reaching 449x. The model shows remarkable=
 portability - trained on A100, it achieves 17.8x on H100, 19.0x on RTX 309=
0, without architecture-specific training. Analysis reveals CUDA-L1 discove=
rs sophisticated optimization techniques: combining shared memory with vect=
orized loads, identifying non-obvious bottlenecks like CPU-GPU synchronizat=
ion, and rejecting seemingly beneficial optimizations that actually harm pe=
rformance. The model learns to balance multiple optimization strategies rat=
her than applying them blindly.
Why does it matter? CUDA-L1 demonstrates that RL can transform domain-speci=
fic optimization from an expert skill to an automated process. For the AI i=
ndustry facing GPU scarcity, automated CUDA optimization could effectively =
increase available compute by making existing resources drastically more ef=
ficient. The contrastive learning approach also has broader implications - =
it could be applied to database query optimization, compiler design, or any=
 domain where performance comparison is easier than absolute measurement. A=
s one implementation detail: training required only 50K iterations, suggest=
ing this approach is practically deployable today.
9. Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty
Watching: (Non-)Binary Rewards (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/fd146=
5b1-bfe1-4fca-b3fc-66d41e4ebb5e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Current RL training for reasoning uses binary r=
ewards - answers are either right (reward=3D1) or wrong (reward=3D0). This =
creates two problems: models become overconfident even when guessing, and t=
hey lose calibration on other tasks because the training signal encourages =
maximum certainty. In the real world, we need AI systems that can express u=
ncertainty, say "I don't know," and provide confidence estimates. Binary re=
wards actively train models to hide their uncertainty, creating systems tha=
t confidently hallucinate rather than admitting limitations.
How does it solve the problem? RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibratio=
n Rewards) replaces binary evaluation with multi-level feedback that encour=
ages models to reason about uncertainty. During training, models can expres=
s confidence levels or explicitly state uncertainty. The reward function co=
nsiders both correctness and calibration - a confident correct answer recei=
ves full reward, an uncertain correct answer receives partial reward, and a=
ppropriate expressions of uncertainty on impossible problems receive positi=
ve reward. The framework includes mechanisms for models to explain their re=
asoning process, identify missing information, and declare when problems ar=
e underspecified.
What are the key findings? RLCR dramatically improves both accuracy and cal=
ibration without sacrificing performance. On question-answering benchmarks,=
 RLCR models achieve comparable accuracy to binary-reward training while im=
proving calibration by 15-20%. More impressively, this calibration transfer=
s to other domains - models trained with RLCR show better uncertainty estim=
ates on completely different tasks. The models learn nuanced uncertainty ex=
pression: distinguishing between computational uncertainty ("this calculati=
on is complex") versus epistemological uncertainty ("this requires informat=
ion I don't have"). False positive rates on trick questions drop by 40%.
Why does it matter? As AI systems are deployed in high-stakes domains, thei=
r ability to express uncertainty becomes crucial. A medical AI that confide=
ntly gives wrong diagnoses is far more dangerous than one that appropriatel=
y expresses uncertainty. RLCR shows that we can train models to be both cap=
able and calibrated without choosing between them. For developers, this mea=
ns building AI systems that users can trust - not because they're always ri=
ght, but because they accurately communicate their confidence levels.=20
Putting It All Together: The Maturation of AI Engineering
More and more AI systems are maturing from impressive demos to engineered p=
roducts. We see multiple convergent themes:
From prompts to context orchestration - Context Engineering supersedes prom=
pt engineering as systems grow more complex, requiring systematic managemen=
t of multi-modal, multi-source information streams.
Test-time intelligence emergence - Rather than solving everything through l=
arger pretraining, we see intelligence emerging from clever inference-time =
computation (MindJourney), multi-token prediction, and test-time scaling.
RL's untapped potential - Prolonged training reveals RL can discover genuin=
ely novel strategies, while innovations like contrastive learning (CUDA-L1)=
 and calibration rewards (RLCR) show domain-specific applications.
Engineering over scale - From Apple's efficient on-device models to QuestA'=
s curriculum learning, the focus shifts from raw parameter count to archite=
ctural efficiency and training innovation.
The future of AI might not lie in monolithic models but in orchestrated sys=
tems that combine specialized components, adapt computation to task demands=
, and honestly communicate their uncertainties. As industry demand and adop=
tion are growing rapidly, these systems need to mature from a research curi=
osity to an engineering discipline with principles, patterns, and practices=
 that will define the next generation of intelligent systems.

ot;prompt engineering&quot; has become so diluted it now means little more =
than &quot;typing things into a chatbot.&quot; As LLMs evolve into complex =
multi-agent systems integrated with tools, databases, and real-time data st=
reams, we need a new framework to understand how to design, manage, and opt=
imize the complete information payload that drives AI systems. Simple promp=
ts are no longer sufficient when your AI needs to coordinate across multipl=
e data sources, maintain conversation history, and adapt to dynamic context=
s.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><s=
pan> The researchers adapt the term =E2=80=9CContext Engineering=E2=80=9D a=
nd define it as a formal discipline that encompasses the systematic optimiz=
ation of all information provided to LLMs at inference time. They analyzed =
over 1,400 research papers to create a comprehensive taxonomy that decompos=
es Context Engineering into foundational components (retrieval, generation,=
 processing, management) and sophisticated implementations (RAG systems, me=
mory architectures, tool integration, multi-agent coordination). This frame=
work moves beyond ad-hoc prompt design to establish engineering principles =
for building production-grade AI systems.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Wh=
at are the key findings?</strong><span> The survey reveals that successful =
AI applications require sophisticated orchestration of multiple context str=
eams - from real-time data feeds to persistent memory systems. The research=
ers identify critical patterns: context retrieval systems that dynamically =
fetch relevant information, context processing pipelines that filter and pr=
ioritize data, and context management frameworks that maintain coherence ac=
ross extended interactions. Most importantly, they show that the evolution =
from prompts to context engineering mirrors the maturation of software engi=

ment learning has become essential for training reasoning models, but it fa=
ces a fundamental limitation: on hard problems where models rarely generate=
 correct solutions, standard RL provides weak learning signals. When a mode=
l consistently fails at complex mathematical problems, it receives mostly z=
ero rewards, leading to poor gradient updates and minimal improvement. This=
 creates a chicken-and-egg problem - models need to solve problems to learn=
, but they can't solve problems without learning.</span></p><p style=3D"mar=

trong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> QuestA introduces parti=
al solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more =
informative learning signals. Instead of expecting models to solve &quot;pr=
ove that for all prime p &gt; 3, p=C2=B2 =E2=89=A1 1 (mod 24)&quot; from sc=
ratch, QuestA might provide the hint &quot;first show p =E2=89=A1 =C2=B11 (=
mod 24).&quot; This transforms an all-or-nothing reward landscape into a gr=
aduated learning environment where models can make incremental progress. Th=
e approach dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on model capabilit=
y, creating a curriculum that maintains optimal challenge levels.</span></p=

eves new state-of-the-art performance on mathematical benchmarks using only=
 1.5B parameter models: 67.1% on AIME24 (+5.3%), 59.5% on AIME25 (+10.0%), =
and 35.5% on HMMT25 (+4.0%). More importantly, QuestA improves both pass@1 =
(best single attempt) and pass@k (best of k attempts), particularly on prob=

ovement over strong baselines like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenMath Nemotron by ens=

o stronger reasoning models isn't just larger scale or more compute, but sm=
arter training strategies. By solving the sparse reward problem that has pl=
agued RL for reasoning, it opens the door to training models on progressive=
ly harder problems without hitting learning plateaus. For the broader AI co=
mmunity, this suggests that curriculum design and adaptive difficulty adjus=
tment may be as important as architectural innovations for achieving human-=

This reveals that the inefficiency of autoregressive generation isn't funda=
mental but rather a limitation of how we've trained models to express their=
 knowledge. For deployment at scale, multi-token prediction could dramatica=
lly reduce serving costs and latency. The discovery that models already &qu=

 that autoregressive pretraining creates richer internal representations th=
an previously understood. As inference costs increasingly dominate AI deplo=
yment, such efficiency improvements become economically crucial.</span></p>=

 VLM to predict how a scene will look after moving forward or turning left,=
 and it struggles - these models perceive 2D images but lack an internal mo=
del of 3D dynamics. This limitation is critical for embodied AI application=

ey couples VLMs with controllable world models based on video diffusion to =

 exploration: the VLM sketches a camera trajectory (e.g., &quot;move forwar=
d 2 meters, turn left 30 degrees&quot;), the world model synthesizes the co=
rresponding views, and the VLM reasons over this multi-view evidence. This =
creates a feedback loop where the VLM can test spatial hypotheses by &quot;=
imagining&quot; different viewpoints, similar to how humans mentally rotate=
 objects or navigate spaces.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

 trained with reinforcement learning. Analysis reveals that the world model=
 doesn't just provide additional views - it helps VLMs build coherent 3D re=

es it solve?</strong><span> Recent reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and De=
epSeek-R1 have shown impressive gains through reinforcement learning, but a=
 critical question remains: Does RL truly expand reasoning capabilities, or=
 does it merely amplify patterns already present in base models? Most RL tr=
aining runs are relatively short, potentially leaving significant untapped =
potential. If RL only redistributes probability mass rather than discoverin=
g new reasoning strategies, then we're fundamentally limited by pretraining=
 data rather than training methodology.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How =
does it solve the problem?</strong><span> The researchers conducted extensi=
ve experiments with prolonged RL training - running for significantly more =
steps than typical approaches. They introduced ProRL (Prolonged Reinforceme=
nt Learning), which includes KL divergence control to prevent mode collapse=
, reference policy resetting to maintain exploration, and training across d=
iverse task suites to encourage generalization. By training small models (1=
-3B parameters) for extended periods with careful hyperparameter tuning, th=
ey could isolate the effects of RL duration from model scale.</span></p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings?</strong><span> The results fun=
damentally challenge the &quot;RL as redistribution&quot; hypothesis. With =
prolonged training, RL models discover reasoning strategies completely abse=
nt from base models, even under extensive sampling (k=3D1000+). Performance=
 improvements strongly correlate with both task competence and training dur=
ation, suggesting RL genuinely explores new solution spaces over time. On p=
roblems where base models achieve 0% success regardless of sampling budget,=
 ProRL models reach 40-60% accuracy. The diversity of reasoning approaches =
actually increases with longer training, contradicting the narrow exploitat=
ion hypothesis.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong>=
<span> This suggests we've been dramatically underestimating RL's potential=
 for improving reasoning. While the race for larger models continues, these=
 findings indicate that patient, prolonged training might unlock capabiliti=
es we assumed required scale. For practitioners, it means that investing in=
 longer RL runs could yield better returns than simply scaling model size. =
The discovery that RL can find genuinely novel reasoning strategies also ha=
s implications for AI safety - these models might develop unexpected proble=
m-solving approaches not present in their training data.</span></p><h2 clas=

ken. Current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't reflect real-worl=

nts increasingly interact with external tools and APIs through protocols li=
ke Model Context Protocol (MCP), we need evaluation frameworks that can aut=

rd itself as an evaluation framework. It automatically generates task scena=
rios by introspecting available tools in MCP servers, creates ground-truth =
tool call sequences, and evaluates agents on both execution accuracy and tr=
ajectory quality. The framework operates in three stages: task generation (=
creating realistic scenarios based on available tools), verification (valid=
ating tasks are solvable), and evaluation (testing models on tool selection=
, parameter accuracy, and task completion). Because it's built on MCP, it s=
eamlessly integrates with any MCP-compatible tools without manual configura=

ls. GPT-4 achieves 73% strict tool-matching accuracy, while other models ra=
nge from 45-68%. More importantly, the framework uncovers nuanced failure m=
odes: models often select correct tools but fail on parameter formatting, o=

evaluation from a manual, ad-hoc process to an automated, standardized prot=

ls or models change. The framework's ability to generate synthetic evaluati=
on data also addresses the scarcity of real-world agent trajectories for tr=

ding AI that runs efficiently on consumer devices while maintaining quality=
 comparable to cloud models presents enormous technical challenges. Privacy=
 concerns and latency requirements make cloud-only solutions insufficient f=
or personal AI assistants. Yet cramming billion-parameter models onto phone=
s and laptops requires extreme optimization without sacrificing capabilitie=
s. Apple needed models that could run on-device for privacy-critical tasks =
while seamlessly coordinating with server models for complex reasoning.</sp=

pple developed two complementary models: a ~3B parameter on-device model op=
timized through architectural innovations like KV-cache sharing and 2-bit q=
uantization-aware training, and a server model using novel Parallel-Track M=
ixture-of-Experts (PT-MoE) that combines track parallelism with sparse comp=
utation. The on-device model underwent aggressive compression with minimal =
quality loss (4.6% regression on MGSM). Both models were trained on multili=
ngual datasets with 30% non-English content, using synthetic data for math,=
 code, and instruction following, while implementing careful filtering to e=
xclude personal information.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

y findings?</strong><span> The technical innovations enable remarkable effi=
ciency: 2-bit quantization reduces the on-device model size by 75% while ma=
intaining performance, KV-cache sharing cuts memory requirements during inf=
erence, and the PT-MoE architecture achieves server-model quality at fracti=
on of typical computational cost. Benchmark results show the 3B on-device m=
odel matching or exceeding larger models on many tasks. The expanded 150K t=
oken vocabulary (50% increase) dramatically improves multilingual performan=
ce. Notably, Apple's training explicitly excluded user data, relying instea=

ates that privacy-preserving, efficient AI is achievable without compromisi=
ng quality. The architectural innovations - particularly 2-bit quantization=
 with maintained accuracy - could enable a new generation of on-device AI a=
pplications. For developers, the Foundation Models framework provides direc=

. Current automated approaches, including advanced models like o1 and DeepS=
eek-R1, achieve less than 10% improvement on CUDA code. With GPU resources =
increasingly scarce and expensive, suboptimal CUDA kernels waste millions i=

lem does it solve?</strong><span> Current RL training for reasoning uses bi=
nary rewards - answers are either right (reward=3D1) or wrong (reward=3D0).=
 This creates two problems: models become overconfident even when guessing,=
 and they lose calibration on other tasks because the training signal encou=
rages maximum certainty. In the real world, we need AI systems that can exp=
ress uncertainty, say &quot;I don't know,&quot; and provide confidence esti=
mates. Binary rewards actively train models to hide their uncertainty, crea=
ting systems that confidently hallucinate rather than admitting limitations=
.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><sp=
an> RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards) replaces binary =
evaluation with multi-level feedback that encourages models to reason about=
 uncertainty. During training, models can express confidence levels or expl=
icitly state uncertainty. The reward function considers both correctness an=
d calibration - a confident correct answer receives full reward, an uncerta=
in correct answer receives partial reward, and appropriate expressions of u=
ncertainty on impossible problems receive positive reward. The framework in=
cludes mechanisms for models to explain their reasoning process, identify m=
issing information, and declare when problems are underspecified.</span></p=

-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings?</strong><span> RLCR dramat=
ically improves both accuracy and calibration without sacrificing performan=
ce. On question-answering benchmarks, RLCR models achieve comparable accura=
cy to binary-reward training while improving calibration by 15-20%. More im=
pressively, this calibration transfers to other domains - models trained wi=
th RLCR show better uncertainty estimates on completely different tasks. Th=
e models learn nuanced uncertainty expression: distinguishing between compu=
tational uncertainty (&quot;this calculation is complex&quot;) versus epist=
emological uncertainty (&quot;this requires information I don't have&quot;)=
. False positive rates on trick questions drop by 40%.</span></p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span> As AI systems are deployed =
in high-stakes domains, their ability to express uncertainty becomes crucia=
l. A medical AI that confidently gives wrong diagnoses is far more dangerou=
s than one that appropriately expresses uncertainty. RLCR shows that we can=
 train models to be both capable and calibrated without choosing between th=
em. For developers, this means building AI systems that users can trust - n=
ot because they're always right, but because they accurately communicate th=
eir confidence levels. </span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D=
