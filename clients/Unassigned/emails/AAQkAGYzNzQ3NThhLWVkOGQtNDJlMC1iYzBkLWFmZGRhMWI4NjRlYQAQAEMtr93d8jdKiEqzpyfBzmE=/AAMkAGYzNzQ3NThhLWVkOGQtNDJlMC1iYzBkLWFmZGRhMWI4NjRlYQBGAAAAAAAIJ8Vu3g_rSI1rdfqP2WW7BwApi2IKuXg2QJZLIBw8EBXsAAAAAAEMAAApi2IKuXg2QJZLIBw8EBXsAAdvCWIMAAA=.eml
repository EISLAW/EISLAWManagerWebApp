Dear Trader,

Last week, a big-name research company you may recognize dropped a
"groundbreaking analysis" telling subscribers to buy USA Rare Earth
(NASDAQ: USAR) for potential 18,000% gains.=C2=A0

Complete with fancy charts, bold predictions, and that classic guru
confidence.

So far this promotion has made millions of dollars.

Here's what they won't tell you:=C2=A0

The guys who helped take USAR public? Friends of Option Pit.

Two of the first bankers to work with USAR back in 2019? Frank Gregory
=E2=80=A6 and his business partner.

Both of whom have worked (and still work) with Option Pit.

While this company was crafting a marketing campaign about "emerging
opportunities," Option Pit=E2=80=99s staff was literally structuring the
deals that brought this company to public markets - going all the way
back to 2018.=C2=A0

In fact, their involvement goes all the way back to 2019.=C2=A0

They had front-row seats to the initial three rounds of USAR=E2=80=99s
financing in 2019 and 2020 - which 2 staff members at Option Pit
invested in.

This is what you get here at Option Pit.=C2=A0

The real, inside story.

And many of you know it, too:

[FREP]

[FREP]

This is the Option Pit difference in one story.

WE'VE BEEN TRADING USAR SINCE MARCH - WITH REAL MONEY

When USAR went public March 14th, we weren't scrambling to understand
rare earth minerals.=C2=A0

Frank published a detailed analysis on April 29th while most companies
were still figuring out what rare earth independence actually means
for America.

Frank knew about this opportunity SINCE DECEMBER 2018, when he sat
down with one of USAR's founders at the Trump Hotel in Washington,
D.C.=C2=A0

Frank dropped over $1200 on bourbon that night.=C2=A0

Not generosity - strategy.=C2=A0

Frank became one of the first bankers to sign with USAR. IN 2019.
Before they had a ticker symbol. Six years before this "research"
company discovered this "groundbreaking opportunity."

Since then, we've recommended USAR in our Capitol Gains long-term
portfolio and traded it multiple times across our products with
documented real money results.

[FREP]

=C2=A0

WHAT USAR ACTUALLY REPRESENTS (BEYOND THE HYPE)

USA Rare Earth isn't some speculative mining play these newsletter
gurus found in a stock screener. This is strategic national security.

Right now, America imports 85% of its rare earth needs. Three-quarters
of the materials essential for defense systems, aviation technology,
and every piece of consumer electronics you own comes from foreign
sources. Primarily China, which controls global rare earth production
like OPEC controls oil.

When China restricts rare earth exports - and they have before -
American manufacturers scramble. When geopolitical tensions rise,
these supply chains become weapons.

USAR's Round Top project in West Texas represents a legitimate shot at
reducing that dangerous dependence. That's fundamental analysis that
matters when you're risking real capital. Not promotional hype about
"the next big thing."

THE CRT FRAMEWORK: WHY WE TRADE WHAT WE RECOMMEND

Here's what separates us from every newsletter operation: Before we
tell you to buy anything, it must pass our CRT process.

C =3D CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE
R =3D REPEATABLE
T =3D TEACHABLE

We prove it works with our own money, demonstrate we can repeat the
success, and verify we can teach you to execute it yourself.=C2=A0

Real trades. Real money. Real results you can independently verify.

These other companies? They parade backtested gains around like actual
performance. They craft compelling stories about stocks they've never
traded with theoretical positions they'd never risk their own capital
on.

They're selling newsletters. We're running a trading operation.

THE RELATIONSHIP ADVANTAGE THEY CAN'T FAKE

Frank=E2=80=99s contacts who helped take USAR public didn=E2=80=99t do so o=
nly to
disappear. One worked with us. We know his track record, his
analytical approach, his understanding of rare earth market dynamics.
While he was structuring USAR's path to public markets, we were
watching the process unfold.

That's not insider trading - that's insider understanding.=C2=A0

There's a massive difference between having material non-public
information and having relationships that help you understand what
public information actually means.

When USAR filed their S-1, we could read between the lines because we
understood the context. When they announced partnerships, we could
evaluate significance because we knew the players involved.

This is real market intelligence. Not promotional research crafted to
justify predetermined conclusions, but analytical advantages built
through years of legitimate industry participation.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO

Every time you choose Option Pit over these promotional operations,
you're choosing substance over marketing and actual trading expertise
over backtested fantasies.

You're getting recommendations from people who risk their own capital
on every call.=C2=A0

You're getting analysis from traders who understand companies and
management teams because we've built those relationships through years
of actual market participation.

Most importantly, you're getting information advantages these
operations literally cannot replicate. They can hire copywriters and
craft compelling campaigns. What they cannot do is build
relationships, develop industry understanding, and demonstrate track
records that come from years of actually trading these markets with
real money.

THE PROOF IS IN THE USAR STORY

While other companies craft promotional materials about USAR being the
"next big opportunity," we were already profitable on positions
established when the stock went public.

While they manufacture urgency around Chinese rare earth dominance, we
analyze actual strategic implications through direct relationships
with the people building these companies.

While they sell dreams, we deliver results.

That's exactly why you made the right choice following our analysis
instead of waiting for johnny-come-lately newsletters to "discover"
opportunities we've been trading for months=E2=80=A6

On stocks we=E2=80=99ve been talking about for years.

You deserve better than backtested fantasies and manufactured
urgency.=C2=A0

You deserve real market intelligence from people who actually trade
these markets with their own capital, backed by relationships these
promotional operations will never replicate.

That's what you get with Option Pit. And stories like USAR prove it
every single time.

HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND,
