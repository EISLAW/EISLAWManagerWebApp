We need to talk about Model Context Protocol (MCP), because I see too many =
teams treating it like it=E2=80=99s a silver bullet. It=E2=80=99s not.=20
What=E2=80=99s MCP? MCP is how your AI talks to your tools. All of them. Yo=
ur databases, your documents, your Slack, your code repos=E2=80=94everythin=
g. It's the difference between copy-pasting from five different systems for=
 20 minutes versus asking Claude one question and getting an answer that pu=
lls from all of them automatically. Zapier's using it to hit 89% AI adoptio=
n. Block's using it to save 50-75% on development time. The companies that =
get MCP right are building massive competitive advantages.
The companies that get it wrong are creating disasters.
Back in April, I wrote about MCP as this fundamental shift [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/4ac3b33e-f349-43fc-a859-6638f950bafb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In=
0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94from telling AI exa=
ctly what to do to just describing tools and letting AI figure it out. I co=
vered the operational realities, the latency questions, the security concer=
ns.=20
But here's what I've learned since then: knowing how MCP works isn't enough=
=2E The real problem=E2=80=94the one that'=
s killing 95% of AI implementations=
=E2=80=94isn't understanding MCP's capabilities. It's understanding where M=
CP belongs in your architecture. Since April I=E2=80=99ve seen too many tea=
ms get excited about "orchestration by inference," and then immediately put=
 MCP in their checkout flow or trading system where it destroys everything =
it touches. They understand the what but not the where.
Here's what's actually happening: teams are so excited about connecting AI =
to everything that they're connecting it wrong. They're putting MCP in cust=
omer-facing systems where its 300-800ms latency destroys user experience. T=
hey're granting permissions that expose entire databases (per Docker ~43% o=
f MCP servers have command injection vulnerabilities). Teams are treating M=
CP like a faster API instead of understanding it's an intelligence layer th=
at should never touch your transaction path.
The difference between success and failure isn't the tools=E2=80=94everyone=
's using the same MCP servers. It's architecture. It's knowing that MCP bel=
ongs in background analysis, not checkout flows. In development assistance,=
 not production databases. In decision support, not real-time systems.
This guide gives you a roadmap to implement MCP correctly and avoid those c=
ostly architectural mistakes that can end in broken trust and bad board mee=
tings:
The seven architectural failures that are killing AI implementations=E2=80=
=94from the Universal Router trap that adds latency to everything, to the K=
itchen Sink server pattern that creates security nightmares, to the Real-Ti=
me Context delusion that destroys conversion rates. Each one documented wit=
h real measured latencies and actual company failures.
Where MCP actually works=E2=80=94the Intelligence Layer pattern Block uses =
to analyze millions of transactions without touching production systems. Th=
e Sidecar pattern Zapier uses to enhance workflows without blocking users. =
The Batch pattern that processes overnight intelligence for morning consump=
tion. These aren't theories=E2=80=94they're production patterns from the 5%=
 who succeed.
The security reality nobody discusses=E2=80=94including the Asana breach th=
at exposed 1,000 customers' data across organizations for 34 days, the GitH=
ub MCP vulnerability that's still not fixed, and exactly which of the 5,960=
+ MCP servers you can actually trust (spoiler: about ten).
A practical implementation roadmap=E2=80=94not the vendor fantasy of "deplo=
y in days" but the actual six-month path from prototype to production that =
successful companies follow, complete with go/no-go checkpoints and rollbac=
k procedures.
The actual performance numbers=E2=80=94300-800ms baseline latency that can'=
t be cached away, why JSON-RPC was chosen over faster protocols, and why pu=
tting MCP in your hot path is architectural malpractice.
Because here's the thing nobody's saying clearly: AI lives or dies on workf=
lows. Workflows live or die on integrations. And right now, most teams are =
integrating MCP in ways that make their systems worse, not better. Get this=
 right and you're in the 5% seeing real ROI. Get it wrong and you're joinin=
g the $40 billion waste. The difference isn't better tools=E2=80=94it's kno=
wing where MCP belongs.

7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
This guide addresses the critical gap between Model Context Protocol's prom=
ise and its reality in production. MCP enables AI agents to use your tools =
- connecting Claude or GPT to your databases, documents, and APIs through a=
 standardized protocol. While companies like Zapier and Block achieve trans=
formative results with MCP, 95% of implementations fail catastrophically, c=
ontributing to $40 billion in wasted AI investment.=20
The problem isn't the technology - it's that teams don't understand two cru=
cial things: how to implement MCP without creating security disasters (Part=
 1) and where MCP belongs architecturally (Part 2). Most teams put MCP in c=
ustomer-facing systems where its 300-800ms latency destroys user experience=
, or grant overly broad permissions that lead to data breaches.=20
This guide provides the practical security controls, architectural patterns=
, and decision frameworks that should have shipped with MCP from day one. T=
he difference between joining the 95% failure rate and the 5% success rate =
isn't about having better tools - it's about understanding that MCP is an i=
ntelligence layer for augmentation, not a transactional layer for automatio=
n, and knowing exactly where it belongs in your architecture.
MCP Architecture: The 7 Failure Modes Killing Your AI Implementation
Or: Why 95% of AI projects fail at the integration layer
MCPs are incredibly impactful. We're all using them. When the MIT study rev=
ealed that enterprises fail with AI implementations, much of the time those=
 failures stem from how AI integrates into other workflows and business ope=
rations. The king of integrations right now? MCP.
Getting your MCP architecture correct is a huge predictor of whether you ca=
n implement an AI program successfully. Organizations fall into the same se=
ven failure modes repeatedly. These aren't theoretical problems=E2=80=94the=
se are architectural decisions that doom projects before they even launch.
Model Context Protocol has become industry standard for a reason. It's how =
Claude searches the web when you ask it a question. It's how ChatGPT reads =
documents and calls functions. It was designed to be a tool-calling utility=
 for LLM chat experiences, and at that job, it excels.
Because it's popular, and because people misunderstand how LLMs work, these=
 seven misconceptions crop up constantly. They doom integrations and poison=
 people's thinking about LLMs and MCPs. People conclude AI won't deliver RO=
I, when the real problem is they asked MCP to do what it was never designed=
 to do.
1. The Universal API Router Death Trap
Anyone who's worked in integrations knows the N=C3=97M integration problem.=
 When you integrate tools and endpoints, the number of integrations scales =
combinatorially. Three tools and five endpoints don't mean eight integratio=
ns=E2=80=94you're looking at fifteen. That number explodes as you add more =
systems.
MCP provides what looks like a solution. People think because Model Context=
 Protocol provides a universal API=E2=80=94because it's described as this U=
SB port you plug stuff into=E2=80=94you can use it for everything. It will =
solve your N=C3=97M integration problem space. It will eliminate that combi=
natorial scaling issue where you can never catch up with the endless stream=
 of tools and endpoints.
People are starting to believe MCP solves this magically.
It does not.
MCP adds latency. You cannot route your API calls through MCP as some peopl=
e attempt because it will kill performance. It adds between 300 and 800 mil=
liseconds of latency on each call, plus the cost of inference on top of tha=
t.
Consider what this means for an e-commerce site. You need sub-100ms respons=
e times for product lookups or users abandon their carts=E2=80=94that's doc=
umented user behavior, not opinion. Add MCP's 300-800ms baseline latency an=
d you've turned your snappy product catalog into a patience-testing disaste=
r. Your bounce rates will double. Your conversion rates will crater.
The correct framing for MCP is not as a transaction layer or anything in th=
e real-time operations pathway. It's not a universal fix for the N=C3=97M i=
ntegration problem. There isn't a universal fix.
Think of MCP as an intelligence layer for specific complex workflows. When =
you need to orchestrate insights across multiple systems, understand patter=
ns in data, or generate content or summaries=E2=80=94that's where MCP shine=
s. The moment you put it in your transaction path, you've already failed.
2. The Context Equals Data Confusion
MCP provides data retrieval. People assume they can use it for database que=
ries. That's incorrect.
More accurately, MCP provides contextual orchestration across multiple syst=
ems. That distinction matters because it enables MCP to orchestrate insight=
s about data in background processes. You should not treat it as equivalent=
 to a SQL query for data retrieval.
This has massive cost implications. Studies have shown anywhere between a 3=
=2E25x and 236x increase in input token=
s with MCP integrations. ARC published=
 this data=E2=80=94it's mind-boggling that this is an actual study. Even at=
 the low end, you're tripling your token costs. At the high end, you're inc=
reasing them by two orders of magnitude.
The reason costs explode is that MCPs dramatically increase the context ava=
ilable to inference by a factor of up to 100 or more. It's a massive additi=
onal piece of context. MCP should help you orchestrate which context you're=
 calling for a particular task. It should not serve as your universal data =
retrieval layer. That wastes money and won't get better results than using =
SQL directly.
Think about it this way: if you have a million-SKU catalog, that data belon=
gs in Redis or Elasticsearch where you can retrieve it in milliseconds. MCP=
 should orchestrate insights about patterns in that data, understand relati=
onships between products, and generate recommendations based on complex cri=
teria. One is operational data access. The other is intelligence generation=
=2E Confusing them is like using a F=
errari to deliver pizza=E2=80=94technical=
ly possible, catastrophically wasteful.
3. The Hot Path Placement Disaster
I've seen developers who want MCP on their critical path. When a customer m=
akes a query on a transactional site, they put MCP there to infer and answe=
r the question as intelligently as possible.
That sounds great on a whiteboard. It's an absolute performance disaster in=
 practice.
Consider the numbers. You have 5,000 operations per second and your API han=
dles millions without issue. With MCP in the path, your API would be fine, =
but MCP is throttling and dying. MCP is in trouble because it wasn't design=
ed to handle production traffic.
MCP throughput realistically caps at 5,000 to 50,000 operations per second =
depending on configuration. Meanwhile, modern APIs handle millions. You've =
created a bottleneck that makes no architectural sense.
Another example: you're getting one megabyte of MCP output tokens at a doll=
ar per request. That's charged on every single follow-up message. Suddenly =
you're spending thousands of dollars an hour on MCP. That's if it stands up=
=2E That's if it doesn't fall over. Tha=
t's if the latency doesn't make custom=
ers leave.
I've watched teams learn this lesson expensively. A financial services comp=
any put MCP in their real-time fraud detection path. Every transaction had =
to wait for MCP to "intelligently" assess risk. They lasted exactly three h=
ours in production before queue backups triggered automatic rollback. Three=
 hours of degraded service, thousands of failed transactions, and one very =
uncomfortable engineering retrospective.
You need to separate your fast path=E2=80=94direct APIs=E2=80=94from your s=
mart path=E2=80=94MCP orchestration. Know when to use each. The fast path h=
andles operations where speed matters more than intelligence. The smart pat=
h handles complex decisions where intelligence matters more than speed. Nev=
er confuse the two.
4. Security Theater Instead of Real Security
This applies not just to MCPs but to AI projects in general=E2=80=94securit=
y controls get added after the architecture is defined, as if security is a=
 gate at the end. It's not a gate at the end. You have to think about it fr=
om the beginning.
For example, you could have an architecture that allows forwarding raw user=
 credentials. That breaks audit trails and creates breach vectors. This wou=
ld happen inherently in a particular MCP configuration. You wouldn't be abl=
e to add a gate at the end to address it.
This is not just theoretical risk. Asana exposed a thousand customers' data=
 to each other for 34 days through an MCP misconfiguration. It wasn't expos=
ed to the wider internet=E2=80=94other customers could read each other's da=
ta. Customer A could see Customer B's internal documents, project plans, an=
d private communications. For over a month.
The root cause? They'd built their MCP integration with token passthrough t=
hat seemed convenient during development. The security review came later an=
d missed the cross-tenant exposure because the vulnerability was baked into=
 the architectural decision, not the implementation details.
You need to think about security first when architecting MCP and AI systems=
=2E Architectural decisions need to rec=
ognize different breach factors and se=
curity vectors with AI because language itself becomes a security risk.
This is one of the challenges in designing secure AI smart browsers. People=
 much smarter than me, like Simon Willison, have pointed out the difficulty=
 in designing a good smart browser because it's inherently vulnerable to la=
nguage. There's language everywhere on the internet. How can you secure tha=
t? How do you help the LLM distinguish between the context it ingests, whic=
h may contain dangerous instructions, and the specific prompt from the user=
?
It's one of the most vexing problems in security right now. That doesn't me=
an you shouldn't implement MCPs in production systems. None of this says do=
n't do it. Instead, treat security as a first-class object and design syste=
ms that are secure by default versus systems gated for security at the end.
Start by having the conversation. Ask yourself: how could an actor misuse t=
he path we've diagrammed in the architecture? That will get you farther tha=
n 90% of companies on security. Map out the attack vectors. Understand that=
 with MCP, you're creating pathways where natural language can traverse you=
r entire system. If someone can inject malicious instructions into your con=
text, they can potentially control your AI's behavior across all integrated=
 systems.
5. The Magical Performance Assumption
Most people assume: I have AI, I use MCP, I add external data, I'm going to=
 get better performance. It's going to be magical.
ARC papers show MCP integrations can cause performance decline. The measure=
d decline was 9.5% on average. Why?
The breakdown is sobering. Knowledge tasks see a 1.4% drop. That might seem=
 small until you realize that's your AI getting facts wrong more often. Rea=
soning tasks=E2=80=94where you need the AI to think through problems=E2=80=
=94show a 10.2% accuracy decline. Code generation, which should be one of A=
I's strongest capabilities, sees a 17% flat performance drop.
This comes from the paper "Help or Hurdle? Rethinking Model Context Protoco=
l Augmented Large Language Models," which came out on August 18th by Wei So=
ng, Haonan Zhang, and several other authors. It's peer-reviewed research, n=
ot opinion.
Fundamentally, external information introduces noise that can interfere wit=
h internal reasoning. When you think about MCP as a contextual orchestratio=
n layer, you must recognize that the context you provide can cloud its judg=
ment rather than improving it. If your context is not clean, if your contex=
t is dirty, if the external data you add clouds the issue, you will get per=
formance drops.
Think about this from the model's perspective. You've trained an LLM on cle=
an, curated data. It has learned patterns and relationships from billions o=
f examples. Now you're injecting random external context=E2=80=94maybe outd=
ated documentation, conflicting data sources, irrelevant information that h=
appens to match a keyword search. You're not enhancing its intelligence; yo=
u're giving it the AI equivalent of information overload.
That doesn't mean everybody gets performance drops. When I look at this, I =
see people using MCP for the wrong task and putting bad context in. Look wh=
at they got. Anecdotally, people also use MCP to see tremendous performance=
 gains. They complete tasks faster. Their chat experience has tools enabled=
=2E I benefit from MCPs and so do you w=
hen you use Claude and Claude calls to=
ols.
The difference? Successful implementations treat context quality like data =
quality=E2=80=94as a first-class concern. They curate what goes into MCP. T=
hey test whether adding context improves or degrades performance for specif=
ic tasks. They measure, iterate, and refine.
MCPs aren't inherently a problem. The problem is assuming that using MCPs m=
agically makes things better. Magically adding context doesn't make things =
better if the context is dirty. It comes back to data quality. You have to =
think about data quality rather than making magical performance assumptions=
=2E
6. The Microservices Everywhere Trap
I've seen architectures where developers tell me every microservice will ge=
t its own MCP server for flexibility. It looks beautiful on the whiteboard.
The reality? It's incredibly hard to maintain all those servers. One compro=
mised MCP server can expose the entire service mesh. The network overhead i=
s significant because each MCP call adds network hops and authentication ov=
erhead.
Let me paint the real picture of what this looks like in production. You ha=
ve 50 microservices. Each has its own MCP server. That's 50 different confi=
gurations to maintain, 50 different security policies to enforce, 50 differ=
ent points of failure. Your DevOps team now spends more time managing MCP s=
ervers than actually improving your product.
The authentication overhead compounds. Each MCP server needs to authenticat=
e with each service it talks to. Each service needs to authenticate with ea=
ch MCP server. You've created an N-squared authentication matrix that would=
 make even the most patient security engineer weep.
When something goes wrong? Good luck debugging which of your 50 MCP servers=
 caused the problem. Your observability tools are drowning in noise from al=
l the inter-service communication. Your logs are a haystack where every pie=
ce of straw looks like a needle.
It doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to configure microservices t=
hat way. You can have MCP work within microservices, not as microservices. =
You can have a federated security gateway with centralized policy enforceme=
nt so you're not enforcing security on every microservice separately.
The pattern that works: treat your microservice architecture as primary. MC=
P becomes a capability within specific services where intelligence is neede=
d. You might have three or four MCP instances across your entire architectu=
re, each serving a specific domain where contextual orchestration adds valu=
e. Not 50. Not one per service. Just enough to add intelligence where intel=
ligence matters.
This might seem abstract if you haven't worked in microservice architecture=
s. The key takeaway is that MCPs are not a substitute for APIs. MCPs aren't=
 built to be the front gate of microservices. If you're using a microservic=
e architecture, treat that architecture as core. Ensure you have federated =
security so you're not dealing with individual microservice layers, which g=
ood architectures already have. Then where you need MCP, place it within a =
particular microservice for inference.
7. The Real-Time Everything Delusion
This stems from the idea that chatbots needed real-time information, and MC=
P has enabled Claude to browse the web. There's a developer fantasy that ad=
ding MCP will get you real-time pricing or inventory or payment processing.
Don't use it that way. I've already discussed the latency issue. Please thi=
nk about a binary protocol that would be faster and more secure. Consider t=
hat you can use an ordinary real-time check from an API and get much more i=
n a secure manner.
Let me be specific about why this matters. MCP uses JSON-RPC as its protoco=
l. That's a text-based protocol. Every request and response is human-readab=
le JSON. That's great for debugging=E2=80=94you can literally read what's b=
eing sent. Text parsing is orders of magnitude slower than binary protocol =
processing.
A binary protocol would be 10x faster. You'd lose human-readable debugging.=
 The MCP designers made a conscious choice: debuggability over performance.=
 That tells you everything about where MCP belongs in your architecture.
MCPs are also not easily debuggable in the way you need for critical system=
s. If you're on a pathway like payment processing and you need to audit it,=
 you don't want to be in a position where MCP made an inference and you hav=
e to guess why the payment was denied. That doesn't provide auditability. Y=
ou need deterministic, traceable decision paths for anything involving mone=
y, safety, or compliance.
Consider the regulatory implications. Your payment processing is subject to=
 PCI compliance. Your audit logs need to show exactly why each transaction =
was approved or denied. "The AI thought it seemed fraudulent based on conte=
xt" is not an acceptable audit trail. You need specific rules, specific thr=
esholds, specific decision trees that can be reviewed and validated.
If it's safety critical, if it needs to be auditable, if it has to be real =
time, don't use MCP. MCP is fine for analysis and insights. It's fine for a=
n intelligence layer. Do not put it in the pathway of a direct protocol for=
 an operational system.
Where MCP Actually Excels
We've covered seven issues with MCP: the real-time everything delusion, mic=
roservices everywhere trap, magical performance assumptions, security theat=
er, hot path placement, context equaling data confusion, and the universal =
API router fallacy. All are misconceptions.
How do we think about MCP correctly?
MCP excels at background analysis and reporting. When you need to understan=
d patterns across multiple data sources, when you need to generate insights=
 that require connecting dots across systems, MCP shines. It can take its t=
ime, pull context from multiple sources, and generate genuinely intelligent=
 analysis.
It excels at cross-system workflow orchestration. When you have a complex b=
usiness process that touches multiple systems and requires intelligent deci=
sion-making at each step, MCP can orchestrate that beautifully. Not in real=
-time, but in near-time where a few seconds of latency is acceptable.
It excels at content generation. Need to create reports that pull from mult=
iple data sources? Need to generate documentation that reflects your actual=
 system state? MCP can do that better than any other integration approach b=
ecause it understands context, not just data.
It excels at summarizing content. When you have massive amounts of unstruct=
ured data across systems and need to make sense of it, MCP's ability to pul=
l context and generate summaries is unmatched.
It excels at complex multi-step processes where two to three seconds of lat=
ency is fine. Think approval workflows, report generation, intelligent rout=
ing decisions=E2=80=94anywhere that intelligence matters more than speed.
MCP is not for product catalog lookups. MCP is not for payment processing. =
MCP is not for real-time pricing or real-time anything. MCP is not for a cr=
itical path that requires sub-200 millisecond response times. It won't get =
there. MCP is not for safety-critical control systems.
The Architecture That Actually Works
If you want to implement MCP successfully and hit the leverage point that e=
nables successful AI implementation=E2=80=94because so much of this involve=
s integration of data and how you understand data in LLMs=E2=80=94understan=
d that MCP is for the intelligence layer.
Let MCP orchestrate insights for you. Let it use the inference you pay for =
to get you intelligence. Have a separate transaction layer with direct APIs=
 that handle operations. This isn't complicated, but it requires discipline=
=2E
Your architecture should look like this: direct APIs handle all customer-fa=
cing operations. They're fast, deterministic, and scalable. MCP sits adjace=
nt to this, processing intelligence requests asynchronously. When a custome=
r searches for a product, your API returns results instantly from your cach=
ed catalog. Meanwhile, MCP might analyze that search pattern along with hun=
dreds of others to improve your recommendation engine for tomorrow.
Design controls for security before you design the architecture. Know your =
constraints, your boundaries, and your threat vectors. Understand that with=
 AI and MCP, language itself becomes an attack vector. Design accordingly.
Know your latency requirements and performance expectations before choosing=
 a pathway or architecture. If you need sub-second responses, MCP is not yo=
ur answer. If you need audit trails for compliance, MCP is not your answer.=
 If you need to handle millions of operations per second, MCP is not your a=
nswer.
If you need to understand complex patterns across systems, if you need to g=
enerate intelligent insights from disparate data sources, if you need to or=
chestrate workflows that require actual reasoning=E2=80=94that's where MCP =
becomes invaluable.
The Bottom Line
If, as the MIT headline says, 95% of AI projects fail due to integration bo=
ttlenecks, getting MCP architectural placement right may be the difference =
between joining that failure rate and getting in the 5% that succeed.
MCP is becoming industry standard for a reason. None of this should be read=
 as don't use MCP. I love MCP, I appreciate it. I use it every day when I i=
nteract with Claude or ChatGPT. The tools these systems can call, the conte=
xt they can access=E2=80=94that's all MCP, and it's remarkable when used co=
rrectly.
Because it's popular and because people misunderstand how LLMs work, these =
seven misconceptions crop up constantly. They doom integrations. They poiso=
n people's thinking about LLMs and MCPs. People think AI won't deliver ROI.
The problem isn't AI. The problem is you asked MCP to do what it was never =
designed to do. MCP is designed to be a tool-calling utility for an LLM cha=
t experience. That was the original design. It was built to let chat interf=
aces interact with external systems in an intelligent way, with acceptable =
latency for a conversational interface.
If you're putting it into a situation outside that latency envelope, where =
you're not asking it to infer, where you're giving it dirty data, where you=
're exposing it to customers in an insecure way, you can't blame MCP for fa=
iling. That's using the wrong tool for the job. That's using a hammer on yo=
ur pipes, which some plumbers will do, but generally isn't recommended.
Use your MCP correctly. Use it as an intelligence layer, separate it from o=
perations. If you're using microservices architectures, don't treat MCPs li=
ke a silver bullet. Understand its constraints, respect its limitations, an=
d leverage its strengths.
The organizations succeeding with AI aren't the ones with the biggest model=
s or the most compute. They're the ones that understand architectural place=
ment. They know where each component belongs, what each technology can and =
cannot do, and they design accordingly.
MCP is a powerful tool. Used correctly, it's the difference between AI that=
 generates pretty demos and AI that delivers business value. Used incorrect=
ly, it's the difference between a successful implementation and joining the=
 95% failure rate.
Get your MCP architecture right. Your AI implementation depends on it.

 addresses the critical gap between Model Context Protocol's promise and it=

 to implement MCP without creating security disasters (Part 1) and where MC=
P belongs architecturally (Part 2). Most teams put MCP in customer-facing s=

ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">MCP adds latency. You cannot route your A=
PI calls through MCP as some people attempt because it will kill performanc=
e. It adds between 300 and 800 milliseconds of latency on each call, plus t=
he cost of inference on top of that.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=

gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">MCP provides data retrieva=
l. People assume they can use it for database queries. That's incorrect.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">More accurately, MCP provides contextual orchestration across=
 multiple systems. That distinction matters because it enables MCP to orche=
strate insights about data in background processes. You should not treat it=
 as equivalent to a SQL query for data retrieval.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =
0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This has =
massive cost implications. Studies have shown anywhere between a 3.25x and =
236x increase in input tokens with MCP integrations. ARC published this dat=
a=E2=80=94it's mind-boggling that this is an actual study. Even at the low =
end, you're tripling your token costs. At the high end, you're increasing t=
hem by two orders of magnitude.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The reason costs explode is=
 that MCPs dramatically increase the context available to inference by a fa=
ctor of up to 100 or more. It's a massive additional piece of context. MCP =
should help you orchestrate which context you're calling for a particular t=
ask. It should not serve as your universal data retrieval layer. That waste=
s money and won't get better results than using SQL directly.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

belongs in Redis or Elasticsearch where you can retrieve it in milliseconds=
. MCP should orchestrate insights about patterns in that data, understand r=
elationships between products, and generate recommendations based on comple=
x criteria. One is operational data access. The other is intelligence gener=
ation. Confusing them is like using a Ferrari to deliver pizza=E2=80=94tech=

possible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=

r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Consider the numbers. =
You have 5,000 operations per second and your API handles millions without =
issue. With MCP in the path, your API would be fine, but MCP is throttling =
and dying. MCP is in trouble because it wasn't designed to handle productio=
n traffic.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

 this lesson expensively. A financial services company put MCP in their rea=

engineering retrospective.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

beginning.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For example, you could have an architecture that=
 allows forwarding raw user credentials. That breaks audit trails and creat=

 need to think about security first when architecting MCP and AI systems. A=
rchitectural decisions need to recognize different breach factors and secur=

rs. People much smarter than me, like Simon Willison, have pointed out the =
difficulty in designing a good smart browser because it's inherently vulner=
able to language. There's language everywhere on the internet. How can you =
secure that? How do you help the LLM distinguish between the context it ing=
ests, which may contain dangerous instructions, and the specific prompt fro=
m the user?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=

y right now. That doesn't mean you shouldn't implement MCPs in production s=
ystems. None of this says don't do it. Instead, treat security as a first-c=
lass object and design systems that are secure by default versus systems ga=
ted for security at the end.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=

on. Ask yourself: how could an actor misuse the path we've diagrammed in th=
e architecture? That will get you farther than 90% of companies on security=
. Map out the attack vectors. Understand that with MCP, you're creating pat=
hways where natural language can traverse your entire system. If someone ca=

 Why?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=

px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Fundamentally=
, external information introduces noise that can interfere with internal re=
asoning. When you think about MCP as a contextual orchestration layer, you =
must recognize that the context you provide can cloud its judgment rather t=
han improving it. If your context is not clean, if your context is dirty, i=
f the external data you add clouds the issue, you will get performance drop=
s.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Think about this from the model's perspective. You've tr=
ained an LLM on clean, curated data. It has learned patterns and relationsh=
ips from billions of examples. Now you're injecting random external context=
=E2=80=94maybe outdated documentation, conflicting data sources, irrelevant=
 information that happens to match a keyword search. You're not enhancing i=

.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">That doesn't mean everybody gets performance drops. When =
I look at this, I see people using MCP for the wrong task and putting bad c=
ontext in. Look what they got. Anecdotally, people also use MCP to see trem=
endous performance gains. They complete tasks faster. Their chat experience=
 has tools enabled. I benefit from MCPs and so do you when you use Claude a=
nd Claude calls tools.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=

ations treat context quality like data quality=E2=80=94as a first-class con=
cern. They curate what goes into MCP. They test whether adding context impr=
oves or degrades performance for specific tasks. They measure, iterate, and=
 refine.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=

ssuming that using MCPs magically makes things better. Magically adding con=
text doesn't make things better if the context is dirty. It comes back to d=
ata quality. You have to think about data quality rather than making magica=
l performance assumptions.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"pos=

e Trap</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">I've seen architectures where developers tell me ev=
ery microservice will get its own MCP server for flexibility. It looks beau=
tiful on the whiteboard.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The reality? It's incredibly hard =
to maintain all those servers. One compromised MCP server can expose the en=
tire service mesh. The network overhead is significant because each MCP cal=
l adds network hops and authentication overhead.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Let me pai=
nt the real picture of what this looks like in production. You have 50 micr=
oservices. Each has its own MCP server. That's 50 different configurations =
to maintain, 50 different security policies to enforce, 50 different points=
 of failure. Your DevOps team now spends more time managing MCP servers tha=
n actually improving your product.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The authentication overh=
ead compounds. Each MCP server needs to authenticate with each service it t=
alks to. Each service needs to authenticate with each MCP server. You've cr=
eated an N-squared authentication matrix that would make even the most pati=
ent security engineer weep.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When something goes wrong? Good=
 luck debugging which of your 50 MCP servers caused the problem. Your obser=
vability tools are drowning in noise from all the inter-service communicati=
on. Your logs are a haystack where every piece of straw looks like a needle=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">It doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to configu=
re microservices that way. You can have MCP work within microservices, not =
as microservices. You can have a federated security gateway with centralize=
d policy enforcement so you're not enforcing security on every microservice=
 separately.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The pattern that works: treat your microservic=
e architecture as primary. MCP becomes a capability within specific service=
s where intelligence is needed. You might have three or four MCP instances =
across your entire architecture, each serving a specific domain where conte=
xtual orchestration adds value. Not 50. Not one per service. Just enough to=
 add intelligence where intelligence matters.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This might se=
em abstract if you haven't worked in microservice architectures. The key ta=
keaway is that MCPs are not a substitute for APIs. MCPs aren't built to be =
the front gate of microservices. If you're using a microservice architectur=
e, treat that architecture as core. Ensure you have federated security so y=
ou're not dealing with individual microservice layers, which good architect=
ures already have. Then where you need MCP, place it within a particular mi=
croservice for inference.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"posi=

26px;font-size: 16px;">This stems from the idea that chatbots needed real-t=
ime information, and MCP has enabled Claude to browse the web. There's a de=
veloper fantasy that adding MCP will get you real-time pricing or inventory=
 or payment processing.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Don't use it that way. I've already=
 discussed the latency issue. Please think about a binary protocol that wou=
ld be faster and more secure. Consider that you can use an ordinary real-ti=
me check from an API and get much more in a secure manner.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
Let me be specific about why this matters. MCP uses JSON-RPC as its protoco=
l. That's a text-based protocol. Every request and response is human-readab=
le JSON. That's great for debugging=E2=80=94you can literally read what's b=
eing sent. Text parsing is orders of magnitude slower than binary protocol =
processing.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">A binary protocol would be 10x faster. You'd lo=
se human-readable debugging. The MCP designers made a conscious choice: deb=
uggability over performance. That tells you everything about where MCP belo=
ngs in your architecture.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">MCPs are also not easily debuggab=
le in the way you need for critical systems. If you're on a pathway like pa=
yment processing and you need to audit it, you don't want to be in a positi=
on where MCP made an inference and you have to guess why the payment was de=
nied. That doesn't provide auditability. You need deterministic, traceable =
decision paths for anything involving money, safety, or compliance.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Consider the regulatory implications. Your payment processing is s=
ubject to PCI compliance. Your audit logs need to show exactly why each tra=
nsaction was approved or denied. &quot;The AI thought it seemed fraudulent =
based on context&quot; is not an acceptable audit trail. You need specific =
rules, specific thresholds, specific decision trees that can be reviewed an=
d validated.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If it's safety critical, if it needs to be aud=
itable, if it has to be real time, don't use MCP. MCP is fine for analysis =
and insights. It's fine for an intelligence layer. Do not put it in the pat=
hway of a direct protocol for an operational system.</p><h2 class=3D"header=

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Because it's popular and because people misunderstand how LLMs=
 work, these seven misconceptions crop up constantly. They doom integration=
s. They poison people's thinking about LLMs and MCPs. People think AI won't=
 deliver ROI.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The problem isn't AI. The problem is you aske=
d MCP to do what it was never designed to do. MCP is designed to be a tool-=
calling utility for an LLM chat experience. That was the original design. I=
t was built to let chat interfaces interact with external systems in an int=
elligent way, with acceptable latency for a conversational interface.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">If you're putting it into a situation outside that latency envel=
ope, where you're not asking it to infer, where you're giving it dirty data=
, where you're exposing it to customers in an insecure way, you can't blame=
 MCP for failing. That's using the wrong tool for the job. That's using a h=
ammer on your pipes, which some plumbers will do, but generally isn't recom=
mended.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">Use your MCP correctly. Use it as an intelligence l=
ayer, separate it from operations. If you're using microservices architectu=
res, don't treat MCPs like a silver bullet. Understand its constraints, res=
pect its limitations, and leverage its strengths.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =
0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The organ=
izations succeeding with AI aren't the ones with the biggest models or the =
most compute. They're the ones that understand architectural placement. The=
y know where each component belongs, what each technology can and cannot do=
, and they design accordingly.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">MCP is a powerful tool. Used=
 correctly, it's the difference between AI that generates pretty demos and =
AI that delivers business value. Used incorrectly, it's the difference betw=
een a successful implementation and joining the 95% failure rate.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">Get your MCP architecture right. Your AI implementation depends on i=
