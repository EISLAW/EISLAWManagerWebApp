AZERBAIJAN IS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THE LONG HAUL [3]
THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE, BUT ITS ALLIANCES WITH TURKEY AND ISRAEL PUT IT IN A TOUGH POSITION.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
Azerbaijan’s growing involvement in the areas to its south indicates the natural contiguity of the Middle East and the Caucasus. Now that Russia and Iran have weakened, Baku has an opportunity to
emerge as a budding middle power with interests throughout Eurasia. Thanks to its location along the land bridge that connects the Caspian and Black seas as well as Russia and Iran, Azerbaijan can be
expected to play a key role in shaping this strategic environment. As it does, it will have to balance the imperatives of its two regional allies: Turkey and Israel.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa paid a state visit to Azerbaijan on July 12-13. He held discussions with his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, the second such meeting since April. A key outcome
of the visit was an energy agreement whereby Azerbaijan will export natural gas to Syria via Turkey to help alleviate energy shortages brought on by years of conflict. Within days of the visit, Israel
struck Syrian forces in Damascus and in the southwestern province of Sweida, where factions allied with al-Sharaa’s government have been attacking an Israel-aligned Druze minority.
[The Caucasus and Greater Middle East] [4]

Modern Azerbaijan is relatively new at addressing situations like this on its periphery. Azerbaijan had been cut off from the Middle East since Imperial Russia took it from the Persian Empire in the
early 19th century. It continued to be isolated well after it became a sovereign state in the early 1990s when the Soviet Union imploded. Turkey and Israel were among the first countries to recognize
newly independent Azerbaijan in late 1991. But Tehran, sensing an opportunity to spread its Islamist ideology and its influence northward into its secular Shiite-majority neighbor, tried to undermine
the young regime. Baku was able to thwart these efforts by rallying Iran's minority ethnic Azeri population, which, though Shiite, maintains its distinct Turkic identity. All the while, Azerbaijan was
still within Russia’s sphere of influence – which helped prevent Iran from exploiting its alliance with Azerbaijan's rival, Armenia. And so, for almost three decades, Azerbaijan was unable to pay
much attention to the Middle East. To the extent it did, it forged closer ties with Turkey and Israel.
The basis of its relationship with Israel was close military and intelligence cooperation, especially with regard to their common enemy, Iran. Since 2006, Azerbaijan has supplied as much as 40 percent
of Israel’s crude oil needs through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which traverses Georgia and Turkey. After Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power in Turkey in 2003, the Turkish-Azerbaijani
relationship turned into a strategic alliance based on shared ethnicity, language, religion and geostrategic objectives. The culmination of this process was the 2020 war between Azerbaijan and
Armenia, in which Baku – with strong military and intelligence support from Ankara – decisively defeated Armenia and regained control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
The outcome of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War tipped the regional balance of power in Azerbaijan’s favor. It also showed Baku that Moscow was no longer as influential in the South Caucasus as it
used to be, and it changed the government’s attitude toward Tehran, which was put on the defensive. (Armenia, Iran's ally, was weakened, and its rival, Turkey, was now competing with Russia.)
Russia’s position has gotten only worse over the course of its war with Ukraine.
This explains why, in just the past year, Azerbaijan has acted more assertively against Russia, as evidenced by its response to the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight from Baku to Chechnya. Now
that it has made progress toward a peace agreement with Armenia – the outcome of a July 10 meeting between Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan – Azerbaijan feels secure and
confident in the South Caucasus. Hence the uptick in attention it is giving the Middle East.
Baku is also buoyed by the shakeup in Tehran, not to mention the broader Middle East, resulting from the war between Israel and Iran. Over the past two decades, Azerbaijan and Israel have developed
close intelligence cooperation to deal with the shared threat of Iran. While Iran has not officially accused Azerbaijan of aiding Israel last month, there is growing talk within Iranian media of
Azerbaijan’s close ties with Israel in the wake of the Syrian president’s visit to Baku. Add to this that Iran is in the middle of a major leadership transition, and Azerbaijan is seriously
considering its options as it enhances its role in the Middle East.
How Iran manages its transition will be key for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey are in the process of developing the Zangezur corridor through southern Armenia, a critical connector in the broader
Trans-Caspian International Transport Corridor that links Central Asia to Europe. Iran deeply opposes the Zangezur project because it has security concerns over this budding Turkey-Azerbaijan axis.
Meanwhile, what kind of regime emerges from the pending Iranian transition is of utmost significance to the Azerbaijanis. Even if the nationalists triumph over the Islamists who have dominated Iran
for so long, the regime would still view Baku with deep suspicion. Given the stress on the Iranian political system, Azerbaijan has much to fear from the chaos of internal power struggles in its
southern neighbor.
In the meantime, Baku is already enhancing its participation in broader regional issues. It has improved ties with fellow energy-rich Gulf Arab states like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,
and it has played a crucial role in mediating talks between Turkey and Israel over Syria, where both countries control territory. Three rounds of meetings have taken place in the past three months
already.
Indeed, Syria is a problem for Azerbaijan. Baku is caught in the middle of a long-term struggle between its two closest Middle Eastern allies over the fate of the Levantine nation. Navigating that
struggle will be a challenge, especially in light of Israel’s attacks on Syrian government positions over the past few days. The government in Damascus is supported by Turkey, as well as by the
region’s Arab states, all of which have an interest in seeing the new regime consolidate its power, not fall to Israeli barrages. Israel is worried that al-Sharaa’s movement, which is Islamist, is
allied with other radical factions more hostile to its interests.
The latest feud between the Syrian government and its allies with the Israel-aligned Druze factions places a great deal of strain on Turkey and, by extension, Azerbaijan. It’s unclear how Baku will
deal with this problem, but clearly Azerbaijan is becoming more deeply involved in the Middle East – and it’s in it for the long haul.

 weakened, Baku has an opportunity to emerge as a budding middle power with=
 interests throughout Eurasia. Thanks to its location along the land bridge=
 that connects the Caspian and Black seas as well as Russia and Iran, Azerb=
aijan can be expected to play a key role in shaping this strategic environm=

hmed al-Sharaa paid a state visit to Azerbaijan on July 12-13. He held disc=
ussions with his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, the second such mee=

y Azerbaijan will export natural gas to Syria via Turkey to help alleviate =
energy shortages brought on by years of conflict. Within days of the visit,=
 Israel struck Syrian forces in Damascus and in the southwestern province o=
f Sweida, where factions allied with al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s government have be=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Modern Azerbaijan =
is relatively new at addressing situations like this on its periphery. Azer=
baijan had been cut off from the Middle East since Imperial Russia took it =
from the Persian Empire in the early 19th century. It continued to be isola=
ted well after it became a sovereign state in the early 1990s when the Sovi=
et Union imploded. Turkey and Israel were among the first countries to reco=
gnize newly independent Azerbaijan in late 1991. But Tehran, sensing an opp=
ortunity to spread its Islamist ideology and its influence northward into i=
ts secular Shiite-majority neighbor, tried to undermine the young regime. B=
aku was able to thwart these efforts by rallying Iran's minority ethnic Aze=
ri population, which, though Shiite, maintains its distinct Turkic identity=
. All the while, Azerbaijan was still within Russia=E2=80=99s sphere of inf=
luence =E2=80=93 which helped prevent Iran from exploiting its alliance wit=
h Azerbaijan's rival, Armenia. And so, for almost three decades, Azerbaijan=
 was unable to pay much attention to the Middle East. To the extent it did,=
 it forged closer ties with Turkey and Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The basis of its r=
elationship with Israel was close military and intelligence cooperation, es=
pecially with regard to their common enemy, Iran. Since 2006, Azerbaijan ha=
s supplied as much as 40 percent of Israel=E2=80=99s crude oil needs throug=
h the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which traverses Georgia and Turkey. Aft=
er Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power in Turkey in 2003, the Turkish-Azerba=
ijani relationship turned into a strategic alliance based on shared ethnici=
ty, language, religion and geostrategic objectives. The culmination of this=
 process was the 2020 war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in which Baku =E2=
=80=93 with strong military and intelligence support from Ankara =E2=80=93 =
decisively defeated Armenia and regained control over the Nagorno-Karabakh =
region.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The outcome of the=
 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War tipped the regional balance of power in Azerba=
ijan=E2=80=99s favor. It also showed Baku that Moscow was no longer as infl=
uential in the South Caucasus as it used to be, and it changed the governme=
nt=E2=80=99s attitude toward Tehran, which was put on the defensive. (Armen=
ia, Iran's ally, was weakened, and its rival, Turkey, was now competing wit=
h Russia.) Russia=E2=80=99s position has gotten only worse over the course =
of its war with Ukraine.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This explains why,=
 in just the past year, Azerbaijan has acted more assertively against Russi=
a, as evidenced by its response to the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines fl=
ight from Baku to Chechnya. Now that it has made progress toward a peace ag=
reement with Armenia =E2=80=93 the outcome of a July 10 meeting between Ali=
yev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan =E2=80=93 Azerbaijan feels =
secure and confident in the South Caucasus. Hence the uptick in attention i=
t is giving the Middle East.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Baku is also buoye=
d by the shakeup in Tehran, not to mention the broader Middle East, resulti=
ng from the war between Israel and Iran. Over the past two decades, Azerbai=
jan and Israel have developed close intelligence cooperation to deal with t=
he shared threat of Iran. While Iran has not officially accused Azerbaijan =
of aiding Israel last month, there is growing talk within Iranian media of =
Azerbaijan=E2=80=99s close ties with Israel in the wake of the Syrian presi=
dent=E2=80=99s visit to Baku. Add to this that Iran is in the middle of a m=
ajor leadership transition, and Azerbaijan is seriously considering its opt=
ions as it enhances its role in the Middle East.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">How Iran manages i=
ts transition will be key for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey are in the =
process of developing the Zangezur corridor through southern Armenia, a cri=
tical connector in the broader Trans-Caspian International Transport Corrid=
or that links Central Asia to Europe. Iran deeply opposes the Zangezur proj=
ect because it has security concerns over this budding Turkey-Azerbaijan ax=
is. Meanwhile, what kind of regime emerges from the pending Iranian transit=
ion is of utmost significance to the Azerbaijanis. Even if the nationalists=
 triumph over the Islamists who have dominated Iran for so long, the regime=
 would still view Baku with deep suspicion. Given the stress on the Iranian=
 political system, Azerbaijan has much to fear from the chaos of internal p=
ower struggles in its southern neighbor.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the meantime, B=
aku is already enhancing its participation in broader regional issues. It h=
as improved ties with fellow energy-rich Gulf Arab states like the United A=
rab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and it has played a crucial role in mediatin=
g talks between Turkey and Israel over Syria, where both countries control =
territory. Three rounds of meetings have taken place in the past three mont=
hs already.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Indeed, Syria is a=
 problem for Azerbaijan. Baku is caught in the middle of a long-term strugg=
le between its two closest Middle Eastern allies over the fate of the Levan=
tine nation. Navigating that struggle will be a challenge, especially in li=
ght of Israel=E2=80=99s attacks on Syrian government positions over the pas=
t few days. The government in Damascus is supported by Turkey, as well as b=
y the region=E2=80=99s Arab states, all of which have an interest in seeing=
 the new regime consolidate its power, not fall to Israeli barrages. Israel=
 is worried that al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s movement, which is Islamist, is allied=
 with other radical factions more hostile to its interests.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The latest feud be=
tween the Syrian government and its allies with the Israel-aligned Druze fa=
ctions places a great deal of strain on Turkey and, by extension, Azerbaija=
n. It=E2=80=99s unclear how Baku will deal with this problem, but clearly A=
zerbaijan is becoming more deeply involved in the Middle East =E2=80=93 and=
 it=E2=80=99s in it for the long haul.</p>
