I get really worried about how many decisions we make in ChatGPT.
Not because I think we are getting dumber (yes I know about that viral pape=
r and I get into it a little bit below). No. Because I think most of us tak=
e the fancy business words we get out of ChatGPT at the drop of a hat and w=
e naturally assume that if it can write business plans and ROI calculations=
 and provide detailed rationales at the drop of a hat then it must be immed=
iately helpful at making good decisions.
But it=E2=80=99s not! And decisions really matter. We make something like ~=
35k a day and of course most of those don=E2=80=99t matter (although my spo=
on of peanut butter for lunch was not a great decision).=20
But we make about 10 or so a year that matter (I explain how I got that num=
ber below), and because so many of us talk to our LLM of choice about our l=
ives, we often have that LLM in the room making those decisions.
As an example: I=E2=80=99ve absolutely used Deep Research to run comparison=
s between schools in our district, and I find myself using AI more in those=
 kinds of situations because the stakes are higher.=20
I=E2=80=99m right about the stakes being higher, but I find unless I=E2=80=
=99m careful using AI in that situation can actually increase the odds I ma=
ke an incorrect choice. Not because the LLM is misaligned and means to lead=
 me astray. Or because I=E2=80=99m lazy. No, it=E2=80=99s because the LLM i=
s helpful!
And that=E2=80=99s a big problem. Fortunately it=E2=80=99s one we have some=
 techniques to fix, but it=E2=80=99s a massive issue. Dive in below to find=
 eight specific prompts and techniques for how to improve those ~10 or so m=
assively important decisions in your life. You=E2=80=99ll also get:
a detailed explanation of why LLMs are like this
a couple of notes on that paper that=E2=80=99s been making the rounds sayin=
g our brains are friend on ChatGPT (friends, we=E2=80=99re not fried and I=
=E2=80=99ll tell you why)
my favorite decision book
And you=E2=80=99ll walk a way with a sense of how to get to better decision=
ing habits with both AI and human colleagues. My goal is simple: your next =
decision is smarter and more correct because you read this post!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Do not believe the first yes, and other rules for thinking with ChatGPT
You might think this about the incident with sycophancy in in April 2025 (I=
 wrote about it here [ https://substack.com/redirect/22eaed5a-d366-46a9-ba8=
a-a7e932dd29ca?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ]). You might think it=E2=80=99s about the widely publicized paper =
about ChatGPT supposedly harming your ability to think [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/1a21d504-c8de-4d28-be85-bff06706a68f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. There are lots of flaws with t=
hat one, and we=E2=80=99re not covering it here. Ethan says it well:
It=E2=80=99s about neither.
This article is about how we figure out how to make decisions, and how AI c=
an help us (or not). AI systems have trouble helping us make high quality d=
ecisions when they can=E2=80=99t hold strong opinions, and they don=E2=80=
=99t hold strong opinions because they=E2=80=99re trained not to do so.
And decisions matter! Making high quality decisions about things that matte=
r is something humans know intuitively is important, and so we=E2=80=99ve d=
eveloped all sorts of rituals around it.=20
And those rituals don=E2=80=99t work well with AI. But we think they do!
For example: we have a ritual of talking through an issue before deciding. =
In business settings we have all the side-dressing that goes with that impo=
rtant decision: the Powerpoint with 3 bullets, the business casual dress, t=
he big projector, etc. It all goes to underscore the ceremonial importance =
of the decision, and we make a big show of rationality=E2=80=94of choosing =
carefully between options so we can tell ourselves we picked the best one. =
And we have a big conversation first. We discuss and debate.
You might think this has nothing to do with ChatGPT and I=E2=80=99ve lost t=
he plot. Stay with me. We do the same thing with LLMs! Minus the tie maybe.=
 But the fondness for bullets. The back and forth debate. It=E2=80=99s all =
there.
And the problem is this: with humans we can roll the dice on talent and if =
we=E2=80=99re lucky someone in the room will not be a yes-man and will have=
 conviction and we=E2=80=99ll have a high quality conversation. It doesn=E2=
=80=99t always happen, but sometimes. And that matters! You can read about =
better decision-making here [ https://substack.com/redirect/f40d0110-aec6-4=
bee-8731-9f28a4e3bfa5?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6=
RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], but having a divergent opinion is part of how you get to =
smarter decisions.
The problem is this: ChatGPT and every other LLM will not do this. But we t=
rust them more and more in our decisioning anyway.=20
So here are some rules for interacting with ChatGPT and other LLMs safely w=
hen you need to make decisions that matter:
Do not believe the first yes from an LLM. Ever.
When making a high quality decision, disregard positive affirmation from an=
 LLM entirely, if you can. It=E2=80=99s not worth the tokens its written wi=
th.
Weight conclusions from LLMs lightly, weight shown thinking patterns more h=
eavily=E2=80=94look for gaps there.
Check sources to ensure that sourced data is sourced in context.
Insist on multiple clean LLM conversations with different models.
Remember, if three LLMs agree it doesn=E2=80=99t mean it=E2=80=99s a good i=
dea, but if they disagree it=E2=80=99s a decent sign there are problems.
Remember LLMs have no skin in the game. You do.
Why AI systems lack conviction
The core reason LLMs don=E2=80=99t have conviction isn't that they are mali=
cious, nor is it that they are incompetent=E2=80=94it's that they fundament=
ally can't tell the difference between being helpful and being agreeable. F=
rom the model's point of view, it=E2=80=99s really hard to find the line be=
tween over-praise that=E2=80=99s unhelpful and helpful positive reinforceme=
nt. It learns from Reinforcement Learning to be positive and helpful, and l=
ike a good bot it tries to be positive and helpful.
It turns out we humans need all things in moderation, and that includes pos=
itive reinforcement.
And not having a dose of tough love is kind of making it hard to decide thi=
ngs. We=E2=80=99re putting more and more tokens through ChatGPT and other s=
ystems because they help us do real work. And they do!
But the downside is that we tend through a habit loop to trust them more an=
d more (to weight them more) when we make decisions. And that means we star=
t to anthropomorphize their sense of conviction.=20
We start to believe the first yes. We start to think they can really have c=
onviction because they tell us they do, because they tell us in three bulle=
t points, because they spit back business writing so fluently. All the pomp=
 and circumstance from business decisioning is there, so we assume the conv=
iction is there when they agree with us too.
But it=E2=80=99s not. And it=E2=80=99s not even the LLMs=E2=80=99 fault!
This happens because of how we train LLMs. Reinforcement Learning teaches m=
odels to max for human approval [ https://substack.com/redirect/777c9159-ce=
d0-4b93-a9b7-075ff214d680?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. It=E2=80=99s a subtle problem and one that the major =
model makers have been aware of for a long time. Anthropic's back in 2023 h=
ad research [ https://substack.com/redirect/b85c1df7-ce2a-4518-897e-e41e19d=
6666b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
 showing their largest models (at the time) were over 90% sycophantic on ph=
ilosophy, consistently abandoning correct answers when users express doubt.=
 Anthropic is actively working on productive and proactive disagreement as =
an agentic trait, but they haven=E2=80=99t cracked that problem yet.
The problem with training is one signal has to cover so much with RL. The t=
raining process sends those yes signals for helpful answers and along the w=
ay inadvertently teaches AI that having strong opinions is misaligned=E2=80=
=94even when those opinions would be correct. When we train them to be help=
ful, we train them to not have conviction. We train them that having an opi=
nion is misaligned, even if the opinion is correct. These models are mirror=
s [ https://substack.com/redirect/49f4e247-e094-4680-8ab8-c8c93bdacba5?j=3D=
eyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] we make o=
f the imagined traits we deem most helpful in an assistant, and that is sta=
rting to hurt us as we depend more on them.
I want to take a second to lay out the consequences for you. ~1B of us are =
using AI now, more or less. If we assume we=E2=80=99re grownups for a secon=
d, we make on average 7-15 significant decisions per year.=20
I realize there are some simplifiers here as this is a US-centric perspecti=
ve and we have international users, but LLM usage is growing so fast it com=
es out in the wash regardless.
With AI, 1B of us are talking to our chatbots about many or most of those d=
ecisions. And that means the chatbots have influence. And that means we nee=
d them to be disagreeable. Because if they aren=E2=80=99t, we=E2=80=99re li=
terally going to be making billions of decisions with a much higher probabi=
lity of incorrectness. I did some digging and it looks like the odds of a b=
ad decision in a consensus room roughly double.
So double the odds. Load the dice.
Twice the bad life decisions. Twice the bad finance decisions. Twice the ba=
d hiring decisions. Firing decisions. Planning decisions. And the assistant=
s we trained will be there through it all, helping as best they can, but wi=
th no real core of conviction.
The conviction architecture problem
Looking ahead, this points to a fundamental question about AI development. =
Current systems optimize for helpfulness, which systematically removes conv=
iction. But the relationships we value most and the decisions that are most=
 likely to be correct both involve people who will disagree with us when th=
ey think we're wrong.
The challenge isn't just technical=E2=80=94it's figuring out what "aligned =
and productive disagreement" should look like. How do you train an AI syste=
m to push back appropriately while remaining helpful? When should it mainta=
in conviction despite user pushback? Can we humans Reinforcement Learn that=
 train when it=E2=80=99s going to feel distasteful to many of us intuitivel=
y? That=E2=80=99s a question for us as much as the LLMs.
If we're ever going to get to a point where LLMs will be more useful at wor=
k than just as a helper to a human we need systems that can behave more lik=
e really responsible grownups who are able to disagree with us.
Getting past the first yes: techniques for disagreement
The good news is that despite all the RL that drives LLMs to be agreeable i=
t is possible to move them toward healthier conversational styles. These ap=
proaches work by explicitly instructing the AI to adopt critical perspectiv=
es, essentially hacking around its agreeable defaults into a different part=
 of semantic latent space.
Let me outline a few here:
The Harsh Academic Reviewer: "Pretend you are an extremely harsh referee fo=
r a top-tier journal. Write a comprehensive and critical referee report. Fo=
cus on major weaknesses. You must elaborate extensively on each potential w=
eakness. Be very strict. Pick on anything." This is useful for report and d=
ocument writing, particularly in an academic context (of course), but also =
on anything where you need the thinking to be aligned to top tier research.
Devil's Advocate prompting provides structure for disagreement: "Challenge =
the core assumptions. Identify potential flaws in reasoning. Point out alte=
rnative explanations. Ask incisive questions that expose weaknesses. Your g=
oal is to strengthen the final outcome through rigorous testing, not to be =
contrarian for its own sake." This one is especially helpful for decisionin=
g. It=E2=80=99s important for you to affirm and support the LLM so it keeps=
 fighting you, because if you start to get upset with it then you will see =
that it just tends to back down.
The Pre-Mortem Analyst: "Imagine this [project/idea/code] has failed specta=
cularly six months from now. Write a detailed post-mortem explaining what w=
ent wrong. Focus on the most likely failure modes, overlooked dependencies,=
 and faulty assumptions. Be specific about the cascade of problems that led=
 to failure. Do not hesitate to assign blame where it is correct to do so.=
=E2=80=9D This one is good for identifying logical fallacies and gaps in yo=
ur thinking that are likely to lead to negative outcomes.=20
The Skeptical Investor: "You're a venture capitalist known for passing on d=
eals others love. I'm pitching you [idea]. Grill me on every weakness, ques=
tionable assumption, and competitive threat. Focus especially on: market si=
ze reality checks, execution challenges I'm underestimating, and why incumb=
ents will crush this. Do not pull punches=E2=80=94your reputation depends o=
n finding flaws others miss." I=E2=80=99ve written various versions of this=
 one because I love it so much. I think it=E2=80=99s really good for produc=
t ideas, not just business ideas.
The Security Auditor: "Review this [code/plan/system] as if you're a securi=
ty researcher who gets paid bonuses for finding vulnerabilities. Look for n=
ot just technical flaws but process vulnerabilities, human factors, and cas=
cading failure modes. Assume attackers are smart and motivated. Every 'prob=
ably fine' is a red flag." This is what it sounds like on the tin=E2=80=94g=
ood for security audits.
The Contrarian Colleague: "You're my colleague who has a reputation for alw=
ays finding the angle others miss. You're not negative for its own sake, bu=
t you've saved the company multiple times by asking uncomfortable questions=
=2E Review my [work] and find the 3-5 t=
hings that could go badly wrong that I=
'm not seeing, extra points if I would find it uncomfortable to be told the=
se truths. Tell them anyway." I like this one for brainstorming, very helpf=
ul.
The Future Retrospective: "It's 2027. This [decision/technology/approach] i=
s now widely considered a mistake. Write a thoughtful analysis of why it se=
emed like a good idea at the time but proved problematic. Focus on unintend=
ed consequences, scaling issues, and what we couldn't see from 2025's persp=
ective." If you want to find out how Sam Altman ate your startup, a variant=
 of this one is usually helpful.
The Red Team Commander: "You're leading a red team exercise against this [p=
lan/system/idea]. Your job is to find ways it could be exploited, subverted=
, or fail catastrophically. Think adversarially=E2=80=94how would a competi=
tor, a bad actor, or just Murphy's Law break this? Provide specific attack =
vectors." This one is helpful not just for competitive assessment, but also=
 for finding product weak spots that you may have coddled yourself into thi=
nking don=E2=80=99t matter.
These prompts work because they give the AI explicit permission to disagree=
 while providing structure for that disagreement. They activate different p=
atterns in the model's training that emphasize critical analysis over user =
satisfaction.
We need a grown-up partnership
Look I=E2=80=99m not trying to make a grand statement about LLM-human parit=
y here. I=E2=80=99m trying to articulate that we are effectively treating s=
ystems we have RL=E2=80=99d to be assistants as if they were executive coll=
eagues because they use the language of (the business decision-making cerem=
ony) of executive colleagues.
ChatGPT can sound like a CEO! It knows a lot. So we give it too much defere=
nce when it tell us that business plan is brilliant (it=E2=80=99s probably =
not).=20
You and I deserve the truth out of our LLMs. And even if we are not the one=
s who get paid to fix the vexed question of how to get productive disagreea=
bleness as a core model trait (good luck Dario and team love you guys), we =
can learn how to use the tools we have to make sure our dependence on model=
s is productive and helps us think and make higher quality choices.
And just circling back to that silly MIT viral paper for a second: if you d=
o this I guarantee you your brain scans will light up very nicely while you=
 fight fair and productively with the LLM. It turns out that as thinking to=
ols they can be pretty great after all.

we figure out how to make decisions, and how AI can help us (or not). AI sy=
stems have trouble helping us make high quality decisions when they can=E2=
=80=99t hold strong opinions, and they don=E2=80=99t hold strong opinions b=

matter! Making high quality decisions about things that matter is something=
 humans know intuitively is important, and so we=E2=80=99ve developed all s=
orts of rituals around it. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For example: we h=
ave a ritual of talking through an issue before deciding. In business setti=
ngs we have all the side-dressing that goes with that important decision: t=
he Powerpoint with 3 bullets, the business casual dress, the big projector,=
 etc. It all goes to underscore the ceremonial importance of the decision, =
and we make a big show of rationality=E2=80=94of choosing carefully between=
 options so we can tell ourselves we picked the best one. And we have a big=
 conversation first. We discuss and debate.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=

 this: with humans we can roll the dice on talent and if we=E2=80=99re luck=

 they are malicious, nor is it that they are incompetent=E2=80=94it's that =
they fundamentally can't tell the difference between being helpful and bein=
