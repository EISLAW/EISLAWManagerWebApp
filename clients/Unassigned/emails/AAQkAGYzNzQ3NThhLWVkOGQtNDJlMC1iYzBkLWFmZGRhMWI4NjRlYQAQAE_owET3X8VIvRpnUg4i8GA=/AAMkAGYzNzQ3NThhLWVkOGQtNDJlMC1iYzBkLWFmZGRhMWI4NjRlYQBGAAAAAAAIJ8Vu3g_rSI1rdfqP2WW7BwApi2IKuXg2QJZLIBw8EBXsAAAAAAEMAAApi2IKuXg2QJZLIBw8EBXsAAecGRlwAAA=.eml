Scaling Reinforcement Learning for LLMs=20
Predictable Scaling of RL Compute (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/d8=
99b112-3592-45d7-916f-3b54ff3c8b88?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): A Meta & collaborators study provides the f=
irst large-scale analysis (400k GPU-hours!) of how RL fine-tuning scales fo=
r LLMs. They fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves and find that many de=
sign choices (loss aggregation, normalization, etc.) mainly affect compute =
efficiency but not final performance. With these insights, they introduce a=
 best-practice recipe =E2=80=9CScaleRL=E2=80=9D that extrapolates small-run=
 learning curves to predict final performance. Using ScaleRL, they successf=
ully forecast a 100k GPU-hour run=E2=80=99s result, moving RL training clos=
er to the predictability of pre-training.
=E2=80=9CMarkovian Thinker=E2=80=9D for Long Reasoning (paper [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/8c768927-6119-451a-b507-805880239dd4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): Long chain-of-thought =
reasoning typically forces an LLM agent to condition on an ever-growing pro=
mpt (making RL policies pay quadratic cost as thoughts get longer). Aghajoh=
ari et al. propose Markovian Thinking, reformulating the RL =E2=80=9Cthinki=
ng environment=E2=80=9D so the model only ever sees a fixed-size state. In =
their Delethink setup, reasoning is chunked into segments: the model genera=
tes a brief state summary at each chunk=E2=80=99s end, then resets context =
and continues fresh with that summary. This yields linear-time, constant-me=
mory scaling. A 1.5B model trained with Delethink can reason for 24k tokens=
 in 8k-token chunks, matching or beating a baseline trained with full 24k-t=
oken context. Even more impressively, it continues to improve with longer r=
easoning (96k tokens), while the baseline plateaus - at roughly one-quarter=
 of the computing cost (estimated 7 H100-months vs 27 for the baseline). Re=
designing the environment, not just the model, thus enables efficient, scal=
able long-term reasoning.
RL Fine-Tuning Unlocks Reasoning Abilities
Why RL Helps LLMs Reason (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/79afca73-55=
e0-428a-bb98-81cf1b70a6b8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): Tsilivis et al. tackle the question of how RL fine-t=
uning (after next-token pre-training) boosts reasoning. They introduce a th=
eoretical framework showing that after pre-training, applying RL enables mo=
dels to solve tasks requiring long chain-of-thought with far less data than=
 next-token prediction alone. Essentially, RL rewards the final outcome of =
a multi-step reasoning chain, letting the model leverage longer test-time c=
omputation (longer answers) to learn the task. For example, in a toy parity=
 task with mostly short examples, an RL-finetuned transformer generalizes c=
orrectly using long chains, whereas a purely next-token-trained one would n=
eed exponentially more data. They also confirm the effect on real models: R=
L finetuning LLaMA on mixture-of-experts math problems yields better genera=
lization by exploiting longer reasoning steps.
=E2=80=9CBase=E2=80=9D vs =E2=80=9CThinking=E2=80=9D Models - Knowing How v=
s When (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/559b6168-d66a-41ba-92fa-061c3=
a521e3a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0=
 ]): Are chain-of-thought =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D models fundamentally m=
ore capable, or just better at using base model skills? Venhoff et al. find=
 it=E2=80=99s largely the latter. By injecting small steering vectors into =
a frozen base model=E2=80=99s activations at just ~12% of positions, they c=
an trigger the model=E2=80=99s latent reasoning abilities and recover ~91% =
of the performance gap up to a full chain-of-thought trained model - all wi=
th no weight updates. This implies large pre-trained LLMs already =E2=80=9C=
know how=E2=80=9D to reason, and what specialized finetuning really does is=
 teach them when to deploy those skills. In other words, pre-training equip=
s the model with reasoning mechanisms, and post-training (=E2=80=9Cthinking=
=E2=80=9D model training) mainly teaches efficient use of those mechanisms =
at the right time. This insight reframes how we view advanced reasoning LLM=
s: much of the reasoning prowess was latent in the base model all along.
New Paradigms for LLM Agents and Tool-Use
Early Experience Instead of Pure Imitation (paper [ https://substack.com/re=
direct/3feb7bed-e145-489d-9b95-f27f488b1dbc?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88Y=
FxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): Meta=E2=80=99s* =E2=80=9CAgent Lea=
rning via Early Experience=E2=80=9D proposes a middle ground between static=
 imitation learning and full reinforcement learning. Rather than relying so=
lely on narrow expert demos (which don=E2=80=99t expose environment diversi=
ty), they let the agent collect its own interaction data without rewards - =
called =E2=80=9Cearly experience=E2=80=9D. Two uses of this data are explor=
ed: (1) Implicit world models, where the agent trains on its collected stat=
es to ground its policy in how the environment behaves, and (2) Self-reflec=
tion, where the agent learns from its mistakes (suboptimal actions) to impr=
ove reasoning. Across 8 environments, these strategies improve performance =
and out-of-domain generalization, effectively bridging the gap between imit=
ation and fully autonomous agents. Notably, even when eventual rewards are =
available, early experience provides a strong foundation that makes subsequ=
ent RL more effective.
Best Practices for Agentic RL (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/bfd15f=
41-12f1-4961-b5b1-5c01ba69c9a7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshg=
UC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): In =E2=80=9CDemystifying RL in Agentic Reasonin=
g,=E2=80=9D Yu et al. systematically evaluate how to get the most out of RL=
 when training tool-using LLM agents. They identify a few simple but powerf=
ul practices: (i) Use real, end-to-end tool-use trajectories rather than st=
itched-together snippets - this yields a much stronger initialization for s=
upervised fine-tuning and ensures diverse, model-aware experience data. Hig=
h-diversity datasets prevent the agent from overfitting and help sustain ex=
ploration. (ii) Employ exploration-friendly techniques - for example, allow=
ing higher clipping thresholds, shaping rewards over longer horizons, and m=
aintaining sufficient policy entropy - to encourage the agent to try novel =
solutions, greatly boosting RL training efficiency. (iii) Favor a deliberat=
ive reasoning strategy with fewer, more targeted tool calls over very frequ=
ent calls or overly verbose self-dialogues. In other words, teaching the ag=
ent to think a bit more before acting leads to better tool efficiency and f=
inal accuracy. Using these tips, they achieve state-of-the-art results on c=
hallenging benchmarks with smaller LLMs, even getting a 4B model to outperf=
orm a 32B model on agentic reasoning tasks. They also release a high-qualit=
y supervised and RL dataset of agent trajectories to help others replicate =
these gains.
Training-Free RL via Token Priors (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/34=
cea368-af43-49a0-94c9-def1182e5cf9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]): Reinforcement learning usually means updati=
ng model weights - but Cai et al. show you can get policy improvements with=
out any finetune. Their =E2=80=9CTraining-Free Group RPO=E2=80=9D method tr=
eats the base LLM as fixed and instead adjusts the output token distributio=
n on the fly using experience. During deployment, the agent generates multi=
ple rollouts; within each group of rollouts, the method computes a =E2=80=
=9Cgroup relative semantic advantage=E2=80=9D for tokens (think: which toke=
ns led to better outcomes) and distills this into a token-level prior to bi=
as the model=E2=80=99s next decisions. By iterating this process over a few=
 epochs (with only a handful of ground-truth examples as reference), the LL=
M acquires =E2=80=9Cexperiential knowledge=E2=80=9D that steers its outputs=
, all without gradient updates. In tasks like math reasoning and web search=
, adding this lightweight loop to a state-of-the-art agent (DeepSeek) signi=
ficantly improved out-of-domain performance. In fact, with only a few dozen=
 examples, the training-free approach outperformed fully finetuned smaller =
LLMs - at a fraction of the cost and time, since it avoids any traditional =
RL training phase.
Tensor Logic: Unifying Neural and Symbolic AI
Pedro Domingos proposes Tensor Logic (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect=
/0ac1e72b-4056-4aab-848f-4c60bc2258f6?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQ=
Jf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]), an ambitious new programming language de=
signed as the =E2=80=9Clanguage of AI=E2=80=9D that natively fuses neural a=
nd symbolic approaches. The motivation is that current tools are lacking: f=
rameworks like PyTorch/TF give us auto-differentiation on GPUs but bolt ont=
o Python (which has no built-in support for logical reasoning or knowledge)=
, while classic AI languages (Prolog, Lisp) handle symbols and logic but ca=
n=E2=80=99t scale or learn from data. Tensor Logic addresses this by making=
 the tensor equation the one core construct, since Domingos observes that l=
ogical inference rules are mathematically like tensor index summation (Eins=
tein summation). Everything else in AI can be reduced to that form. The pap=
er demonstrates how key paradigms - from transformers and neural nets to fo=
rmal logic proofs, kernel methods, and graphical models - can all be implem=
ented elegantly in Tensor Logic=E2=80=99s unified framework. Crucially, thi=
s opens up new possibilities like =E2=80=9Csound reasoning in embedding spa=
ce=E2=80=9D - combining neural scalability/learnability with the rigor of s=
ymbolic reasoning. Tensor Logic thus aims to be a foundation for AI going f=
orward, offering the transparency of symbols with the power of tensors, pot=
entially spurring broader adoption of AI by bridging the long-standing neur=
o-symbolic divide.

They introduce a theoretical framework showing that after pre-training, app=
lying RL enables models to solve tasks requiring long chain-of-thought with=
 far less data than next-token prediction alone. Essentially, </span><stron=
g>RL rewards the final outcome</strong><span> of a multi-step reasoning cha=
in, letting the model leverage longer test-time computation (longer answers=
) to learn the task. For example, in a toy parity task with mostly short ex=
amples, an RL-finetuned transformer generalizes correctly using long chains=
, whereas a purely next-token-trained one would need exponentially more dat=
a. They also confirm the effect on real models: RL finetuning LLaMA on mixt=
ure-of-experts math problems yields better generalization by exploiting lon=
ger reasoning steps.</span></p><div class=3D"captioned-image-container-stat=

">paper</a><span>)</span></strong><span>, an ambitious new programming lang=
uage designed as the =E2=80=9Clanguage of AI=E2=80=9D that natively fuses n=
eural and symbolic approaches. The motivation is that current tools are lac=
king: frameworks like PyTorch/TF give us auto-differentiation on GPUs but b=
olt onto Python (which has no built-in support for logical reasoning or kno=
wledge), while classic AI languages (Prolog, Lisp) handle symbols and logic=
 but can=E2=80=99t scale or learn from data. Tensor Logic addresses this by=
 making the </span><strong>tensor equation the one core construct</strong><=
span>, since Domingos observes that </span><em>logical inference rules are =
mathematically like tensor index summation (Einstein summation)</em><span>.=
 Everything else in AI can be reduced to that form. The paper demonstrates =
how key paradigms - from transformers and neural nets to formal logic proof=
s, kernel methods, and graphical models - can all be implemented elegantly =
in Tensor Logic=E2=80=99s unified framework. Crucially, this opens up new p=
ossibilities like </span><strong>=E2=80=9Csound reasoning in embedding spac=
e=E2=80=9D</strong><span> - combining neural scalability/learnability with =
the rigor of symbolic reasoning. Tensor Logic thus aims to be a foundation =
for AI going forward, offering the </span><strong>transparency of symbols w=
ith the power of tensors</strong><span>, potentially spurring broader adopt=
ion of AI by bridging the long-standing neuro-symbolic divide.</span></p><d=
