Dear Money-Maker, Mark here.=C2=A0

Look, I've seen more trading strategies fail than most people have
even tried.

After 20+ years making money in options - first on the CBOE floor,
then building Option Pit - I can smell BS from a mile away. And let me
tell you, 99% of what gets sold to retail traders is exactly that.

How many times have you bought into some "revolutionary" system that
looked great in the marketing but fell apart the moment you put real
money behind it?

Here's what I learned the hard way: most strategies are either
designed by people who've never traded real money, or they're so
complicated that they only work if you can sit in front of screens 12
hours a day.

That's exactly why we built the CRT approval process at Option Pit.
Any strategy I put my name behind has to pass three brutal tests:

Consistently profitable - not just on good days
Repeatable - works in bull markets, bear markets, sideways chop
Teachable - normal people can actually execute it

Most strategies fail the first test. Game Plan is the first one in
years that's aced all three.

WHEN A WALL STREET INSIDER ACTUALLY DELIVERS

Now, when Voz first started talking about "volume profile," I'll be
honest - I rolled my eyes. Another indicator? Really?

But here's the thing about Voz - she didn't learn this stuff from some
YouTube guru. She spent years getting taught by a top producer at a
major institutional firm. Real Wall Street. Real money. Real
techniques that retail traders never see.

What sold me wasn't the fancy charts or the technical analysis. It was
watching her track record: 91.94% win rate over 62 live trades.

Back on the floor, we used to say "SHOW ME THE MONEY, NOT THE THEORY."
Voz showed me the money.

And here's what really impressed me - she figured out how to package
institutional-level analysis into something you can trade with a few
minutes each morning. No PhD required.

THE SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY FITS YOUR LIFE

Here's exactly what happened today - and it shows you how simple this
really is:

This morning, Voz sent Game Plan members this message:

_"The path to the least resistance is down today. Put Zone: When SPY
has a clean break into 587.66 BTO the SPY May 30 586 Put. Your target
to sell is when SPY reaches 586.97"_

That's it. One simple instruction.

Members who followed it made serious money today:

_"GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. JUST MADE 17% ON TODAY'S GP. THANKS FOR THE
WIN VOZ."_ - Steve

_"THANKS VOZ $2300"_ - ponnezhan

_"2950. PLUS THE FRONT RUN 1650. TOTAL 4600.00 THANKS VOZ"_ - Scott
B=C2=A0

[FREP]

Here's the entire process:

MORNING: Check your email for the day's zones (takes 30 seconds)
SET ALERTS: Put them in your phone while you drink coffee
GO TO WORK: Live your actual life
GET NOTIFIED: Phone buzzes when SPY hits a zone
EXECUTE: Buy the option, set your exit
COLLECT: Take profits and move on

_"THE MOST PROFITABLE, EASY TO FOLLOW STRATEGY I HAVE EVER PAID SO
FAR. WAIT TO GET IN THE ZONE, AND SELL ONCE WE REACH THE END OF THE
ZONE, THAT SIMPLE. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE AMAZING PLAYS. SE=C3=91ORITA
VOZ YOU ROCK." _- David A

This is exactly what I wanted when I was building Option Pit -
strategies that work for people who have actual lives outside of
trading.

WHY THIS WORKS WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS

Look, most retail strategies are based on lagging indicators - stuff
that tells you what already happened. It's like driving by looking in
the rearview mirror.

But volume profile? That's different. That's tracking where the real
money - the institutional money - is actually trading. When someone
moves a billion dollars, they can't hide it. It leaves footprints in
the volume data.

Voz learned how to read those footprints from guys who were using this
to make millions. While everyone else is chasing moving averages and
RSI, you're following the actual smart money flow.

_"91% WIN RATE IS NOT FAKE- IT'S REAL, I TRADE IT EVERY DAY."_ - B
Mindy

Here's what clicked for me - this isn't some theoretical backtested
system. This is based on how institutions actually operate. And
institutions don't change their behavior just because some retail
trader figured out their pattern.

REAL PEOPLE, REAL RESULTS (FROM TODAY)

_"This is my first consistent profitable subscription. I am steadily
increasing my account and enjoying the process."_ - Miguel

You know what I love about testimonials like these? It's not some guy
claiming he made a million dollars in a month. It's real people making
steady, consistent money.

Even when members get nervous and exit early, they're still winning:

_"Got nervous & got out to early only got 39%"_ - archie

Think about that - this guy was disappointed with a 39% return! That's
what happens when you're used to winning with a system that actually
works.

_"The first time I met Voz and Mark in person I had been trading for 2
months. No Clue. 3 years later I'm buying IONQ calls at the bottom
today and selling at the top."_ - Greg

From complete beginner to calling major moves. That's what happens
when you have a real edge instead of just hoping for the best.

THE NUMBERS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER

91.94% win rate over 62 trades. Average returns of 59.50% per trade.

Put $1,000 on each of those trades? You'd have made $36,890 in
profits.

But here's what really matters to me - it's not just the winning
percentage. It's the consistency. Bull market, bear market, sideways
chop - the zones keep working because they're based on where real
money actually trades.

This isn't some once-in-a-lifetime hot streak. This is a systematic
edge that works because it's based on institutional behavior that's
been consistent for decades.

SEE HOW THE PROS ACTUALLY TRADE

Look, I could keep throwing numbers at you all day. But there's
something more powerful than anything I can write about.

Watching Voz break down her volume profile analysis in real-time.
Seeing her identify the exact zones where institutions accumulate
positions. Understanding why each setup has such a high probability of
success.

This isn't some marketing webinar full of hype and no substance. This
is a real demonstration of the exact techniques that Wall Street uses
to print money - except now it's packaged for people who don't have 12
hours a day to analyze charts.

The access to this is extremely limited. When institutional edges
become too widely known, they stop working.

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt;">But here's the t=

<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt;">Look, most retai=
l strategies are based on lagging indicators - stuff that tells you what al=
ready happened. It's like driving by looking in the rearview mirror.</span>=
</p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt;">But volume profi=
le? That's different. That's tracking where the real money - the institutio=
nal money - is actually trading. When someone moves a billion dollars, they=
 can't hide it. It leaves footprints in the volume data.</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt;">Voz learned how =
to read those footprints from guys who were using this to make millions. Wh=
ile everyone else is chasing moving averages and RSI, you're following the =
actual smart money flow.</span></p>

havior just because some retail trader figured out their pattern.</span></p=

really matters to me - it's not just the winning percentage. It's the consi=
