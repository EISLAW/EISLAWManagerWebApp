DAILY MEMO: US, IRAN TO REVIVE TALKS [3]
THE U.S. PRESIDENT, HOWEVER, IS SKEPTICAL ON THE NEED FOR MORE NEGOTIATIONS.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
DIPLOMATIC REVIVAL. U.S. and Iranian officials will hold their first talks since Israel's assault on Iran's nuclear facilities last month "in the next week or so," U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff
said [4]. President Donald Trump claimed that Tehran wanted a meeting [5], though Iranian officials have denied this [6]. Trump further said he saw little point in negotiating because the United
States had already “destroyed” Iran’s nuclear program. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would help Iran deplete its enriched uranium supplies [7] if Tehran
requested. He explained that Iran is now in talks on limiting its uranium enrichment, and that Moscow has made clear that it can process highly enriched uranium and return energy-grade uranium for use
in Iran's nuclear power plants.
IRANIAN DEFENSES. Iran has reportedly acquired Chinese-made HQ-9B surface-to-air missile systems [8] as part of its efforts to rebuild its air defenses following the conflict with Israel last month.
Tehran apparently paid for the systems with oil deliveries. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil.
ISRAEL'S STANCE. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed never to allow Palestinians sovereignty over their own security [9]. During a meeting with Trump at the White House, he said that
Palestinians deserved to govern themselves but that sovereign power would always remain in Israeli hands. Relatedly, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Qatar this week [10] to discuss a
ceasefire in Gaza.
RUSSIA-CHINA COLLABORATION. Russia has reportedly built one of its largest military drone factories [11] near the eastern city of Khabarovsk with the help of Chinese partners, despite Beijing’s
assertion that it does not supply military technologies for use in the Russia-Ukraine war. Private Russian firm Aero-HIT has, with support from the Russian government, expanded its production capacity
at the facility to 10,000 drones per month and aims to manufacture more advanced models. Documents obtained by Bloomberg indicate the firm has been collaborating with China's Autel Robotics to move
production of a Chinese-made drone model to the Russian facility. It has also received support from Chinese academic institutions and firms sanctioned by the United States.
MORE TARIFFS. The U.S. announced that it will impose 25-40 percent tariffs [12] on 14 countries, which were informed about the measure by letters addressed to their leaders. The announcement was made
ahead of the July 9 deadline by which duties on dozens of countries were set to go into effect following a temporary reprieve. Some of the targeted states are already promising to react. Kazakhstan,
which is facing a 25 percent charge on some of its exports to the U.S., said it was preparing an “official response.” [13]
EUROPEAN PREPARATIONS. Europe’s largest port, in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, has begun preparing for a potential conflict with Russia by reserving space for ships carrying military cargo, the CEO
of the Port of Rotterdam Authority said [14]. Authorities are building a container terminal at the port for the safe transportation of ammunition. It will also host amphibious landing exercises
several times a year.
NEW JET. China has commissioned the world’s first twin-seat fifth-generation fighter jet [15]. The latest version of the J-20 can accommodate a weapons systems officer alongside the pilot, allowing
for greater work sharing, especially on complicated missions. The jets are expected to act as controllers for unmanned wingman aircraft and could also be used as electronic attack aircraft and
airborne command posts.
RUSSIA AND AZERBAIJAN. The head of Russia’s Emergencies Ministry arrived in Baku [16] for a meeting with his Azerbaijani counterpart amid rising tensions between the two countries. Meanwhile, a
court in Baku ruled against releasing [17] the executive director and the editor-in-chief of the Azerbaijani arm of Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik – both of whom were detained as a
“preventative measure” following a raid on the agency’s offices.
NEW PARTNER. Kazakhstan participated for the first time [18] as a partner country in a BRICS summit, held this year in Brazil. The Kazakh foreign minister said it was a sign of his country’s
commitment to a fair and sustainable global order and to strengthening the role of middle powers in global decision-making.
STRENGTHENING TIES. Pakistani and Afghan officials held talks in Islamabad [19] on Tuesday, aimed at continuing to improve their bilateral relations. The meeting focused on trade, visas, security,
connectivity and repatriation of Afghan nationals.
