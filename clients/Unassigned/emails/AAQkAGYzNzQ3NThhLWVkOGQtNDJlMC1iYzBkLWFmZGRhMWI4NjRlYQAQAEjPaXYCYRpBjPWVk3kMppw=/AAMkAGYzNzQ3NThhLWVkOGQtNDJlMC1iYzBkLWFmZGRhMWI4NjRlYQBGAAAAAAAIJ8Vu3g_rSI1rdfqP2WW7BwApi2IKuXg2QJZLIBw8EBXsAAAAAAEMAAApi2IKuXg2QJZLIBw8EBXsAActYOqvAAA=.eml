Welcome, Watcher! This week, we're exploring three recent AI developments t=
hat are transforming how models reason, learn independently, and remember i=
nformation.
First, Llama-Nemotron tackles the challenge of making high-quality reasonin=
g accessible and efficient. By combining neural architecture search, knowle=
dge distillation, and curriculum-driven reinforcement learning, this open-s=
ource family of models delivers state-of-the-art reasoning performance with=
 dramatically improved inference speed. Their "detailed thinking on/off" to=
ggle lets users dynamically allocate compute resources only when deep reaso=
ning is needed, making advanced AI reasoning viable for real-world, cost-se=
nsitive deployments.
Next, Absolute Zero redefines how AI learns to think by completely eliminat=
ing the need for human-curated datasets. Through a clever self-play approac=
h, a single model invents its own coding puzzles across three complementary=
 reasoning types, then learns to solve them through trial and error. This z=
ero-data reinforcement learning paradigm matches or exceeds methods trained=
 on thousands of expert-labeled problems, pointing toward a future where AI=
 systems can autonomously improve their reasoning abilities without human s=
upervision.
Finally, Rethinking Memory in AI provides a much-needed comprehensive map o=
f how AI systems store, manage, and utilize information. By classifying mem=
ory into three types and six core operations, this work creates a unified f=
ramework for understanding everything from parametric memory in model weigh=
ts to contextual structured and unstructured memory. This taxonomy illumina=
tes emerging research areas like long-term personalized memory and safe for=
getting techniques, establishing a clear playbook for building systems that=
 can learn over time and adapt to users.
The connecting threads are clear: making advanced reasoning more accessible=
 and efficient, enabling models to improve themselves without human guidanc=
e, and establishing frameworks for how AI systems remember and process info=
rmation. Together, these advances are building toward more capable, efficie=
nt, and adaptable AI systems that can reason deeply while remaining practic=
al for real-world applications.

What problem does it solve? Large language models that =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=80=
=9D step by step (chain-of-thought reasoning) have set new benchmarks in ma=
th, coding, and scientific Q&A, but they=E2=80=99re massive, slow, and ofte=
n closed-source. This makes it hard for companies and researchers to deploy=
 them in cost=E2=80=90sensitive or custom settings, and you can=E2=80=99t e=
asily dial reasoning on or off to save compute on simpler queries. The pape=
r aims to bridge the gap between top-tier reasoning performance and real-wo=
rld inference efficiency in an open, enterprise-friendly package.
How does it solve the problem? They designed the Llama-Nemotron family in t=
hree sizes (8B, 49B, and 253B parameters) using a multi-stage pipeline:
Neural architecture search (NAS) and FFN fusion to build inference-optimize=
d transformer blocks.
Knowledge distillation and continued pretraining from Llama-3 teachers to r=
ecover accuracy.
Supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning traces plus a large=E2=80=
=90scale, curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage (GRPO) to push bey=
ond teacher performance.=20
They also introduced a =E2=80=9Cdetailed thinking on/off=E2=80=9D toggle at=
 inference time and open-sourced the models, post-training dataset, and cod=
e (NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, Megatron-LM).
What are the key findings? Their flagship LN-Ultra (253B) matches or exceed=
s DeepSeek-R1 and other state-of-the-art reasoning models on benchmarks lik=
e GPQA-Diamond, AIME-24/25, LiveCodeBench, and MATH500, while running 1.7x =
faster and using less memory on a single 8xH100 node. The mid- and small-si=
zed variants (49B =E2=80=9CSuper=E2=80=9D and 8B =E2=80=9CNano=E2=80=9D) al=
so deliver strong multi-step reasoning and instruction-following accuracy a=
t dramatically lower cost. Across all sizes, the dynamic reasoning toggle w=
orks reliably to switch between detailed chains of thought and concise chat=
 mode.
Why does it matter? By open-sourcing high-throughput, reasoning-capable mod=
els under a permissive NVIDIA license, the work lowers the barrier for ente=
rprises and academics to build and deploy custom intelligent agents. Effici=
ent inference design means deep thinking no longer requires massive GPU far=
ms, and the user-controlled reasoning switch lets you allocate compute only=
 when needed. Finally, releasing the full training dataset and code fosters=
 reproducibility and accelerates future advances in LLM research.

2. Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data
Watching:  Absolute Zero (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/f9765a02-af=
9a-406b-a8c3-3346fdd671e1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Modern methods for sharpening a language model=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D (reasoning) skills lean heavily on la=
rge, hand=E2=80=90made sets of example questions, answers and reasoning ste=
ps. Curating tens of thousands of these by hand is slow, costly and won=E2=
=80=99t scale - especially if future AIs become smarter than us. Even =E2=
=80=9Czero=E2=80=90shot=E2=80=9D reinforcement approaches still need human-=
written question=E2=80=93answer pairs. This paper asks: can we train a mode=
l to get better at reasoning without any external human data at all?
How does it solve the problem? They propose a new paradigm called Absolute =
Zero: a single model alternately invents its own coding puzzles and then so=
lves them, all in a Python environment that can automatically verify answer=
s. By framing three complementary puzzle types - deduction (predict the out=
put), abduction (infer the input), and induction (synthesize a program from=
 examples) - the model learns via reinforcement learning from simple, outco=
me=E2=80=90based rewards. Their Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) is one unified=
 LLM serving as both =E2=80=9Cteacher=E2=80=9D (task proposer) and =E2=80=
=9Cstudent=E2=80=9D (solver), updated end-to-end with a tailored RL algorit=
hm.
What are the key findings? Remarkably, AZR - trained with zero human-curate=
d examples - matches or beats state-of-the-art =E2=80=9Czero=E2=80=9D model=
s that used tens of thousands of expert-labeled problems. On coding benchma=
rks like HumanEval+ and MBPP+ and on math tests (AIME, AMC, OlympiadBench),=
 AZR sets new records. It generalizes better across domains (code=E2=86=92m=
ath), scales its gains from 3B to 14B parameters, and even shows emergent b=
ehaviors like interleaved planning (=E2=80=9Ccomments as scratch-pads=E2=80=
=9D).
Why does it matter? By eliminating the need for any external dataset, this =
work removes a major bottleneck in reasoning=E2=80=90focused fine-tuning. I=
t points to a future where AI agents can autonomously invent challenges, le=
arn from them, and continually improve - potentially attaining superhuman r=
easoning - without costly human supervision. This self-play-driven approach=
 could redefine how we build scalable, adaptive, and ever-smarter AI, thoug=
h it also highlights the need for careful safety oversight as models learn =
on their own.
3. Rethinking Memory in AI: Taxonomy, Operations, Topics, and Future Direct=
ions
Watching: AI Memory (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/80591b0b-1ca6-47=

xQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code [ https://substack.com/redirect/4f94c197-f3ea-42be-a63=

MRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? AI systems - especially those built on big lang=
uage models - rely on different kinds of =E2=80=9Cmemory=E2=80=9D (like fac=
ts baked into their weights or chunks of past text), but researchers lack a=
 clear, unified map of how that memory is stored, managed, and used. Existi=
ng surveys often look at only one piece (say, long-context prompts or perso=
nalization) and miss the basic =E2=80=9Catomic=E2=80=9D operations - writin=
g new facts, indexing them, updating or erasing old ones, pulling them back=
 out, or squashing information to fit a limited space.
How does it solve the problem? They drew up a simple but comprehensive blue=
print: split AI memory into three types - parametric (inside the model=E2=
=80=99s weights), contextual structured (things like tables and graphs), an=
d contextual unstructured (raw text or embeddings) - and define six core op=
erations (consolidation, indexing, updating, forgetting, retrieval, compres=
sion). Then they scanned over 30,000 top-conference papers, used a time-adj=
usted citation score to pick the most influential work, and systematically =
mapped methods, datasets, and tools onto this taxonomy.
What are the key findings? Four major research themes emerge: (1) long-term=
 memory for bots that can remember you across many chats, (2) long-context =
memory to handle really big chunks of text without dropping bits in the mid=
dle, (3) parametric memory editing and unlearning to tweak or erase facts i=
nside a model=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cbrain,=E2=80=9D and (4) multi-source memor=
y that merges text, tables, images, and more. The survey also inventories p=
opular benchmarks (e.g., LongBench, LoCoMo), frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIn=
dex), and memory-as-a-service tools (Mem0, Zep), while highlighting gaps li=
ke time-aware (=E2=80=9Cspatio-temporal=E2=80=9D) memory and safe forgettin=
g.
Why does it matter? Their work provides a clear, operation-by-operation pla=
ybook for anyone building or studying AI memory systems - helping developer=
s pick the right tools, guiding researchers to open challenges, and ultimat=
ely enabling service-bots and agents that learn over time, adapt to you, an=
d remove outdated or harmful information safely.

aking high-quality reasoning accessible and efficient. By combining neural =
architecture search, knowledge distillation, and curriculum-driven reinforc=
ement learning, this open-source family of models delivers state-of-the-art=
 reasoning performance with dramatically improved inference speed. Their &q=
uot;detailed thinking on/off&quot; toggle lets users dynamically allocate c=
ompute resources only when deep reasoning is needed, making advanced AI rea=
soning viable for real-world, cost-sensitive deployments.</span></p><p styl=

 AI learns to think by completely eliminating the need for human-curated da=
tasets. Through a clever self-play approach, a single model invents its own=
 coding puzzles across three complementary reasoning types, then learns to =
solve them through trial and error. This zero-data reinforcement learning p=
aradigm matches or exceeds methods trained on thousands of expert-labeled p=
roblems, pointing toward a future where AI systems can autonomously improve=
 their reasoning abilities without human supervision.</span></p><p style=3D=

ides a much-needed comprehensive map of how AI systems store, manage, and u=
tilize information. By classifying memory into three types and six core ope=
rations, this work creates a unified framework for understanding everything=
 from parametric memory in model weights to contextual structured and unstr=
uctured memory. This taxonomy illuminates emerging research areas like long=
-term personalized memory and safe forgetting techniques, establishing a cl=
ear playbook for building systems that can learn over time and adapt to use=
rs.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

solve the problem? </strong><span>They propose a new paradigm called Absolu=
te Zero: a single model alternately invents its own coding puzzles and then=
 solves them, all in a Python environment that can automatically verify ans=
wers. By framing three complementary puzzle types - deduction (predict the =
output), abduction (infer the input), and induction (synthesize a program f=
rom examples) - the model learns via reinforcement learning from simple, ou=
tcome=E2=80=90based rewards. Their Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) is one unif=
ied LLM serving as both =E2=80=9Cteacher=E2=80=9D (task proposer) and =E2=
=80=9Cstudent=E2=80=9D (solver), updated end-to-end with a tailored RL algo=

d MBPP+ and on math tests (AIME, AMC, OlympiadBench), AZR sets new records.=
 It generalizes better across domains (code=E2=86=92math), scales its gains=
 from 3B to 14B parameters, and even shows emergent behaviors like interlea=
ved planning (=E2=80=9Ccomments as scratch-pads=E2=80=9D).</span></p><p sty=

=E2=80=90focused fine-tuning. It points to a future where AI agents can aut=
onomously invent challenges, learn from them, and continually improve - pot=

 that memory is stored, managed, and used. Existing surveys often look at o=
nly one piece (say, long-context prompts or personalization) and miss the b=
