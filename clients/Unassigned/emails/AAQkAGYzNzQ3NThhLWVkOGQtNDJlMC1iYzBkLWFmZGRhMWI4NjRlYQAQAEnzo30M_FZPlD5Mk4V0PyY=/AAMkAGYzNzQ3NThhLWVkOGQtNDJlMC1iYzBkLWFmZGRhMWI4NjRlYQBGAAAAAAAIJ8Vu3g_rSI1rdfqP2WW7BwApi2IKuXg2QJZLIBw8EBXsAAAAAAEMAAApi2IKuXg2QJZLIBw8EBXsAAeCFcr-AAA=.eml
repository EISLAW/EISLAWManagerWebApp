I think I see taste as one of the great differentiators of our age.
I think most of the writing on it boils down to: =E2=80=9Chey it=E2=80=99s =
good to have taste!"
That=E2=80=99s not helpful, and I wanted to write something more useful tha=
t gets at why I think taste matters, how you cultivate taste at various poi=
nts in your career, and how taste evolves as we work with smarter and smart=
er agents.
There=E2=80=99s a bit in here too on what it means to be human, teaching ou=
r kids about taste, and the evolving nature of work in the age of AI. Enjoy=
!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
I've been thinking about taste lately, and not in the way you'd expect. Not=
 the kind where someone knows which fork to use at dinner or can pronounce =
the wine correctly. I mean the gut feeling you get when something's off in =
a piece of work, even when you can't quite articulate why. That instinct th=
at makes you say "this could be better" without necessarily knowing how to =
fix it yet.
Here's what I've noticed: as AI gets better at producing the mechanics of w=
ork=E2=80=94the spreadsheets, the documents, the code=E2=80=94taste becomes=
 our differentiator. It's what's left when the grunt work disappears. And I=
 mean really disappears. When Claude can build a working financial model in=
 one shot, when GPT-5 Pro can reason through complex problems for minutes a=
t a time, what exactly is our job?
The answer isn't comfortable, but it's true: our job is to know when the ou=
tput isn't quite right. To recognize that hollow feeling in AI-generated wo=
rk, that sense that something's missing even when all the pieces are techni=
cally correct. This isn't about being a snob. It's about having accumulated=
 enough experience in a particular domain that you develop strong opinions =
about what good looks like.
Think about it this way. We're all flexible tool users=E2=80=94that's maybe=
 the best definition of humanity I've encountered. We adapt to new tools co=
nstantly. But right now, we're adapting to tools that are gaining intellige=
nce on a timeline of months, not decades. GPT-5 Pro genuinely outthinks me =
in specific domains. I'm not embarrassed to admit that. The model can hold =
more context, reason through more permutations, and generate more options t=
han I can. But I still know when its output feels wrong for the situation.
This creates an interesting dynamic. We're simultaneously dealing with tool=
s that are smarter than us in some ways while being utterly dependent on us=
 for direction. They need our taste to guide them. Without it, they produce=
 technically correct but contextually hollow work. They miss the nuances th=
at come from living in the world, from having skin in the game, from unders=
tanding consequences beyond the immediate problem.
Where taste comes from
The thing about taste is that it's embodied. AI doesn't live through decade=
s of awkward teenage years, doesn't sit through endless meetings where the =
real decision happened in the hallway afterward, doesn't learn to read when=
 someone's "yes" actually means "I'll think about it." These models are bri=
lliant, but they're disembodied intelligence. They've never had to metaboli=
ze failure, never felt the particular tension in a room when a project is a=
bout to go sideways, never developed that sixth sense for when the numbers =
look right but something's still wrong.
This embodied experience creates a kind of pattern recognition that transce=
nds pure intelligence. You know how sometimes you can tell a meeting is goi=
ng badly even though everyone's saying the right words? That's embodied tas=
te. You've sat through enough meetings to recognize the subtle shift in ene=
rgy, the way people start checking their phones, the forced enthusiasm that=
 means we're all just going through the motions. An AI can read the transcr=
ipt perfectly and miss everything that actually happened.
I think about this as the compost pile of the mind. All your experiences=E2=
=80=94the failures, the successes, the near-misses=E2=80=94decompose slowly=
 in your brain, mixing together, breaking down into something richer. When =
you need to make a judgment call, you're not consciously reviewing every si=
milar situation you've encountered. You're drawing on this composted mixtur=
e that has become instinct. The AI doesn't have a compost pile. It has trai=
ning data, but that's not the same thing as lived experience slowly decompo=
sing into wisdom.
Here's what's interesting though: you don't need decades to develop taste. =
I've seen people just starting their careers who have incredible taste in s=
pecific domains because they're obsessed. They've gone deep on one particul=
ar corner of the world, and they know it better than people with thirty yea=
rs of general experience. They have taste not because they've been around f=
orever, but because they care intensely about getting this one thing right.=
 That caring, that obsession, fast-tracks the development of taste in ways =
that time alone never could.
This matters because it means taste isn't just for gray hairs reflecting on=
 long careers. If you're twenty-two and you've spent the last three years o=
bsessing over video game mechanics or TikTok aesthetics or supply chain opt=
imization, you have taste in that domain. Real taste. The kind that can spo=
t what's wrong with an AI's output even when the AI is technically smarter =
than you.
Sidebar: For those starting their careers
If you're early in your career, here's the counterintuitive truth: you migh=
t have an advantage in developing AI-era taste. You don't have decades of m=
uscle memory around outdated workflows. You're not attached to the way thin=
gs used to be done.
Pick a corner of the world and go deep. Really deep. It doesn't matter if i=
t's "professional" or not. Maybe you know everything about a particular gam=
e's mechanics, or you've spent years understanding a specific online commun=
ity, or you're obsessed with a narrow technical problem. That obsession cre=
ates taste faster than broad experience ever could.
When you work with AI, be demanding. Don't accept the first output just bec=
ause it seems smarter than what you could produce. You know your corner bet=
ter than any model. Push back. Say "this part doesn't feel right" even if y=
ou can't fully articulate why. Your fresh eyes combined with deep domain kn=
owledge is a powerful combination.
The key is to position yourself as the taste layer for your specific domain=
=2E You're not competing on years of ex=
perience. You're competing on depth of=
 understanding in areas that matter right now. That's a recipe for rapid ca=
reer growth in an AI world.
The practical mechanics of taste
So what does exercising taste actually look like in practice? It's not abst=
ract judgment from on high. It's specific, detailed feedback. It's telling =
Claude, "Your phrasing is overdramatic here." It's catching that "two of th=
ese numbers are made up, the other sixteen are not." It's saying, "Please t=
ell me when you need more information instead of guessing." These aren't ph=
ilosophical critiques. They're practical interventions based on knowing wha=
t good looks like.
I see people respond to AI in two ways, and both are mistakes. Either they =
become overly deferential=E2=80=94the model said it, so it must be right=E2=
=80=94or they reject it entirely at the first error. What we need instead i=
s the confidence to engage with these models as collaborators while maintai=
ning our editorial authority. To say "I see where you got that, and it's te=
chnically correct, but it misses something important about this situation."
The new dynamic with something like GPT-5 Pro is particularly interesting. =
It's becoming more like consulting an oracle than having a chat. You prepar=
e your prompt carefully, you wait minutes for the response, and then you ha=
ve to interpret what comes back. This isn't instant messaging anymore. It's=
 something more ritualistic, more considered. And that changes how taste op=
erates. You're not just editing on the fly; you're interpreting sacred text=
s that took significant compute to generate.
But here's the key: even when the oracle is smarter than you in raw process=
ing power, you still need taste to evaluate its pronouncements. I've looked=
 at GPT-5 Pro outputs and thought, "This is brilliant strategic analysis gi=
ven what I told you, but what I'm learning is that I didn't give you the co=
ntext you needed." That's taste in action=E2=80=94not rejecting the intelli=
gence of the response, but recognizing that intelligence without context is=
 hollow.
The tactical application of taste is surprisingly specific. It's not enough=
 to say "make it better." You need to articulate what better means in this =
context. Does it mean more concrete examples? Less corporate speak? More aw=
areness of political dynamics? The clearer you can be about what your taste=
 is detecting, the better you can guide these systems. And they need guidin=
g. They're brilliant students who've never left the library.
The anxiety of shifting value
Let's talk about why this shift creates such profound anxiety. People built=
 entire careers on skills that are suddenly commoditized. That technical pr=
oject manager who could wrangle 200 stakeholders, keep everyone aligned, an=
d ship on time? AI can now manage complex dependencies, generate status upd=
ates, and identify blockers. The knowledge workers who derived their value =
from typing fast and processing information? ChatGPT types faster and proce=
sses more.
This isn't just about job security. It's about identity. If you've spent tw=
enty years becoming excellent at something, and suddenly a model can do it =
in seconds, what are you? Who are you? The answer isn't comfortable: you're=
 someone whose value now lies in judgment rather than execution, in knowing=
 what to do rather than doing it, in recognizing quality rather than produc=
ing quantity.
The model makers understand this shift, and they're playing a different gam=
e than you might realize. They're not just building tools; they're trying t=
o capture your work time the way Facebook captured your social time and Tik=
Tok captured your attention. Claude wants you thinking in Claude, generatin=
g artifacts in Claude, collaborating in Claude. OpenAI wants you in ChatGPT=
=2E They're building ecosystems designe=
d to hold your attention and, more imp=
ortantly, to hold your work process.
This isn't necessarily sinister, but it's important to recognize. These com=
panies are betting that if they can capture enough of your workflow, they b=
ecome indispensable. And the more of your work happens inside their systems=
, the more your taste becomes the only thing you're contributing. You becom=
e the editor-in-chief of AI output, the quality control for artificial inte=
lligence, the human taste layer on top of machine generation.
The stress comes from how fast this is happening. Models are gaining intell=
igence on a timeline of months. Every time you figure out how to work with =
one level of capability, a new model drops that changes the game. It's exha=
usting. It's like learning to dance while the music keeps changing tempo.
Sidebar: For senior professionals
If you're deep into your career, this shift might feel like betrayal. You s=
pent decades accumulating expertise, and now a model can replicate much of =
it instantly. But here's what the model can't replicate: your understanding=
 of consequences.
You've seen projects fail for non-obvious reasons. You know why that techni=
cally perfect solution crashed and burned when it hit organizational realit=
y. You understand the unwritten rules, the political dynamics, the human fa=
ctors that never make it into documentation. That's irreplaceable.
Your task isn't to compete with AI on execution=E2=80=94you'll lose. Your t=
ask is to become the wisdom layer. To know which problems are worth solving=
, which stakeholders actually matter, which metrics are gamed and which ref=
lect reality. You're not the project manager who herds 200 stakeholders any=
more; you're the person who knows which five stakeholders actually make the=
 decisions.
The transition is this: stop defining yourself by what you can produce and =
start defining yourself by what you can prevent, what you can direct, what =
you can recognize as important versus urgent. Your taste, built over decade=
s, is about understanding second and third-order effects that no model can =
anticipate because they've never lived through the consequences.
Transform your experience into editorial judgment. Become the person who ca=
n look at an AI's technically perfect project plan and say, "This will fail=
 in week three because you don't understand how procurement actually works =
here." That knowledge=E2=80=94embodied, contextual, consequence-aware=E2=80=
=94is your competitive advantage.
The evolution and cultivation of taste
Here's something crucial: taste isn't fixed. What I cared about in 2000 is =
unrecognizable from what matters to me now. The skills I thought were perma=
nent turned out to be temporary. The expertise I accumulated in specific to=
ols or platforms became irrelevant when those platforms died or evolved. Bu=
t the meta-skill=E2=80=94the ability to develop taste in new domains=E2=80=
=94that persists.
This is liberating once you understand it. You're not trying to defend a fi=
xed position. You're not clinging to expertise that's being eroded. You're =
cultivating the ability to develop taste in whatever domain becomes importa=
nt. It's like learning to learn, but more specific: learning to develop str=
ong opinions based on accumulated experience, even when the domain keeps sh=
ifting.
The cultivation of taste is an active process. You can accelerate it. Pay a=
ttention to when something feels off, even if you can't articulate why. Not=
ice patterns in what works and what doesn't. Build your own compost pile of=
 experiences. And most importantly, be willing to have opinions. Not uninfo=
rmed opinions, but opinions based on pattern recognition that you might not=
 be able to fully explain.
Fantasy football players do this naturally. They develop strong opinions ab=
out draft order and player selection based on pattern recognition from seas=
ons of play. They have taste in that domain. The same person might have no =
taste in wine or art, but they can tell you exactly why taking that running=
 back in the third round is a mistake. That's domain-specific taste, and it=
's valuable.
The trick is recognizing that professional taste works the same way. You de=
velop it through repetition, through caring about outcomes, through being w=
illing to say "this isn't good enough" and then figuring out why. And incre=
asingly, you develop it through interaction with AI=E2=80=94through hundred=
s of conversations where you learn to recognize what the model does well an=
d where it falls short.
Sidebar: Teaching kids about AI and taste
If you're a parent or teacher, you're facing a unique challenge: preparing =
kids for a world where AI can do much of what we traditionally taught them =
to do. Here's the shift: stop emphasizing execution and start emphasizing j=
udgment.
When kids use AI for homework, don't just check if they got the right answe=
r. Ask them: "Does this feel right to you? What would you change? What's mi=
ssing?" Teach them to be editors, not just producers. Help them develop the=
 confidence to push back on AI outputs, to say "this doesn't sound like me"=
 or "this misses the point."
Encourage obsessions. If your kid is deeply into Minecraft redstone circuit=
s or K-pop choreography or ancient Egypt, that's them developing taste. The=
y're learning to distinguish good from great in a specific domain. That ski=
ll=E2=80=94the ability to develop strong opinions through deep engagement=
=E2=80=94transfers to whatever they'll need to do professionally.
Most importantly, teach them that working with AI isn't cheating; it's coll=
aboration. But collaboration requires maintaining your own standards, your =
own sense of what's good. Help them understand that the human role isn't to=
 compete with AI on computation but to provide the wisdom about what comput=
ations matter.
The goal isn't to shield kids from AI or to make them dependent on it. It's=
 to help them develop the taste to use it well=E2=80=94to know when it's he=
lping and when it's leading them astray, to maintain their own voice and st=
andards even when a model can generate infinite alternatives.
Working with intelligence that surpasses your own
This brings us to the weirdest part of our current moment: we're collaborat=
ing with intelligence that surpasses our own in specific dimensions. GPT-5 =
Pro can hold more context than me, reason through more permutations, genera=
te more options. In certain types of problems, it's simply smarter than I a=
m. This is new for humanity. We've never had to manage intelligence that ex=
ceeds our own.
But here's what I've learned: superior intelligence without taste is like a=
 powerful engine without a steering wheel. The model can generate brilliant=
 solutions to the wrong problems. It can produce technically perfect work t=
hat's politically impossible. It can optimize for metrics that don't actual=
ly matter. And it doesn't know it's doing any of these things because it la=
cks the embodied experience to recognize the difference.
This is why taste matters more as models get smarter, not less. When GPT-6 =
arrives=E2=80=94and it will=E2=80=94it won't eliminate the need for human j=
udgment. It will amplify it. The smarter these systems get, the more import=
ant it becomes to have someone who can say, "Yes, that's brilliant, but it'=
s solving the wrong problem." Or "That's technically perfect, but it will n=
ever work here because you don't understand the politics."
I think of it as being the editor of a brilliant but alien intelligence. Th=
e AI is the brilliant writer who's never left their room. They've read ever=
ything, they can connect ideas in ways you never could, they can generate o=
ptions faster than you can read them. But they don't know what it's like to=
 present to a hostile board, to navigate office politics, to recognize when=
 a technically correct solution will create more problems than it solves.
Your taste=E2=80=94your embodied, experienced, composted understanding of h=
ow the world actually works=E2=80=94becomes the bridge between artificial i=
ntelligence and useful outcomes. You're not competing with the model. You'r=
e providing what it cannot: the wisdom that comes from consequences, from s=
kin in the game, from having been wrong before and learned from it.
The new shape of work
We're moving into a world where insisting on quality, on usefulness, on con=
textual appropriateness becomes the job itself. Where having strong opinion=
s rooted in experience becomes more valuable than the ability to execute ta=
sks. Where taste=E2=80=94that ineffable sense of what's right and what's no=
t=E2=80=94becomes the skill that matters most.
This changes everything about how we think about work. The old model was: l=
earn skills, execute tasks, produce output. The new model is: develop taste=
, guide intelligence, ensure quality. It's a shift from being the person wh=
o does the work to being the person who knows what work should be done and =
whether it's good enough.
Some people find this depressing. They liked being the person who could exe=
cute, who could produce, who could make things happen through sheer effort.=
 But I find it liberating. We're being freed from the mechanical parts of k=
nowledge work to focus on what humans have always been best at: making judg=
ments based on incomplete information, understanding context and consequenc=
es, knowing when something feels off even if we can't fully explain why.
The practical reality is that we're all going to become editors. Not in the=
 narrow sense of fixing grammar, but in the broader sense of knowing what's=
 good, what's useful, what's appropriate for the situation. We're going to =
spend less time generating first drafts and more time recognizing when a dr=
aft serves its purpose. Less time creating spreadsheets and more time knowi=
ng which numbers actually matter.
So cultivate your taste. Trust your gut when something feels off. Don't be =
afraid to push back on technically correct but contextually wrong outputs. =
Be specific in your feedback=E2=80=94not "make it better" but "this section=
 is too abstract" or "you're missing the political dynamics here." And reme=
mber that being a flexible tool user means adapting not just to new tools, =
but to new ways of creating value with those tools.
The models will keep getting smarter. Make sure your taste keeps getting sh=
arper. Because in the end, that's what remains uniquely human: the ability =
to know what matters, what works, and what's worth doing in the first place=
=2E A surprising amount of the rest is becoming=E2=80=A6just computation.

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">I've been thinking about taste lately, and not in the way you'd expect=
. Not the kind where someone knows which fork to use at dinner or can prono=
unce the wine correctly. I mean the gut feeling you get when something's of=
f in a piece of work, even when you can't quite articulate why. That instin=
ct that makes you say &quot;this could be better&quot; without necessarily =
knowing how to fix it yet.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's what I've noticed: as AI =
gets better at producing the mechanics of work=E2=80=94the spreadsheets, th=
e documents, the code=E2=80=94taste becomes our differentiator. It's what's=
 left when the grunt work disappears. And I mean really disappears. When Cl=
aude can build a working financial model in one shot, when GPT-5 Pro can re=
ason through complex problems for minutes at a time, what exactly is our jo=
b?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">The answer isn't comfortable, but it's true: our job is =
to know when the output isn't quite right. To recognize that hollow feeling=
 in AI-generated work, that sense that something's missing even when all th=
e pieces are technically correct. This isn't about being a snob. It's about=
 having accumulated enough experience in a particular domain that you devel=
op strong opinions about what good looks like.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think about =
it this way. We're all flexible tool users=E2=80=94that's maybe the best de=
finition of humanity I've encountered. We adapt to new tools constantly. Bu=
t right now, we're adapting to tools that are gaining intelligence on a tim=
eline of months, not decades. GPT-5 Pro genuinely outthinks me in specific =
domains. I'm not embarrassed to admit that. The model can hold more context=
, reason through more permutations, and generate more options than I can. B=
ut I still know when its output feels wrong for the situation.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">This creates an interesting dynamic. We're simultaneously dealing with=
 tools that are smarter than us in some ways while being utterly dependent =
on us for direction. They need our taste to guide them. Without it, they pr=
oduce technically correct but contextually hollow work. They miss the nuanc=
es that come from living in the world, from having skin in the game, from u=
nderstanding consequences beyond the immediate problem.</p><h2 class=3D"hea=

here taste comes from</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The thing about taste is that it's e=
mbodied. AI doesn't live through decades of awkward teenage years, doesn't =
sit through endless meetings where the real decision happened in the hallwa=
y afterward, doesn't learn to read when someone's &quot;yes&quot; actually =
means &quot;I'll think about it.&quot; These models are brilliant, but they=
're disembodied intelligence. They've never had to metabolize failure, neve=
r felt the particular tension in a room when a project is about to go sidew=
ays, never developed that sixth sense for when the numbers look right but s=
omething's still wrong.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This embodied experience creates a =
kind of pattern recognition that transcends pure intelligence. You know how=
 sometimes you can tell a meeting is going badly even though everyone's say=
ing the right words? That's embodied taste. You've sat through enough meeti=
ngs to recognize the subtle shift in energy, the way people start checking =
their phones, the forced enthusiasm that means we're all just going through=
 the motions. An AI can read the transcript perfectly and miss everything t=
hat actually happened.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I think about this as the compost pi=
le of the mind. All your experiences=E2=80=94the failures, the successes, t=
he near-misses=E2=80=94decompose slowly in your brain, mixing together, bre=
aking down into something richer. When you need to make a judgment call, yo=
u're not consciously reviewing every similar situation you've encountered. =
You're drawing on this composted mixture that has become instinct. The AI d=
oesn't have a compost pile. It has training data, but that's not the same t=
hing as lived experience slowly decomposing into wisdom.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">He=
re's what's interesting though: you don't need decades to develop taste. I'=
ve seen people just starting their careers who have incredible taste in spe=
cific domains because they're obsessed. They've gone deep on one particular=
 corner of the world, and they know it better than people with thirty years=
 of general experience. They have taste not because they've been around for=
ever, but because they care intensely about getting this one thing right. T=
hat caring, that obsession, fast-tracks the development of taste in ways th=
at time alone never could.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This matters because it means ta=
ste isn't just for gray hairs reflecting on long careers. If you're twenty-=
two and you've spent the last three years obsessing over video game mechani=
cs or TikTok aesthetics or supply chain optimization, you have taste in tha=
t domain. Real taste. The kind that can spot what's wrong with an AI's outp=
ut even when the AI is technically smarter than you.</p><div style=3D"font-=

y in your career, here's the counterintuitive truth: you might have an adva=
ntage in developing AI-era taste. You don't have decades of muscle memory a=
round outdated workflows. You're not attached to the way things used to be =
done.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">Pick a corner of the world and go deep. Really deep. =
It doesn't matter if it's &quot;professional&quot; or not. Maybe you know e=
verything about a particular game's mechanics, or you've spent years unders=
tanding a specific online community, or you're obsessed with a narrow techn=
ical problem. That obsession creates taste faster than broad experience eve=
r could.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When you work with AI, be demanding. Don't accept =
the first output just because it seems smarter than what you could produce.=
 You know your corner better than any model. Push back. Say &quot;this part=
 doesn't feel right&quot; even if you can't fully articulate why. Your fres=
h eyes combined with deep domain knowledge is a powerful combination.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

ific domain. You're not competing on years of experience. You're competing =
on depth of understanding in areas that matter right now. That's a recipe f=
or rapid career growth in an AI world.</p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;lin=

 taste</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">So what does exercising taste actually look like in=
 practice? It's not abstract judgment from on high. It's specific, detailed=
 feedback. It's telling Claude, &quot;Your phrasing is overdramatic here.&q=
uot; It's catching that &quot;two of these numbers are made up, the other s=
ixteen are not.&quot; It's saying, &quot;Please tell me when you need more =
information instead of guessing.&quot; These aren't philosophical critiques=
. They're practical interventions based on knowing what good looks like.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">I see people respond to AI in two ways, and both are mistakes=
. Either they become overly deferential=E2=80=94the model said it, so it mu=
st be right=E2=80=94or they reject it entirely at the first error. What we =
need instead is the confidence to engage with these models as collaborators=
 while maintaining our editorial authority. To say &quot;I see where you go=
t that, and it's technically correct, but it misses something important abo=
ut this situation.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The new dynamic with something lik=
e GPT-5 Pro is particularly interesting. It's becoming more like consulting=
 an oracle than having a chat. You prepare your prompt carefully, you wait =
minutes for the response, and then you have to interpret what comes back. T=
his isn't instant messaging anymore. It's something more ritualistic, more =
considered. And that changes how taste operates. You're not just editing on=
 the fly; you're interpreting sacred texts that took significant compute to=
 generate.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's the key: even when the oracle is smar=
ter than you in raw processing power, you still need taste to evaluate its =
pronouncements. I've looked at GPT-5 Pro outputs and thought, &quot;This is=
 brilliant strategic analysis given what I told you, but what I'm learning =
is that I didn't give you the context you needed.&quot; That's taste in act=
ion=E2=80=94not rejecting the intelligence of the response, but recognizing=
 that intelligence without context is hollow.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The tactical =
application of taste is surprisingly specific. It's not enough to say &quot=
;make it better.&quot; You need to articulate what better means in this con=
text. Does it mean more concrete examples? Less corporate speak? More aware=
ness of political dynamics? The clearer you can be about what your taste is=
 detecting, the better you can guide these systems. And they need guiding. =
They're brilliant students who've never left the library.</p><h2 class=3D"h=

hift creates such profound anxiety. People built entire careers on skills t=
hat are suddenly commoditized. That technical project manager who could wra=
ngle 200 stakeholders, keep everyone aligned, and ship on time? AI can now =
manage complex dependencies, generate status updates, and identify blockers=
. The knowledge workers who derived their value from typing fast and proces=
sing information? ChatGPT types faster and processes more.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
This isn't just about job security. It's about identity. If you've spent tw=
enty years becoming excellent at something, and suddenly a model can do it =
in seconds, what are you? Who are you? The answer isn't comfortable: you're=
 someone whose value now lies in judgment rather than execution, in knowing=
 what to do rather than doing it, in recognizing quality rather than produc=
ing quantity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The model makers understand this shift, and t=
hey're playing a different game than you might realize. They're not just bu=
ilding tools; they're trying to capture your work time the way Facebook cap=
tured your social time and TikTok captured your attention. Claude wants you=
 thinking in Claude, generating artifacts in Claude, collaborating in Claud=

yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">This isn't necessarily sinister, but it's important to recognize. T=
hese companies are betting that if they can capture enough of your workflow=
, they become indispensable. And the more of your work happens inside their=
 systems, the more your taste becomes the only thing you're contributing. Y=

 work with one level of capability, a new model drops that changes the game=

te isn't fixed. What I cared about in 2000 is unrecognizable from what matt=
ers to me now. The skills I thought were permanent turned out to be tempora=
ry. The expertise I accumulated in specific tools or platforms became irrel=
evant when those platforms died or evolved. But the meta-skill=E2=80=94the =
ability to develop taste in new domains=E2=80=94that persists.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

 a fixed position. You're not clinging to expertise that's being eroded. Yo=
u're cultivating the ability to develop taste in whatever domain becomes im=
portant. It's like learning to learn, but more specific: learning to develo=

ps shifting.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The cultivation of taste is an active process.=
 You can accelerate it. Pay attention to when something feels off, even if =
you can't articulate why. Notice patterns in what works and what doesn't. B=
uild your own compost pile of experiences. And most importantly, be willing=
 to have opinions. Not uninformed opinions, but opinions based on pattern r=
ecognition that you might not be able to fully explain.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Fan=
tasy football players do this naturally. They develop strong opinions about=
 draft order and player selection based on pattern recognition from seasons=
 of play. They have taste in that domain. The same person might have no tas=

 outcomes, through being willing to say &quot;this isn't good enough&quot; =

tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">We're moving into a world where insisting on quality, on usefulnes=
s, on contextual appropriateness becomes the job itself. Where having stron=
g opinions rooted in experience becomes more valuable than the ability to e=
xecute tasks. Where taste=E2=80=94that ineffable sense of what's right and =
what's not=E2=80=94becomes the skill that matters most.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Thi=
s changes everything about how we think about work. The old model was: lear=
n skills, execute tasks, produce output. The new model is: develop taste, g=
uide intelligence, ensure quality. It's a shift from being the person who d=
oes the work to being the person who knows what work should be done and whe=
ther it's good enough.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Some people find this depressing. Th=
ey liked being the person who could execute, who could produce, who could m=
ake things happen through sheer effort. But I find it liberating. We're bei=
ng freed from the mechanical parts of knowledge work to focus on what human=
s have always been best at: making judgments based on incomplete informatio=
n, understanding context and consequences, knowing when something feels off=
 even if we can't fully explain why.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The practical reality =
is that we're all going to become editors. Not in the narrow sense of fixin=
g grammar, but in the broader sense of knowing what's good, what's useful, =
what's appropriate for the situation. We're going to spend less time genera=
ting first drafts and more time recognizing when a draft serves its purpose=
. Less time creating spreadsheets and more time knowing which numbers actua=
lly matter.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So cultivate your taste. Trust your gut when so=
mething feels off. Don't be afraid to push back on technically correct but =
contextually wrong outputs. Be specific in your feedback=E2=80=94not &quot;=
make it better&quot; but &quot;this section is too abstract&quot; or &quot;=
you're missing the political dynamics here.&quot; And remember that being a=
 flexible tool user means adapting not just to new tools, but to new ways o=
f creating value with those tools.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The models will keep get=
ting smarter. Make sure your taste keeps getting sharper. Because in the en=
d, that's what remains uniquely human: the ability to know what matters, wh=
at works, and what's worth doing in the first place. A surprising amount of=
 the rest is becoming=E2=80=A6just computation.</p><div class=3D"subscripti=
