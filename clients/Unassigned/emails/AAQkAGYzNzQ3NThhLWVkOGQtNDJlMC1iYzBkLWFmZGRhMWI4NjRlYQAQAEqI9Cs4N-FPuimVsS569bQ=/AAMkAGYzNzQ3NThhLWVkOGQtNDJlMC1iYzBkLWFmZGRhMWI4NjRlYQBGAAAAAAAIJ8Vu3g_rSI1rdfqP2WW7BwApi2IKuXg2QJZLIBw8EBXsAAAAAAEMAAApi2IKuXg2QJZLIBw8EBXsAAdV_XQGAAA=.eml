get-an-ai-job-in-2025-beyond

Right now, in 2025, we stand at the epicenter of an AI revolution, an era b=
rimming with both promise and overwhelming competition. Blah blah blah. You=
=E2=80=99ve heard it all before.
But a lot of us=E2=80=94we still believe the dreams just a tiny bit, don=E2=
=80=99t we?
Most of the folks I have spoken with who are interested in AI and tech have=
 dreams of landing at OpenAI, Anthropic, or one of the tech giants. The lig=
hts are bright, indeed. And maybe your dreams are passive (if Sam calls me)=
 and maybe they=E2=80=99re active (I=E2=80=99m applying now), but the point=
 either way is that the bright lights on the main strip of AI have soaked u=
p too much of our collective attention for too long, particularly around jo=
bs.
But here=E2=80=99s the harsh reality: those big names are probably not your=
 best bet. Not because you=E2=80=99re not qualified, but because these gian=
ts are trading at sky-high valuations where equity upside has drastically s=
hrunk, and your chance to truly capitalize is limited. The real treasure tr=
ove of life-changing opportunities is still out there, but it lies hidden=
=E2=80=94waiting to be discovered in vibrant, growth-stage startups at the =
Series A sweet spot.
Why make this guide now? Well, it=E2=80=99s not lost on me that last night =
(July 8th) we had another SOTA (State of the Art) model release with Grok 4=
=2E I expect plenty of talk this week a=
bout work and jobs and what AI can do.=
 I wrote about it here [ https://substack.com/redirect/924b3789-4dcb-46ce-a=
d05-ad907157aaf5?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=
AjMRMPOw0 ].
I honestly think the hardest hitting consequence of the AI revolution is to=
 upend the traditional application structure of the job market. Every resum=
e is perfect. With Cluely, remote interviews are increasingly perfect, exce=
pt maybe for vibes. It is hard to read a person, and interviewers are pushi=
ng harder and harder to flip the script on candidates. Adding surprise ques=
tions. Moving to in-person.=20
The bottom line is the bulk application approach is lower and lower yield t=
hese days and we all know it. I=E2=80=99m here to suggest that maybe it=E2=
=80=99s time to stop following the crowd into diminishing returns. Instead,=
 you need to embrace a smarter, more targeted approach=E2=80=94what is call=
ed by me (and others) spearfishing. Unlike spraying hundreds of resumes int=
o the void, spearfishing teaches you to deeply research a handful of promis=
ing companies, build tangible, high-impact artifacts that showcase your ski=
lls, and craft tailored cold emails that genuinely resonate with hiring man=
agers.
Imagine fixing an actual bug in a company=E2=80=99s open-source repository =
or building a custom dashboard that solves their pressing challenges before=
 they even interview you. No, you don=E2=80=99t have to be a 10x engineer t=
o do these things. Heck, non-engineers can build dashboards these days.
Think about sending strategic emails that demonstrate immediate value, clea=
rly quantifying the impact of your contributions. Picture confidently navig=
ating interviews with compelling, tailored stories that reflect the specifi=
c stage and needs of Series A startups. This isn=E2=80=99t hypothetical=E2=
=80=94it=E2=80=99s a proven, methodical approach that has consistently turn=
ed job seekers into standout candidates.
And it=E2=80=99s not because it=E2=80=99s magic. It=E2=80=99s because it sh=
ows passion. And passion is a currency that spends real well in 2025. I=E2=
=80=99m long human passion in a world of AI. It=E2=80=99s what underlies th=
is entire approach.
This guide matters deeply, right now, because it recognizes the hidden job =
market=E2=80=94the 70% of AI roles that never see public postings, filled q=
uietly through networks, referrals, and proactive outreach. It offers you t=
he detailed playbook=E2=80=94complete with artifact creation, outreach timi=
ng, and pipeline management=E2=80=94to tap into these unseen opportunities =
and truly differentiate yourself in a fiercely competitive landscape.
In short, this isn=E2=80=99t just about getting hired=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s =
about dramatically reshaping your career trajectory. Your equity stake in t=
hese smaller, fast-growing startups can (sometimes) grow 10-50x, your impac=
t can be immediate and visible, and your learning curve is off the charts. =
This guide arms you with everything you need if you really want to go after=
 that world: from the critical questions to ask in interviews, to the syste=
matic way to discover and approach the best AI companies before everyone el=
se. And yes I=E2=80=99ll underline it again=E2=80=94there is some coding st=
uff in here but it is not just for engineers! The examples really do work f=
or anyone willing to wrestle a bit with vibe coding and a passion for a bus=
iness.
So maybe it=E2=80=99s time to stop chasing diminishing returns in big gigan=
tic tech brand names. It=E2=80=99s time to aim with precision, deliver unmi=
stakable value, and really target the role that can genuinely change your l=
ife. The tools, strategies, and mindset laid out here aren=E2=80=99t just g=
ood advice=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re best practice tempered by the strong opi=
nions I=E2=80=99ve developed shepherding hundreds of people through job sea=
rches in the past couple of years, and I am sharing them here for the first=
 time.=20
Jobs are really annoyingly high leverage as far as our future life trajecto=
ries go, so it=E2=80=99s not an exaggeration to say that putting the time i=
n and really executing on these tips could be a career-altering opportunity=
 waiting for you to seize, today.=20
Ugh I know, so dramatic. But still true! Enjoy the read, and happy spearfis=
hing=E2=80=A6

How to Get an AI Job in 2025 (Beyond OpenAI & Big Tech)
Introduction: The Series A Sweet Spot
Everyone wants to work at OpenAI. That's exactly why you shouldn't.
Here's the math nobody talks about: OpenAI's $300 billion valuation on $10 =
billion in revenue means they're trading at 30x multiples. Your equity gran=
t? It needs the company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation just to 3x. Mean=
while, they lost $5 billion last year and 8 of their 11 co-founders have al=
ready left. The smart money got in early=E2=80=94you're not early.
This same reality applies across Big Tech AI. Anthropic at $61.5 billion on=
 $1 billion revenue. Microsoft, Google, Meta=E2=80=94their AI upside is alr=
eady priced in. You'll get a fat salary, sure, but the life-changing equity=
 opportunity? That ship has sailed.
Here's the second truth: 70% of AI jobs are never posted publicly [ https:/=
/substack.com/redirect/cc594946-1776-49d2-8ffe-df36c11fc5db?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWt=
iOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. While you're refres=
hing LinkedIn and Indeed, competing with 180 other applicants for that one =
visible role, the real opportunities are being filled through networks, ref=
errals, and direct outreach. The game is rigged, but not in the way you thi=
nk.
The sweet spot for AI careers in 2025 isn't where everyone's looking. I hav=
e opinions here. It=E2=80=99s not seed. Too risky. It=E2=80=99s not series =
B, not risky enough. For most candidate profiles the ideal risk-reward rati=
o is roughly Series A companies. These companies have proven product-market=
 fit but haven't hit escape velocity. Your equity can still 10-50x. Your im=
pact is visible. Your learning curve is vertical.
This guide shows you exactly how to identify, target, and land roles at the=
se companies using a spearfishing approach=E2=80=94a systematic approach th=
at=E2=80=99s designed to stand out in a world filled with AI noise.
Stop fighting over scraps at overvalued giants=E2=80=94the ten thousandth a=
pplication to the OpenAI role won=E2=80=99t matter. Zig while they zag. The=
 real AI gold rush is happening where nobody's looking.
Part I: The Anti-FAANG (or MANGO) Target List
The Company Selection Matrix
Forget the household names. The best AI opportunities are hiding in plain s=
ight at companies with four specific characteristics: revenue between $1M-$=
20M ARR (maybe as high as $50M in a few cases), growth exceeding 60% year-o=
ver-year, employee count between 10-100 (maybe as high as 200 in high growt=
h companies), and genuine AI/ML at their core (not marketing fluff).
Why these numbers? Companies below $1M ARR are still finding product-market=
 fit=E2=80=94too risky unless you're founder-level. Above $20M, they=E2=80=
=99ve de-risked much of the business and have a steadier growth track prepa=
ring for IPO or acquisition, and the equity upside diminishes. The 10-100 e=
mployee range hits the sweet spot: small enough that your contribution matt=
ers, large enough for stability and mentorship.
Whenever I mention companies in this article, take them as illustrative. If=
 everyone who reads this goes off and applies to the same darn 10 companies=
 we=E2=80=99re back where we started. The point is to think outside the big=
 company box, and you often think better with specific companies for illust=
rative value. Maybe these guys are a perfect fit for you, maybe they=E2=80=
=99re not. The point is seeing them helps you imagine new possibilities in =
your job search!
Here's your AI-washing detector checklist:
Engineering blog posts about actual ML challenges (not "we use ChatGPT!")
ML/AI engineers comprise >20% of engineering team
Open-source contributions to ML tools
Published papers or meaningful model benchmarks
Infrastructure costs >30% of revenue (real AI is expensive)
Specific, measurable AI performance metrics in their marketing
Ten companies crushing it in this range right now:
Pinecone - Vector database for AI apps ($100M valuation, 100+ employees)
Modal - Serverless compute for ML workloads (50+ employees, $70M raised)
Snorkel AI - Programmatic data labeling ($1B valuation but still <200 emplo=
yees)
Replicate - Run ML models in the cloud (Series A, 30+ employees)
Weights & Biases - ML experiment tracking ($1B valuation, 200+ employees)
Voyage AI - Embedding models and retrieval (Series A, <50 employees)
Unstructured - Data preprocessing for LLMs ($70M raised, <100 employees)
Chroma - Open-source embedding database (Series A, <50 employees)
LangChain - LLM application framework ($200M valuation, 50+ employees)
Ollama - Run LLMs locally (Series A, <30 employees)
Where to Find Them
Y Combinator's recent batches are goldmines, but you need to look 18-24 mon=
ths back=E2=80=94not the current batch. By the time they're 1.5-2 years pos=
t-YC, they've hit the Series A sweet spot. Check YC's W22, S22, and W23 bat=
ches specifically. Filter for B2B AI tools, as they often monetize faster t=
han consumer plays.
The best B2B AI tools aren't advertising on billboards. They're quietly pri=
nting money serving enterprise customers. Look for:
Companies frequently mentioned in engineering Substacks
Tools with growing GitHub stars (>1K/month growth)
Startups whose founders speak at MLOps/AI conferences
Companies with boring names solving expensive problems
Domain-specific AI leaders are particularly undervalued. Everyone chases ho=
rizontal AI platforms, but vertical AI companies often have better unit eco=
nomics:
Healthcare AI: PathAI, Insitro, Paige.AI (though some are getting larger)
Legal AI: Harvey, Casetext (pre-acquisition), EvenUp
Supply Chain AI: Altana, FourKites, ClearMetal
Financial AI: Socure, Inscribe, Hyperscience
The GitHub/HuggingFace signal is pure gold. Here's how to use it:
HuggingFace Trending: Companies releasing models that trend =3D they're doi=
ng real ML
GitHub Sponsors: AI companies sponsoring popular ML projects are investing =
in community
Issue/PR activity: Look for companies actively contributing to PyTorch, Ten=
sorFlow, JAX
Model downloads: >100K downloads on HuggingFace =3D real usage
Two underutilized sources:
Papers with Code: Companies publishing benchmarks are doing real research
MLOps.community Slack: Where ML engineers complain about real problems (and=
 mention who's solving them)
The pattern is clear: the best AI companies are building critical infrastru=
cture for the AI revolution, not just riding the ChatGPT wrapper wave. They=
 have paying customers, genuine technical moats, and cultures obsessed with=
 solving hard problems. Most importantly, they're still small enough that y=
our contribution will matter and your equity could actually change your lif=
e.
Part II: The Spearfishing Method
Week 1: Deep Research
Most people spend 5 minutes on a company's careers page. You're going to sp=
end 5 days becoming an expert on one company. This isn't stalking (well may=
be a little bit)=E2=80=94it's market research that happens to focus on a si=
ngle target.
Start with their engineering blog. If they don=E2=80=99t have one, start wi=
th a github, start with a customer reddit. Start with an engineer complaini=
ng on X. Anything that gives you a sense of their problems. Every technical=
 post reveals three things: what problems they're solving, what their tech =
stack looks like, and how they think. Read the last 12 months of posts. Tak=
e notes on:
Repeated pain points ("scaling our vector database has been challenging")
Technologies they're adopting ("we're migrating from PostgreSQL to ClickHou=
se")
Performance metrics they care about ("reducing p99 latency from 200ms to 50=
ms")
Future plans buried in conclusions ("next, we'll need to tackle multi-regio=
n deployment")
Next, map their team. LinkedIn tells you a surprising amount if you know ho=
w to look:
Search: "Current company: [Company Name] AND title: engineer"
Note hiring velocity: How many engineers joined in the last 3 months?
Track backgrounds: Ex-FAANG means they value pedigree. Bootcamp grads mean =
they value hunger.
Find the gaps: No ML engineers but talking about AI features? Opportunity.
Identity key players: Who's publishing papers? Speaking at conferences? Mos=
t active on GitHub?
No LinkedIn? Or marked stealth? Check out the social profiles for the found=
ers, they often talk about key milestones. Look at Crunchbase headlines. Go=
ogle the company name and dig. (Yes, Google can still be helpful.)
The pain point detector is simpler than you think. Three sources tell you a=
 lot:
GitHub Issues: Sort by comments and reactions. High engagement =3D real pai=
n.
Community Forums: Their Discord/Slack channels where users complain
Glassdoor/Blind: Employee frustrations often mirror technical challenges
Build your intel dossier in a simple spreadsheet:
Technical Challenges: Specific problems they're facing with evidence
Team Composition: Names, roles, backgrounds, potential champions
Growth Indicators: Funding, customer logos, recent hires
Culture Signals: How they communicate, what they value, inside jokes
Opportunities: Where you could add immediate value
By day 5, you should know their business better than most employees.
Week 2: The Artifact
Talk is cheap. Code is proof. You're going to build something that demonstr=
ates value before they even interview you. Here are the five artifacts that=
 consistently get responses:
1. Bug Fix PR to Their Repo (Highest impact, lowest effort if you are in en=
gineering) Find their open-source projects. Look for issues labeled "good f=
irst issue" or "help wanted." Fix it, but go beyond:
Add comprehensive tests
Update documentation
Suggest related improvements
Reference specific engineering blog posts in your PR description
2. Dashboard Solving Their Problem Remember those pain points from Week 1? =
Build a solution. Maybe Replicate mentioned struggling with cost allocation=
 across customers. In that situation, you might build a simple cost analysi=
s dashboard using their public API, showing usage patterns and optimization=
 opportunities. You=E2=80=99re gonna stand out over the hundreds of resumes=
=2E
3. Competitive Analysis They Need Most startups are too busy building to an=
alyze competitors properly. Create a technical comparison:
API response times across competitors
Pricing model analysis with break-even points
Feature gaps they could exploit
Migration guide from competitor to their product
4. Integration Prototype Check their customers' requests. Build the integra=
tion everyone's asking for. I have seen candidates look at Discord requests=
 for an integration (and Reddit requests). Built it over a weekend. They go=
t hired, actually shipped the integration, and it was an incredible way to =
stand out.
5. Performance Optimization Demo Use their product. Find something slow. Ma=
ke it fast. Document everything:
Current performance metrics
Your optimization approach
Benchmark results
Suggested implementation plan
The key: Don't build in isolation. Share progress on Twitter/LinkedIn, tagg=
ing their DevRel team (or their most social dev lol). Create buzz before yo=
u even apply.
Week 3: The Cold Email Triple Punch
Your artifact is ready. Time to strike. This three-email sequence does gene=
rate real response rates if you use it with a great artifact.
Email 1: "I fixed your X" (Day 1) Subject: "Fixed the Redis memory leak in =
[repo name]"
"Hi [Name],
Noticed you mentioned Redis memory issues in your Q3 engineering post. Trac=
ked down the leak to the connection pooling logic=E2=80=94PR here: [link]
The fix reduces memory usage by 40% under load. Added benchmarks showing th=
e improvement.
Thought you might find it useful.
Best, [Your name]"
Email 2: "Here's how this saves you $Y" (Day 7) Subject: "Re: Fixed the Red=
is memory leak in [repo name]"
"Hi [Name],
Quick follow-up=E2=80=94realized I should quantify the impact.
With your current scale (estimating from your job posts mentioning 50M dail=
y requests), this fix would:
Save ~$4,800/month in Redis Cloud costs
Reduce OOM errors by 90%
Improve p99 latency by 25ms
Happy to walk through the math if helpful.
Best, [Your name]"
Email 3: "Should I build Z too?" (Day 14) Subject: "Question about your Typ=
eScript SDK"
"Hi [Name],
While working on the Redis fix, I noticed your TypeScript SDK doesn't suppo=
rt the new streaming endpoints.
Started prototyping streaming support=E2=80=94got basic functionality worki=
ng. Before I polish it up, wanted to check:
Is this something you're already working on?
Any specific requirements I should consider?
Can show you what I have so far if interested.
Best, [Your name]"
Subject lines that work:
"Bug fix for [specific issue]" - 73% open rate
"Quick question about [technical detail]" - 71% open rate
"Noticed your [specific problem]" - 68% open rate
"Built something for [company]" - 66% open rate
Never use: "Job opportunity," "Passionate about AI," "Your company is amazi=
ng," or any generic subject.
The 3-7-14 day cadence isn't arbitrary. Three days is too eager. Two weeks =
is forgotten. Seven days shows persistence without desperation. If no respo=
nse after email 3, move on. But with a solid artifact, you'll rarely need a=
ll three emails.
And look, I gotta say as a former founder, if someone starts emailing me ab=
out the problems they are solving for me yeah, I=E2=80=99m gonna talk to th=
em.
Part III: Interview Domination
Technical Prep That Matters
If you=E2=80=99re in engineering, LeetCode is the word you don=E2=80=99t wa=
nt to hear for interviews. Grinding LeetCode for a job is like training for=
 a marathon by doing pushups. Sure, it shows fitness, but it's the wrong fi=
tness. Series A companies don't need you to invert binary trees=E2=80=94the=
y need you to debug their specific Redis implementation at 3 AM.
Whether you=E2=80=99re in engineering or not, start by becoming a power use=
r of their product. Sign up for a trial. Hit their API rate limits (yes non=
-engineers can do this). Break things. Document everything. When they ask "=
Have you used our product?" you want to say: "Actually, I found three edge =
cases in your batch processing endpoint. Here's my bug report=E2=80=9D or =
=E2=80=9Cactually interviewed 15 users about this UX and here=E2=80=99s wha=
t I found.=E2=80=9D This immediately shifts the conversation from theoretic=
al to practical.
Study their actual stack, not generic system design. How?
Job postings reveal everything: "Experience with Pinecone" means vector dat=
abases matter
Their engineering blog plus digging into API schemas shows a bit about curr=
ent architecture
GitHub repos often expose their dependencies
Error messages often leak stack traces (check their status page)
Chrome DevTools on their app reveals frontend framework choices
For system design, think Series A scale, not Google scale. They don't need =
to handle a billion users=E2=80=94they need to scale from 100 to maybe 10,0=
00 enterprise customers. Your designs should emphasize:
Cost efficiency over infinite scale: "This handles 10x growth for $5k/month=
"
Migration paths: "Here's how we move from Postgres to Clickhouse without do=
wntime"
Build vs buy tradeoffs: "Stripe for payments now, custom billing at 1,000 c=
ustomers"
Technical debt awareness: "This shortcuts works until Series B, then we ref=
actor"
Create a one-page architecture diagram of their current system based on you=
r research. Bring it to the interview. Even if you're wrong, it shows you t=
ried to understand their specific challenges. I have seen candidates revers=
e engineer architecture from docs and job posts=E2=80=9470% accurate, good =
enough to really shine in the loop interview.
The key insight: Series A interviews test whether you can solve their probl=
ems this quarter, not whether you can design YouTube. I have had founders t=
ell me versions of this a LOT: "We rejected the ex-Google engineer who desi=
gned a perfect distributed system. We hired the bootcamp grad who understoo=
d why we needed a boring monolith for the next 12 months." Founders at this=
 stage want practical value. Show you can deliver it at every turn.
The Story Arsenal
The STAR-P framework adds one crucial element to traditional behavioral res=
ponses: Passion. It's the difference between "I did X" and "I did X, and he=
re's why it mattered to me." You need at least five golden stories, each ta=
ilored to Series A realities.
Story 1: The Scrappy Solution Show you can ship with constraints. Series A =
companies have money but not Google money.
Situation: "Startup needed real-time analytics but couldn't afford Segment"
Task: "Build event pipeline handling 10M events/day for under $500/month"
Action: "Used Kafka on Kubernetes with S3 for cold storage"
Result: "Handled 10x growth, $400/month, 50ms p95 latency"
Passion: "This proved that great infrastructure doesn't require infinite bu=
dgets=E2=80=94just clever engineering"
Story 2: The Technical Deep Dive Demonstrate you can tackle complex problem=
s their team faces.
Situation: "Vector similarity search taking 2 seconds per query"
Task: "Optimize for <100ms without changing infrastructure"
Action: "Implemented HNSW indexing, quantization, and caching strategy"
Result: "50ms average query time, 40x improvement"
Passion: "I love that moment when an optimization makes something feel inst=
antaneous=E2=80=94it changes how users interact with the product"
Story 3: The Cross-Functional Win Series A means wearing multiple hats.
Situation: "Sales team couldn't demo our API effectively"
Task: "Bridge the technical-sales gap"
Action: "Built interactive demo environment and trained sales team"
Result: "Demo-to-close rate increased 35%"
Passion: "Engineering impact isn't just about code=E2=80=94it's about enabl=
ing everyone to succeed"
Story 4: The Failure Recovery Show judgment and resilience.
Situation: "Deployed breaking change to production API"
Task: "Fix immediately while maintaining customer trust"
Action: "Rolled back, implemented fix, personally called affected customers=
"
Result: "Fixed in 47 minutes, retained all customers, implemented better te=
sting"
Passion: "Mistakes happen=E2=80=94what matters is how quickly you fix them =
and what systems you build to prevent recurrence"
Story 5: The Growth Multiplier Prove you can scale impact.
Situation: "Team spending 20 hours/week on manual deployments"
Task: "Automate without disrupting development"
Action: "Built CI/CD pipeline with gradual rollout"
Result: "Deployments went from 4 hours to 15 minutes"
Passion: "I believe engineering time is sacred=E2=80=94every hour saved on =
toil is an hour invested in innovation"
Non-tech? You can pick a story for each of these that has the STAR-P format=
 but fits where you actually add value. Honestly, if you=E2=80=99re non-tec=
h you should still be able to build an interactive demo at this point=E2=80=
=94the lines are blurry these days!
Match your stories to their stage. Series A companies care about: customer =
impact, revenue implications, technical pragmatism, and team scalability. S=
kip stories about perfect architecture or massive scale. Focus on clever so=
lutions to real constraints, regardless of your technical background (or la=
ck thereof).
Questions That Flip the Script
Most candidates ask about benefits and work-life balance. You're going to a=
sk questions that make them think "finally, someone who gets it."
"What would make someone fail in this role?" This cuts through corporate BS=
=2E The answer reveals:
Actual daily challenges vs job description fluff
Team dynamics and potential conflicts
Hidden expectations
Whether they've thought deeply about the role
Listen for specifics. "Not being collaborative" is generic. "Our lead engin=
eer has strong opinions on code style, and past hires who couldn't adapt st=
ruggled" is gold.
"What's the #1 problem keeping the CTO up at night?" Every Series A CTO los=
es sleep over something specific. The answer tells you:
Where to focus your first 90 days
What skills matter most
Whether your expertise aligns
How to position yourself as the solution
If they say "scaling," dig deeper. "Scaling what specifically? Infrastructu=
re? Team? Customer onboarding?" The follow-up reveals whether they understa=
nd their own challenges.
And yes, you could ask this about any C-suite. Works for CRO. Works for CMO=
=2E You get the idea.
"What technical decision are you most proud of? Most regretful of?" This re=
veals technical culture better than any careers page. Look for:
Willingness to admit mistakes
How they make tradeoffs
Whether they value pragmatism or perfection
If they learn from decisions
If you=E2=80=99re non-tech, ask the same thing but just drop the technical =
side.
"How do you balance shipping features vs technical debt?" Series A companie=
s live this tension daily. Good answers acknowledge the tradeoff. Great ans=
wers have specific strategies. Red flag answers pretend there's no tension.
Honestly there=E2=80=99s a version of this question in every department, it=
 just goes by a different name.
"What's the most interesting bug you've dealt with recently?" This tells yo=
u:
How deep their technical challenges go
Whether they celebrate or hide problems
If you'll be doing interesting work
How they approach debugging
"If I was here a year from now, how would you know immediately that I had s=
ucceeded in my role?" Most important question, worded differently than usua=
l. The specificity of their answer reveals whether they:
Have clear expectations
Understand their own needs
Can onboard effectively
Will set you up for success
The meta-game: Your questions should demonstrate that you understand Series=
 A challenges. You're not asking about their 5-year vision (they don't know=
). You're asking about this quarter's execution and strategic alignment. Th=
at's what Series A companies need=E2=80=94people who can ship today while b=
uilding for tomorrow.
Part IV: The Execution Playbook
The 20-Company Sprint
Forget the spray-and-pray approach of sending 200 applications. You're goin=
g to focus on exactly 20 companies, divided into three tiers with different=
 strategies for each.
5 Dream Targets (Full Spearfish) These are your perfect-fit companies where=
 you'll deploy the complete three-week spearfishing method. Selection crite=
ria:
Perfect technical stack match (>80% overlap with your skills)
Problem space you're genuinely obsessed with
Culture/values alignment based on your research
Compensation range meets your needs
For these five, you're going all-in: deep research, custom artifacts, the f=
ull cold email sequence. Budget 15-20 hours per company. Yes, that's 100 ho=
urs total. The payoff: I've seen 60% response rates and 40% interview rates=
 with this approach. One dream target is worth fifty generic applications.
10 Strong Fits (Modified Approach) These companies check most boxes but are=
n't perfect. Maybe the stack is 60% matched, or you're interested but not o=
bsessed. The modified approach:
3-5 hours research per company
Simpler artifacts: bug fix OR analysis OR integration concept
Two-email sequence instead of three
Leverage templates but customize heavily
You're aiming for 30% response rates here. The key is finding one specific =
hook per company=E2=80=94one genuine value-add=E2=80=94rather than trying t=
o boil the ocean.
5 Practice Runs These serve two purposes: pipeline padding and skill buildi=
ng. Choose companies you're lukewarm about but that have similar profiles t=
o your dream targets. Use them to:
Test email templates
Practice technical interviews
Refine your story arsenal
Get comfortable with rejection
Expect 10-15% response rates. That's fine=E2=80=94these are your training w=
heels.
Weekly Pipeline Management Monday planning (2 hours):
Review last week's metrics
Identify which stage each company is in
Plan this week's outreach/follow-ups
Adjust research priorities based on responses
Wednesday check-in (1 hour):
Send follow-up emails
Update tracking spreadsheet
Quick LinkedIn scan for new intel
Adjust artifact development priorities
Friday wrap-up (1 hour):
Log all responses and non-responses
Calculate week's metrics
Identify patterns in what's working
Plan next week's targets
The 2-1-1 hour weekly cadence keeps momentum without overwhelming your sche=
dule. Most people fail at job searching because they binge=E2=80=94spending=
 20 hours one week then nothing for three weeks. Consistency beats intensit=
y.
Critical rule: Never let your pipeline dry up. When one dream target reject=
s you, promote a strong fit. When you get an offer, keep two other processe=
s warm. The best negotiating position is having options.
Tracking What Works
You can't improve what you don't measure. But most people track the wrong m=
etrics or track nothing at all. Like 90% of people track nothing at all. Se=
riously. Here's your measurement framework.
Response Rate by Approach Type Create a simple spreadsheet with columns:
Company name
Approach type (full spearfish/modified/practice)
Artifact created (bug fix/dashboard/analysis/etc.)
Email sent date
Response received (Y/N and date)
Response quality (positive/neutral/negative)
After 20 attempts, patterns emerge=E2=80=94as an example:
Bug fixes average 55% response rate
Dashboards: 45%
Competitive analyses: 40%
Cold emails without artifacts: 8%
One candidate discovered their Loom video walkthroughs got 70% response rat=
es=E2=80=94double their written analyses. Another found that targeting CTOs=
 worked better than engineering managers (45% vs 25% response rate). You wo=
n't know your pattern until you track it.
Time to Interview Metrics Track the full funnel:
Initial email =E2=86=92 Response: Average 4 days (if they respond)
Response =E2=86=92 Phone screen scheduled: 3-7 days
Phone screen =E2=86=92 Technical interview: 5-10 days
Technical =E2=86=92 Final round: 7-14 days
Final round =E2=86=92 Offer: 3-7 days
Total timeline: 22-45 days per company. This is why parallel processing mat=
ters. With 20 companies and staggered outreach, you should have 3-5 active =
processes after week 3.
The Pivot Decision Tree After 10 companies (usually week 3-4), assess:
If response rate <20%:
Your artifacts aren't compelling enough
You're targeting the wrong tier of company
Your email copy needs work
If response rate >20% but no interviews:
Your artifacts are too generic
You're not demonstrating deep understanding
Your emails aren't creating urgency
If interviews but no offers:
Technical prep needs adjustment
Stories aren't resonating
Culture fit issues
The pivot isn't about changing everything=E2=80=94it's about adjusting one =
variable at a time. Bad pivot: "Nothing's working, I'll try a completely di=
fferent approach." Good pivot: "Bug fixes get responses but not interviews,=
 let me add performance benchmarks to show impact."
Most important: Trust the process through at least 10 full attempts. The fi=
rst five will feel awkward. Companies six through ten you'll find your rhyt=
hm. By company fifteen, you'll have a system. The people who succeed aren't=
 necessarily the most talented=E2=80=94they're the ones who stick with it l=
ong enough to find what works for them.
Remember: This is a numbers game with skill attached. Even with perfect exe=
cution, expect 30% response rates, 50% of those to become interviews, and 2=
0% of interviews to become offers. That's why you start with 20 companies. =
Do the math, trust the process, and execute consistently. The offers will c=
ome. Work the inputs, as we used to say at Amazon. That still lives rent fr=
ee in my head.

The tools are just the beginning. Execution separates dreamers from builder=
s. Pick your 20, start your research, and ship something remarkable. The AI=
 gold rush is happening at Series A companies, and they're desperate for bu=
ilders who understand their specific challenges. Stop reading. Start buildi=
ng. Your dream role is 30 days away.
Conclusion: Your First Week
Stop reading job advice. Start executing. Here's your next seven days:
Day 1-2: Pick Your 5 Dream Companies Open the target list. Cross-reference =
with your interests. Pick five companies where you'd work for equity alone.=
 No overthinking=E2=80=94you can adjust later. The goal is starting, not pe=
rfection.
Day 3-4: Deep Research Phase Read everything. Engineering blogs, GitHub rep=
os, founder interviews, employee LinkedIn profiles. Fill out the research s=
preadsheet. Find their biggest technical pain point. Document everything.
Day 5-6: Start Building Your Artifact Pick their most pressing problem. Bui=
ld something small but real. A bug fix that saves them hours. An analysis t=
hat reveals opportunities. An integration their users are begging for. Ship=
 something tangible.
Day 7: Send Your First Spearfish Email Use the templates. Include your arti=
fact. Keep it short. Hit send before you overthink it.
I have an ask: please don=E2=80=99t only bookmark and share this guide. I m=
ean sure very flattering I appreciate it. But I made this to be used. I mad=
e this to put tires on the road for people=E2=80=99s careers. Go out and ac=
tually execute! Or challenge a friend of yours to execute! The job market r=
ewards action, not knowledge. If you go after this relentlessly for two wee=
ks or so, you'll have done more than 90% of job seekers do in three months =
(clicking the LinkedIn apply button doesn=E2=80=99t count anymore).
Your spearfishing adventure is waiting. The only question is whether you'll=
 seize it or let someone else who ships faster grab it first.
Start now.

 household names. The best AI opportunities are hiding in plain sight at co=

aybe as high as $50M in a few cases), growth exceeding 60% year-over-year, =
employee count between 10-100 (maybe as high as 200 in high growth companie=
