TURKEY, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE FUTURE OF US MIDDLE EAST STRATEGY [3]
RIYADH AND ITS GULF ALLIES ARE COUNTING ON THEIR CASH TO KEEP ANKARA IN CHECK.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
The Trump administration’s foreign policy is based on the principle that allies and partners will take the lead in securing their regions. In the Middle East, this responsibility falls primarily on
Turkey and Saudi Arabia – the two main Sunni powers, one non-Arab and the other Arab. Though the two states appear aligned for now, they remain geopolitical competitors. Their ability to work
together depends not only on bilateral relations but also on the influence of Israel and Iran.
[Middle East] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
At a joint press conference in Damascus on May 31, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan announced that Saudi Arabia and Qatar will jointly finance salaries for Syrian state employees. The
news came a couple of weeks after Riyadh and Doha made a $15 million debt payment to the World Bank on Syria’s behalf. A week earlier, on May 24, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa made a surprise
visit to Turkey – his second since taking office – to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Al-Sharaa expressed interest in building “deep strategic cooperation” with Ankara. His visit
followed a trip to Riyadh, where he met with U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (better known as MBS), with Erdogan attending virtually.
The immediate concern for both Turkey and Saudi Arabia is Syria, which has become the regional center of gravity since the fall of the Assad regime in December. Although Iran has been pushed out of
the Levant, it remains entrenched across Syria’s eastern border in Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel has established a military buffer zone well beyond the Golan Heights in Syria’s southwest. For Ankara and
Riyadh, overcoming the region’s many challenges – Iran’s future role, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Houthis in Yemen, to name a few – will necessitate cooperation, but competition
is also inevitable.
Saudi Arabia, as the world’s top oil producer and exporter, wields immense financial power but lacks military capacity. Turkey, with NATO’s second-largest standing army and a growing defense
industry, suffers from economic instability, high inflation and currency depreciation. Neither power can shape the region alone, forcing them into tactical cooperation – at least in the short term.
Domestically, both nations are undergoing extended and extensive transformations. Under MBS, Saudi Arabia is rapidly evolving from being the cradle of Salafism – the most austere form of Sunni Islam
– to a modern state. His Vision 2030 initiative aims to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. At the same time, Washington’s move to limit its exposure to global
risks is pushing the kingdom into a leadership role both regionally and globally.
Turkey, meanwhile, has spent nearly two decades in flux under Erdogan. The country has moved beyond its Western orientation and now pursues influence across its strategic periphery, which includes the
Arab world, Turkic nations and broader Muslim regions. However, on the home front, the popularity of Erdogan and his political party has waned, raising questions about the future of Turkey’s
political system in a post-Erdogan era.
Historical grievances dating from the mid-18th century also shape the modern rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The founding of the first Saudi state in 1744 posed the most serious internal
challenge the Ottoman Empire faced from the Arab world, costing it control over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. In response, Ottoman-backed Egyptian forces dismantled the Saudi regime in
1818. The Saudis staged a comeback in 1824 with the second Saudi state, which the Ottomans defeated in 1891 by supporting a rival Arabian tribe. World War I and its aftermath, including the collapse
of the 623-year-old Ottoman Empire, provided the Saudis with an opportunity to establish their third regime, the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For much of the 20th century, the Republic of Turkey and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia developed in isolation from each other. Turkey was a radical secular (and, by the 1940s, a democratic) state that
saw itself as part of the West. Its only interest in the Middle East was the issue of Kurdish separatism. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, was a deeply religious but pro-Western monarchy that in the
1940s became a major oil exporter. Their only common denominator was that, after World War II, both became U.S. allies in the Cold War.
Following the implosion of the Soviet Union, both countries were challenged by different strands of Islamism. In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia faced jihadist threats from al-Qaida, while Turkey dealt with
the rise of Muslim Brotherhood-style Islamists, who briefly took power in 1996. These parallel dynamics laid the groundwork for future geopolitical confrontation.
The 9/11 attacks and the U.S. response accelerated change in both countries. Saudi Arabia began modernizing, while Turkey drifted away from radical secularism. The U.S. effort to disengage from the
region since the Obama administration, combined with the Arab Spring uprising, created an opportunity for Turkey (in concert with Qatar) to expand its influence through the Islamist opposition,
bringing it into direct conflict with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The Saudi-led bloc eventually succeeded in suppressing those Islamist movements.
Turkey’s regional setbacks, compounded by economic decline, forced it to pursue rapprochement with the Arab states. Improved relations have been driven by mutual concern over Iranian expansion. Yet
Arab leaders view Turkey’s financial troubles as temporary and do not want to see Turkish influence replace Iran’s in the long run. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, especially the UAE, hope
that economic investment and trade ties can keep Ankara in check.
The regime change in Syria is now the first major test of this uneasy alignment. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have set aside their concerns with al-Sharaa’s Islamist ties and Turkish backing. Their goal
is to prevent Turkey from dominating post-Assad Syria by taking advantage of Ankara’s reliance on Gulf Arab financing for Syria’s reconstruction. It is unclear whether the young partnership will
survive – let alone how it will handle more polarizing issues, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These two pillars of the Trump administration’s regional strategy therefore constitute a
major area of fragility.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Trump administration’s foreign policy is based on the principle that allies and partners will take the lead in securing their regions. In the Middle East, this responsibility falls primarily on Turkey and Saudi Arabia – the two main Sunni powers, one non-Arab and the other Arab. Though the two states appear aligned for now, they remain geopolitical competitors. Their ability to work together depends not only on bilateral relations but also on the influence of Israel and Iran.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">At a joint press conference in Damascus on May 31, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan announced that Saudi Arabia and Qatar will jointly finance salaries for Syrian state employees. The news came a couple of weeks after Riyadh and Doha made a $15 million debt payment to the World Bank on Syria’s behalf. A week earlier, on May 24, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa made a surprise visit to Turkey – his second since taking office – to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Al-Sharaa expressed interest in building “deep strategic cooperation” with Ankara. His visit followed a trip to Riyadh, where he met with U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (better known as MBS), with Erdogan attending virtually.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The immediate concern for both Turkey and Saudi Arabia is Syria, which has become the regional center of gravity since the fall of the Assad regime in December. Although Iran has been pushed out of the Levant, it remains entrenched across Syria’s eastern border in Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel has established a military buffer zone well beyond the Golan Heights in Syria’s southwest. For Ankara and Riyadh, overcoming the region’s many challenges – Iran’s future role, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Houthis in Yemen, to name a few – will necessitate cooperation, but competition is also inevitable.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Saudi Arabia, as the world’s top oil producer and exporter, wields immense financial power but lacks military capacity. Turkey, with NATO’s second-largest standing army and a growing defense industry, suffers from economic instability, high inflation and currency depreciation. Neither power can shape the region alone, forcing them into tactical cooperation – at least in the short term.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Domestically, both nations are undergoing extended and extensive transformations. Under MBS, Saudi Arabia is rapidly evolving from being the cradle of Salafism – the most austere form of Sunni Islam – to a modern state. His Vision 2030 initiative aims to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. At the same time, Washington’s move to limit its exposure to global risks is pushing the kingdom into a leadership role both regionally and globally.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Turkey, meanwhile, has spent nearly two decades in flux under Erdogan. The country has moved beyond its Western orientation and now pursues influence across its strategic periphery, which includes the Arab world, Turkic nations and broader Muslim regions. However, on the home front, the popularity of Erdogan and his political party has waned, raising questions about the future of Turkey’s political system in a post-Erdogan era.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Historical grievances dating from the mid-18th century also shape the modern rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The founding of the first Saudi state in 1744 posed the most serious internal challenge the Ottoman Empire faced from the Arab world, costing it control over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. In response, Ottoman-backed Egyptian forces dismantled the Saudi regime in 1818. The Saudis staged a comeback in 1824 with the second Saudi state, which the Ottomans defeated in 1891 by supporting a rival Arabian tribe. World War I and its aftermath, including the collapse of the 623-year-old Ottoman Empire, provided the Saudis with an opportunity to establish their third regime, the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For much of the 20th century, the Republic of Turkey and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia developed in isolation from each other. Turkey was a radical secular (and, by the 1940s, a democratic) state that saw itself as part of the West. Its only interest in the Middle East was the issue of Kurdish separatism. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, was a deeply religious but pro-Western monarchy that in the 1940s became a major oil exporter. Their only common denominator was that, after World War II, both became U.S. allies in the Cold War.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Following the implosion of the Soviet Union, both countries were challenged by different strands of Islamism. In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia faced jihadist threats from al-Qaida, while Turkey dealt with the rise of Muslim Brotherhood-style Islamists, who briefly took power in 1996. These parallel dynamics laid the groundwork for future geopolitical confrontation.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The 9/11 attacks and the U.S. response accelerated change in both countries. Saudi Arabia began modernizing, while Turkey drifted away from radical secularism. The U.S. effort to disengage from the region since the Obama administration, combined with the Arab Spring uprising, created an opportunity for Turkey (in concert with Qatar) to expand its influence through the Islamist opposition, bringing it into direct conflict with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The Saudi-led bloc eventually succeeded in suppressing those Islamist movements.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Turkey’s regional setbacks, compounded by economic decline, forced it to pursue rapprochement with the Arab states. Improved relations have been driven by mutual concern over Iranian expansion. Yet Arab leaders view Turkey’s financial troubles as temporary and do not want to see Turkish influence replace Iran’s in the long run. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, especially the UAE, hope that economic investment and trade ties can keep Ankara in check.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The regime change in Syria is now the first major test of this uneasy alignment. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have set aside their concerns with al-Sharaa’s Islamist ties and Turkish backing. Their goal is to prevent Turkey from dominating post-Assad Syria by taking advantage of Ankara’s reliance on Gulf Arab financing for Syria’s reconstruction. It is unclear whether the young partnership will survive – let alone how it will handle more polarizing issues, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These two pillars of the Trump administration’s regional strategy therefore constitute a major area of fragility.</p>
