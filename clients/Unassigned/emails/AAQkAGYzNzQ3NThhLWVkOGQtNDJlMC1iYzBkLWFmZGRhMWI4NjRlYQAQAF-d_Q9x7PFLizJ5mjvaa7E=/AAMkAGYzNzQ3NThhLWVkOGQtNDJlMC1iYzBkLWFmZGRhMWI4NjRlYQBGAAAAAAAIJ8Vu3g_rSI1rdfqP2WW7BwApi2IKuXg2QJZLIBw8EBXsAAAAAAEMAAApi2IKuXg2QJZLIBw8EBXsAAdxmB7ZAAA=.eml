SERBIAN PROTESTS AT A TURNING POINT [3]
WHAT HAPPENS IN SERBIA OFTEN DOESN’T STAY IN SERBIA.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
Last week’s demonstrations in Serbia marked a dramatic escalation in a protest movement that began late last year over the collapse of a train station canopy in Novi Sad. The tragedy, which killed
16 people, was widely blamed on corruption and government negligence, and triggered calls for accountability, fair elections and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic’s authoritarian practices.
Though the demonstrations in Belgrade and Novi Sad on Aug. 13 were the largest yet, and saw the most violent clashes with police, protests have occurred in towns and villages across Serbia.
Indeed, the protests evolved this spring into the largest civic mobilization in contemporary Serbian history. In February and March, they drew hundreds of thousands of people, combining student
demonstrations with teachers’ strikes and union actions. Grassroots plenums and neighborhood forums were also planned across the country. Despite intimidation, arrests and even the reported use of
sonic weapons to disperse crowds, the movement remained largely peaceful and disciplined throughout much of the spring.
The anti-corruption cause has since spread beyond Serbia. Serbian students organized a marathon rally to Brussels to communicate their message to EU representatives, and supporters in Hungary held
their own protests over similar concerns with the government in Budapest. But after the demand for snap elections went unanswered, tensions boiled over in late June when the first violent clashes
between demonstrators and riot police signaled a dramatic shift. By mid-summer, heavily armed police and plainclothes security were fixtures at demonstrations, while claims of authoritarian tactics
and abuse grew.
As fear spread, demonstrations dwindled in July. But then opposition parties started formally aligning with student groups, and Vucic’s own supporters began staging counter-demonstrations and
camping out near the presidential palace. This escalated tensions, culminating in the clashes last week. They caught many off-guard, in part because they erupted during the usual summer lull in
politics.

The unrest also persisted through a period of relative parliamentary stability. The governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its junior coalition partner, the Socialist Party of Serbia, have a
comfortable majority – around 147 of 250 seats – enabling them to control legislation and resist public pressure. Meanwhile, the opposition remains fragmented. Three parties – the Freedom and
Justice Party, the Democratic Party and the Green‑Left Front – have voiced support for the protesters and are in talks to collaborate if snap elections are called. The protest movement itself is
leaderless and student-driven, raising questions about its ability to force change at the institutional level.
According to reports, on the night of Aug. 13, SNS supporters in Novi Sad instigated clashes with the anti-government demonstrators, throwing flares, firecrackers, sticks and truncheons and prompting
police to intervene. The violence spread to Belgrade and other cities. Party offices were reportedly firebombed, and dozens were injured or arrested. The protest movement now faces a turning point.
Supporters of the government say the protesters are unruly, but opponents say the government is provoking unrest to delegitimize the movement and justify its crackdown.
Vucic has repeatedly characterized the protests as an attempted color revolution, suggesting that demonstrators – sponsored by foreign interests – want to overthrow the government. In March,
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin thanked Russia’s intelligence services for helping rebuff these efforts, including by providing information about attempts to destabilize the government.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic added fuel to the fire, pointing to the arrests of several foreign nationals during the recent unrest, including a Croatian citizen and a Slovenian of Serbian origin.
Dacic said the Slovenian detainee had studied intelligence in the United States, suggesting that this confirmed foreign involvement in the demonstrations. Local media and social media accounts
likewise allege that the U.S. is behind the protests, but there is no verifiable evidence to that effect.
Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Hungary, which has strengthened its ties with Moscow, said just days before the August clashes that the European Union sought to unseat governments that defied it
– including those in Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia – placing the events in Serbia within a broader struggle against EU interference in national affairs. The comment came after Russia’s Foreign
Intelligence Service said the European Commission was seeking regime change in Budapest. That statement raised eyebrows among the Hungarian opposition, which feared Russia could be hinting at its
willingness to help the government stay in power.
The Slovak government has watched the Serbian unrest with unease. Last December, Prime Minister Robert Fico’s visit to Moscow triggered widespread demonstrations over his ties to Russia. The Slovak
public is also increasingly frustrated over cronyism, systemic corruption and socio-economic challenges in the country – grievances that helped catalyze protest movements there in the past. On Aug.
15, after facing criticism for not defending Slovak citizens who were assaulted in the Serbian demonstrations, Fico accused the opposition of planning protests similar to those in Serbia.
The governments in Belgrade, Budapest and Bratislava are thus all using a similar playbook, pushing unsubstantiated narratives about Western meddling in order to inspire a nationalist backlash. But
many of the protesters have themselves criticized the EU, accusing the bloc of trying to stay out of the situation and failing to defend democratic values. In Serbia, an official candidate to join the
EU since 2012, public support for EU membership has dropped significantly: In a recent poll, 52 percent of Serbians said they would vote against joining the bloc, while only 39 percent said they would
vote in favor. By comparison, a Balkan-wide survey early last year found that 34 percent of Serbians were opposed to joining, while 40 percent said they supported it.
In fact, it is Vucic who has recently emphasized Serbia’s deepening EU ties, making diplomatic overtures and introducing limited reforms to get in Brussels’ good graces. Many protesters, however,
say they’ve seen little or no tangible economic benefits from these efforts. They view the political elite as opportunistic, willing to do business with anyone – even the EU – to get ahead. They
increasingly believe the European Union tolerates such behavior to avoid having to deal with another crisis on its doorstep.
Protesters also point to the country’s sluggish economic growth. The Serbian central bank, which in February predicted 4.5 percent growth, recently cut its 2025 growth forecast to 2.75 percent.
Inflation hovers around 5 percent.
Hungary is experiencing similar economic strain. In July, the government sharply downgraded its economic growth forecast, from 2.5 percent to just 1 percent. Inflation is well above 4 percent,
including more than 6 percent for food, despite temporary price controls. The growing frustration is compounded by the government’s clientelism and perceived self-enrichment, eroding trust in Prime
Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, particularly in rural areas that historically have been loyal.
A few striking coincidences may indicate where the situations are headed. On the same day last week that violence erupted in Serbia, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service released a report alleging
that the EU was working to topple the governments of Slovakia, Serbia and Hungary. The report came just one day before the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir
Putin in Alaska, ostensibly focused on Ukraine but widely expected to touch on other areas of U.S. and Russian concern.
Then, on Aug. 18, Russian oil exports to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline were abruptly halted after a Ukrainian drone strike damaged a Russian pumping station. Hungary condemned the
attack as an assault on its energy security. Slovak pipeline operator Transpetrol confirmed the disruption but said the incident occurred beyond Slovakia’s borders. The damage was repaired a day
later, and deliveries to both countries were restored. But given their heavy dependence on Russian energy and the strategic importance of this pipeline, a longer suspension would have placed
additional pressure on both governments.
The unrest in Serbia cannot be understood in isolation. Events there are deeply enmeshed in broader geopolitical challenges involving both Moscow and Washington. After all, it was in the Balkans where
Russia started its resurgence after the Cold War when it positioned itself as a strategic ally to Serbia. Moscow has long argued that Washington set the precedent for disregarding international law on
territorial integrity by supporting Kosovo’s secessionist ambitions.
Surrounded by NATO member states, a candidate to EU accession but aggressively courted by Moscow, Serbia is in the middle of a geopolitical tug of war. For Brussels and Washington, ensuring that
Serbia does not drift further from the Euro-Atlantic camp is essential to preventing instability across the Balkans. For Moscow, Belgrade is one of its few remaining footholds on the Continent.
Serbia’s alignment can thus shape the strategic balance in southeastern Europe and beyond.
Developments in Serbia could also reverberate beyond its borders, influencing political dynamics in Hungary and Slovakia – two EU and NATO members heavily dependent on Russian energy. Both
governments have attempted to balance between the West and Moscow in their approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, a strategy that in practice has often placed them closer to the Russian position.
In this sense, events in Serbia are rarely about Serbian politics alone. The U.S. has little incentive to encourage a revolution there, and the EU has no interest in toppling the government in
Belgrade, especially with no credible alternative in sight. Russia appears too weak to manage a Balkan crisis, and Russian media have, surprisingly, paid relatively little attention to Serbian
politics in recent days. The silence could reflect Moscow’s preoccupation with Ukraine. Or Moscow could be biding its time before it throws a wrench into the escalating situation to complicate the
West’s already crowded international agenda.
Context is therefore crucial. After the Aug. 15 Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska, a follow-up summit in Washington brought together Trump, Ukraine’s president and key European leaders. That meeting
underscored a shift: Washington appears intent on signaling that it does not need to lead Europe on Ukraine, but rather expects Europeans to assume greater responsibility – even leadership – in
managing the conflict. The challenge, however, is that “Europe” is not a single state but a patchwork of institutions and coalitions: the EU, NATO and a coalition of the willing. Within NATO and
the EU, Hungary and Slovakia are likely to complicate consensus on whatever is next for Ukraine, even if complication only means delaying the decision-making process. And if Serbia’s internal crisis
worsens and spills into its neighbors, NATO and the EU could find themselves consumed by yet another crisis on an already destabilized front.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last week’s demonstrations in Serbia marked a dramatic escalation in a protest movement that began late last year over the collapse of a train station canopy in Novi Sad. The tragedy, which killed 16 people, was widely blamed on corruption and government negligence, and triggered calls for accountability, fair elections and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic’s authoritarian practices. Though the demonstrations in Belgrade and Novi Sad on Aug. 13 were the largest yet, and saw the most violent clashes with police, protests have occurred in towns and villages across Serbia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Indeed, the protests evolved this spring into the largest civic mobilization in contemporary Serbian history. In February and March, they drew hundreds of thousands of people, combining student demonstrations with teachers’ strikes and union actions. Grassroots plenums and neighborhood forums were also planned across the country. Despite intimidation, arrests and even the reported use of sonic weapons to disperse crowds, the movement remained largely peaceful and disciplined throughout much of the spring.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The anti-corruption cause has since spread beyond Serbia. Serbian students organized a marathon rally to Brussels to communicate their message to EU representatives, and supporters in Hungary held their own protests over similar concerns with the government in Budapest. But after the demand for snap elections went unanswered, tensions boiled over in late June when the first violent clashes between demonstrators and riot police signaled a dramatic shift. By mid-summer, heavily armed police and plainclothes security were fixtures at demonstrations, while claims of authoritarian tactics and abuse grew.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As fear spread, demonstrations dwindled in July. But then opposition parties started formally aligning with student groups, and Vucic’s own supporters began staging counter-demonstrations and camping out near the presidential palace. This escalated tensions, culminating in the clashes last week. They caught many off-guard, in part because they erupted during the usual summer lull in politics.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The unrest also persisted through a period of relative parliamentary stability. The governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its junior coalition partner, the Socialist Party of Serbia, have a comfortable majority – around 147 of 250 seats – enabling them to control legislation and resist public pressure. Meanwhile, the opposition remains fragmented. Three parties – the Freedom and Justice Party, the Democratic Party and the Green‑Left Front – have voiced support for the protesters and are in talks to collaborate if snap elections are called. The protest movement itself is leaderless and student-driven, raising questions about its ability to force change at the institutional level.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">According to reports, on the night of Aug. 13, SNS supporters in Novi Sad instigated clashes with the anti-government demonstrators, throwing flares, firecrackers, sticks and truncheons and prompting police to intervene. The violence spread to Belgrade and other cities. Party offices were reportedly firebombed, and dozens were injured or arrested. The protest movement now faces a turning point. Supporters of the government say the protesters are unruly, but opponents say the government is provoking unrest to delegitimize the movement and justify its crackdown.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Vucic has repeatedly characterized the protests as an attempted color revolution, suggesting that demonstrators – sponsored by foreign interests – want to overthrow the government. In March, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin thanked Russia’s intelligence services for helping rebuff these efforts, including by providing information about attempts to destabilize the government. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic added fuel to the fire, pointing to the arrests of several foreign nationals during the recent unrest, including a Croatian citizen and a Slovenian of Serbian origin. Dacic said the Slovenian detainee had studied intelligence in the United States, suggesting that this confirmed foreign involvement in the demonstrations. Local media and social media accounts likewise allege that the U.S. is behind the protests, but there is no verifiable evidence to that effect.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Hungary, which has strengthened its ties with Moscow, said just days before the August clashes that the European Union sought to unseat governments that defied it – including those in Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia – placing the events in Serbia within a broader struggle against EU interference in national affairs. The comment came after Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service said the European Commission was seeking regime change in Budapest. That statement raised eyebrows among the Hungarian opposition, which feared Russia could be hinting at its willingness to help the government stay in power.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Slovak government has watched the Serbian unrest with unease. Last December, Prime Minister Robert Fico’s visit to Moscow triggered widespread demonstrations over his ties to Russia. The Slovak public is also increasingly frustrated over cronyism, systemic corruption and socio-economic challenges in the country – grievances that helped catalyze protest movements there in the past. On Aug. 15, after facing criticism for not defending Slovak citizens who were assaulted in the Serbian demonstrations, Fico accused the opposition of planning protests similar to those in Serbia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The governments in Belgrade, Budapest and Bratislava are thus all using a similar playbook, pushing unsubstantiated narratives about Western meddling in order to inspire a nationalist backlash. But many of the protesters have themselves criticized the EU, accusing the bloc of trying to stay out of the situation and failing to defend democratic values. In Serbia, an official candidate to join the EU since 2012, public support for EU membership has dropped significantly: In a recent poll, 52 percent of Serbians said they would vote against joining the bloc, while only 39 percent said they would vote in favor. By comparison, a Balkan-wide survey early last year found that 34 percent of Serbians were opposed to joining, while 40 percent said they supported it.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In fact, it is Vucic who has recently emphasized Serbia’s deepening EU ties, making diplomatic overtures and introducing limited reforms to get in Brussels’ good graces. Many protesters, however, say they’ve seen little or no tangible economic benefits from these efforts. They view the political elite as opportunistic, willing to do business with anyone – even the EU – to get ahead. They increasingly believe the European Union tolerates such behavior to avoid having to deal with another crisis on its doorstep.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Protesters also point to the country’s sluggish economic growth. The Serbian central bank, which in February predicted 4.5 percent growth, recently cut its 2025 growth forecast to 2.75 percent. Inflation hovers around 5 percent.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hungary is experiencing similar economic strain. In July, the government sharply downgraded its economic growth forecast, from 2.5 percent to just 1 percent. Inflation is well above 4 percent, including more than 6 percent for food, despite temporary price controls. The growing frustration is compounded by the government’s clientelism and perceived self-enrichment, eroding trust in Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, particularly in rural areas that historically have been loyal.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A few striking coincidences may indicate where the situations are headed. On the same day last week that violence erupted in Serbia, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service released a report alleging that the EU was working to topple the governments of Slovakia, Serbia and Hungary. The report came just one day before the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, ostensibly focused on Ukraine but widely expected to touch on other areas of U.S. and Russian concern.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Then, on Aug. 18, Russian oil exports to Hungary and Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline were abruptly halted after a Ukrainian drone strike damaged a Russian pumping station. Hungary condemned the attack as an assault on its energy security. Slovak pipeline operator Transpetrol confirmed the disruption but said the incident occurred beyond Slovakia’s borders. The damage was repaired a day later, and deliveries to both countries were restored. But given their heavy dependence on Russian energy and the strategic importance of this pipeline, a longer suspension would have placed additional pressure on both governments.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The unrest in Serbia cannot be understood in isolation. Events there are deeply enmeshed in broader geopolitical challenges involving both Moscow and Washington. After all, it was in the Balkans where Russia started its resurgence after the Cold War when it positioned itself as a strategic ally to Serbia. Moscow has long argued that Washington set the precedent for disregarding international law on territorial integrity by supporting Kosovo’s secessionist ambitions.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Surrounded by NATO member states, a candidate to EU accession but aggressively courted by Moscow, Serbia is in the middle of a geopolitical tug of war. For Brussels and Washington, ensuring that Serbia does not drift further from the Euro-Atlantic camp is essential to preventing instability across the Balkans. For Moscow, Belgrade is one of its few remaining footholds on the Continent. Serbia’s alignment can thus shape the strategic balance in southeastern Europe and beyond.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Developments in Serbia could also reverberate beyond its borders, influencing political dynamics in Hungary and Slovakia – two EU and NATO members heavily dependent on Russian energy. Both governments have attempted to balance between the West and Moscow in their approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, a strategy that in practice has often placed them closer to the Russian position.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In this sense, events in Serbia are rarely about Serbian politics alone. The U.S. has little incentive to encourage a revolution there, and the EU has no interest in toppling the government in Belgrade, especially with no credible alternative in sight. Russia appears too weak to manage a Balkan crisis, and Russian media have, surprisingly, paid relatively little attention to Serbian politics in recent days. The silence could reflect Moscow’s preoccupation with Ukraine. Or Moscow could be biding its time before it throws a wrench into the escalating situation to complicate the West’s already crowded international agenda.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Context is therefore crucial. After the Aug. 15 Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska, a follow-up summit in Washington brought together Trump, Ukraine’s president and key European leaders. That meeting underscored a shift: Washington appears intent on signaling that it does not need to lead Europe on Ukraine, but rather expects Europeans to assume greater responsibility – even leadership – in managing the conflict. The challenge, however, is that “Europe” is not a single state but a patchwork of institutions and coalitions: the EU, NATO and a coalition of the willing. Within NATO and the EU, Hungary and Slovakia are likely to complicate consensus on whatever is next for Ukraine, even if complication only means delaying the decision-making process. And if Serbia’s internal crisis worsens and spills into its neighbors, NATO and the EU could find themselves consumed by yet another crisis on an already destabilized front.</p>
