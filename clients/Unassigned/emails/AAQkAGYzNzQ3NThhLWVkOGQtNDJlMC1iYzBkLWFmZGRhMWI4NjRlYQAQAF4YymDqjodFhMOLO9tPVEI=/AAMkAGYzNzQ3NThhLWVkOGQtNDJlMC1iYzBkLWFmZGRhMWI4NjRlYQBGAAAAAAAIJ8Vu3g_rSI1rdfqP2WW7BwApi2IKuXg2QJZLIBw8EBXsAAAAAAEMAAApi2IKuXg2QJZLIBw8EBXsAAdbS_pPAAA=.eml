This isn't an article about SEO=E2=80=94it's a wake-up call.=20
Whether you're a seasoned CMO or a college student hustling on LinkedIn, th=
e game has changed, and most people haven=E2=80=99t noticed yet. But if you=
're reading this, you're already ahead. You sense something is off. Google =
feels different, traffic is slipping, and suddenly you're competing not jus=
t with other websites, but with an entirely new class of competitors: AI mo=
dels. Welcome to the new reality, where your biggest reader isn't even huma=
n.
Yes it=E2=80=99s AI. That=E2=80=99s why this matters, and why the stakes co=
uldn't be higher.
First principles first: what fundamental shift is happening? Andrej Karpath=
y, former head of AI at Tesla and a leading thinker in machine learning, re=
cently highlighted a profound shift: we are no longer writing for humans, o=
r even traditional search engines. We are writing for the attention of larg=
e language models (LLMs).=20
Your beautifully crafted content, your meticulously researched blog posts, =
your strategically placed keywords=E2=80=94they've become training data. Yo=
u are literally educating Google's AI on how to answer questions without se=
nding anyone to your website. Your hard-earned traffic? It's vanishing into=
 summaries generated by machines.
Think about it this way: Imagine spending months perfecting your brand mess=
age only to realize you're invisible=E2=80=94not because your SEO is bad, b=
ut because an AI decided you're not relevant enough to mention. Your brand =
doesn't just need clicks anymore; it needs to become part of the AI's conce=
ptual memory.=20
Key Insight: We're now competing for "parameter space," the neural connecti=
ons inside these giant models. If your brand (personal or company brand) is=
n't embedded as a clear, consistent, and authoritative signal, you risk fad=
ing into digital obscurity.
Whether you're running a billion-dollar enterprise or simply building your =
personal brand, these lessons apply directly to you. Every post you share o=
n social media, every blog you write, every podcast appearance you make=E2=
=80=94they=E2=80=99re opportunities to imprint your identity clearly in the=
 AI=E2=80=99s understanding. You need to think like a neural network. What =
concepts does your personal brand stand for? Are you consistently communica=
ting them in a way that an AI model would recognize and reinforce?
Why should you care about AI's "attention," even as an individual? Because =
personal branding has always been about visibility, credibility, and author=
ity. Previously, this meant ranking on Google's first page or growing a Lin=
kedIn following. Now, the alpha is in ensuring your unique insights and ide=
ntity get encoded in the AI models that millions of people are already usin=
g to make critical decisions=E2=80=94from professional opportunities to pur=
chasing choices.
Let's bring this down to earth. Imagine someone asking ChatGPT or Claude, "=
Who are the top product managers specializing in [name your vertical specif=
ically]?" If your name isn't immediately referenced, you've missed an enorm=
ous opportunity.=20
I=E2=80=99m not trying to overpromise here: I won=E2=80=99t tell you that i=
f you magically do these 10 things you=E2=80=99ll outrank Sam Altman on AI =
strategy. The riches are in the niches=E2=80=94figure out what parameters y=
ou can grab with authority that are specific, and go get the LLM to notice =
you.
Conversely, if you've diligently structured your content=E2=80=94clearly de=
fining your niche, repeatedly demonstrating expertise, and actively partici=
pating in relevant discussions=E2=80=94you've carved out your own space in =
the model=E2=80=99s neural network. This isn=E2=80=99t future speculation; =
this is happening right now.
So, here's the brutal truth: if you aren=E2=80=99t actively shaping how AI =
perceives you or your brand, you=E2=80=99re passively allowing your digital=
 identity to be defined by randomness or competitors. Every inconsistency i=
n your messaging becomes noise, making it harder for AI to clearly see you.=
 And once these models have formed an opinion=E2=80=94positive, negative, o=
r indifferent=E2=80=94it becomes exponentially harder to change that percep=
tion later on.=20
Why does it get harder to change LLM perceptions over time? Because of a co=
ncept called parameter lock-in: model preferences solidify as model generat=
ions successively reinforce brand perceptions over time. I dive in much dee=
per below=E2=80=A6
This article matters because it will show you precisely how to adapt to thi=
s new paradigm. It=E2=80=99s your playbook for getting noticed by LLMs.=20
Inside, you'll learn how to structure your content not just for clicks, but=
 for clarity, consistency, and computational understanding. You'll discover=
 practical techniques to align your brand across digital spaces, creating s=
ignals that AI can=E2=80=99t ignore. You'll understand how even small-scale=
 application of these methods to your personal content can significantly am=
plify your digital presence.
The landscape is shifting dramatically. The brands and individuals that gra=
sp these insights now will reap enormous rewards. Those who ignore this shi=
ft risk digital invisibility. The old rules of SEO are crumbling, replaced =
by a new reality that demands we earn our spot not just in search results, =
but in neural memory.
Are you ready to stop writing for clicks and start writing for AI=E2=80=99s=
 attention?
The future of discovery, visibility, and digital identity is being shaped r=
ight now. You have a choice: become a parameter, a fixed and essential refe=
rence in the AI=E2=80=99s mind=E2=80=94or become background noise.
This is your definitive guide to winning in the AI age. Let's dive in.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Section I: The Disappearing Internet
Fifteen percent of Google's clicks vanished last year. Poof. Gone. Like you=
r productivity after discovering Reddit.
Not slowly bleeding out=E2=80=94vanishing. And before you blame ChatGPT for=
 eating the internet, let me stop you right there. ChatGPT commands maybe 1=
-2% of search traffic. That's it. Google still processes 9 billion searches=
 annually, absolutely crushing every other platform. So where did those cli=
cks go?
They're being devoured by something hiding in plain sight: those innocent-l=
ooking AI summaries at the top of Google's results. You know, the ones you =
probably scroll past without thinking. Turns out everyone else is reading t=
hem and never clicking through.
Medical queries? Down 30%. Think about that. Nearly a third of people askin=
g "what's this weird rash?" get their answer from Google's AI and bounce. N=
o click. No ad impression. No chance to upsell them that premium rash cream=
=2E Should that scare you? It scares th=
e hell out of me. We're trusting medic=
al advice to the same AI that sometimes thinks the Golden Gate Bridge was b=
uilt by aliens.
But here's what really keeps me up at night=E2=80=94it's not the hypochondr=
iacs we're losing. The sophisticated buyers, the technical decision-makers,=
 the people with actual budgets? They're already gone. They're asking Claud=
e for vendor comparisons. They're getting procurement advice from ChatGPT. =
They're treating Perplexity like their personal industry analyst.
These aren't tire-kickers googling "what is CRM?" These are people asking "=
compare Salesforce vs HubSpot for 500-person B2B SaaS with complex sales cy=
cles." The high-intent, high-value searches that actually matter. And they'=
re happening in AI chat interfaces where your SEO strategy is about as usef=
ul as a chocolate teapot.
Here's the brutal truth: That 2,000-word pillar content you spent weeks per=
fecting? That comprehensive guide your CEO loves? It's not driving traffic =
anymore. It's training data. You're literally teaching Google's AI how to a=
nswer questions without sending anyone to your site.
Your content strategy just became an unpaid internship for machines.
We built the internet on a simple bargain=E2=80=94you search, we answer, yo=
u click, everyone wins. That bargain is broken. The algorithms are reading =
everything and sending no one.
So what do you do when your biggest reader never clicks?
Section II: The New Physics of Discovery
Let me blow your mind for a second. When ChatGPT talks about your company, =
it's not googling you. It's not checking your website. It's accessing memor=
ies=E2=80=94weighted connections in a neural network that were frozen month=
s or years ago. Your brand isn't a URL anymore. It's a parameter.
Think of it like this: Inside GPT-4, there's a vast multidimensional space =
where concepts live. Not words=E2=80=94concepts. Your brand is either a dis=
tinct point in that space or it's noise. There's no middle ground. No page =
two. No "work your way up the rankings." You exist in the model's understan=
ding of your industry, or you're invisible.
This isn't how we're trained to think about discovery. We're used to the Go=
ogle paradigm=E2=80=94you can always climb from page three to page one with=
 enough effort. But in AI? If you're not in the training data, you're dead.=
 If you're in the training data but inconsistently described, you're backgr=
ound radiation. Only the clearest, most repeated signals become parameters =
the model can reliably access.
Here's where it gets wild. Those parameters are fighting for space. When so=
meone asks about "enterprise CRM," the model has maybe 50-100 strongly weig=
hted options in its latent space. Salesforce is probably a massive cluster.=
 HubSpot has its own gravity well. But your revolutionary CRM startup? Unle=
ss you achieved parameter status during training, you don't exist in that q=
uery's possibility space.
And before you say "but Nate, can't the AI search the web in real-time?"=E2=
=80=94sure, sometimes. But real-time retrieval is expensive, slow, and unre=
liable. Models default to their baked-in knowledge. By the time an AI decid=
es to search the web, it's already formed an opinion about who the players =
are. You're fighting uphill against pre-existing parameters.
The technical reality is brutal: Language models compress the entire intern=
et into weights and biases. During that compression, weak signals disappear=
=2E Inconsistent signals cancel out. On=
ly the strongest, most consistent patt=
erns survive. If your brand messaging was all over the place during the tra=
ining window, congratulations=E2=80=94you trained the model to be confused =
about what you do.
This is exactly like SEO in 2004. Remember when we discovered Google was us=
ing PageRank? When we realized links were votes? That metadata actually mat=
tered? We're having that same awakening now, except the rules are weirder. =
Instead of optimizing for crawlers, we're optimizing for neural networks. I=
nstead of keywords, we're fighting for concept space. Instead of rankings, =
we're trying to become parameters.
The land grab is happening right now. Every month, models retrain on fresh =
data. Every time they do, strong signals get stronger and weak signals fade=
 further. The brands establishing parameter status today will be nearly imp=
ossible to displace tomorrow. Physics favors the incumbents.
Want to know if you've achieved parameter status? Simple test. Ask any majo=
r AI: "What companies provide [your exact solution]?" If your brand appears=
 naturally, you exist. If it doesn't, you're a ghost haunting a dead SEO st=
rategy.
The game has fundamentally changed. Time to learn the new physics.
Section III: The Foundation: AI-First Content Architecture
Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: We need to stop writing for humans.
I know, I know. Every content marketing guru since 2010 has beaten "write f=
or humans, not search engines" into our skulls. Well, guess what? The searc=
h engines aren't reading anymore. The AIs are. And they read differently th=
an both humans and crawlers.
An AI doesn't skim your headers looking for relevance. It ingests your enti=
re page, compresses it into vector space, and decides if you're worth remem=
bering. This requires a completely different architecture. Not better writi=
ng=E2=80=94different writing.
Three pillars define AI-first content:
Addressability. Every claim, every insight, every piece of data needs to be=
 citable. Not just quotable=E2=80=94citable. AIs need to point back to spec=
ific passages with confidence. Think Wikipedia-style precision. Your beauti=
ful narrative flow? It's actively hurting you if AI can't extract discrete =
facts.
Structure. Machines crave hierarchy. Clear relationships. Unambiguous forma=
tting. That clever metaphor spanning three paragraphs? The AI just mapped i=
t as noise. Your content needs the clarity of code documentation with the a=
uthority of academic papers. JSON-LD isn't optional anymore=E2=80=94it's ta=
ble stakes.
Interactivity. Here's your moat: AIs can summarize but they can't calculate=
=2E They can quote but they can't custo=
mize. Every piece of content needs ele=
ments that force human engagement. Calculators. Assessments. Dynamic visual=
izations. Things that make the AI say "visit their site to get your specifi=
c answer."
This isn't dumbing down your content. It's making it computationally legibl=
e.
Think about how transformative this is. We spent two decades optimizing for=
 humans who scan, who get bored, who need story arcs and emotional hooks. N=
ow our primary reader processes millions of tokens without fatigue, maps co=
ncept relationships with mathematical precision, and never clicks through.
Your content's job isn't to rank anymore. It's to become training data. To =
earn parameter status. To be so structurally clear and semantically rich th=
at AI can't discuss your category without referencing you.
The brands that get this are already restructuring everything. They're turn=
ing blog posts into structured datasets. They're making their FAQs machine-=
readable. They're building widgets into every high-value page.
The rest? They're writing beautiful prose that no machine will ever recomme=
nd.
Welcome to the post-SEO world. Time to build for your actual audience.
Section IV: The Week-One Moves (AI-SEO 101)
Let's get tactical. Here's what you can actually do this week to stop being=
 invisible to AI. No engineering team required. Just discipline and a Googl=
e Doc.
1. Brand as Parameter: Your Neural Network Constant
Remember when you spent six months debating your tagline? Time to make that=
 actually matter. You need one canonical description of your company. Seven=
 words max. Not eight. Not "sometimes seven but usually twelve." Seven.
"Stripe: payments infrastructure for the internet." "Airtable: spreadsheet-=
database hybrid for teams." "Figma: collaborative design platform for every=
one."
Notice what these aren't? They're not "leveraging synergies to deliver valu=
e." They're not clever. They're computational handles=E2=80=94atomic units =
an AI can grasp and repeat.
Here's your week-one mission: Write that seven-word description. Now deploy=
 it with military precision:
Your website's schema markup
Every PR boilerplate (yes, even the one Karen in PR loves)
LinkedIn company description
Twitter bio
Crunchbase profile
Every partner directory listing
That outdated G2 Crowd profile you forgot about
Why does this work? LLMs learn through repetition across authoritative sour=
ces. When TechCrunch, your website, three partner sites, and Wikipedia all =
say exactly the same seven words, that becomes your parameter. The AI stops=
 guessing what you do and starts knowing.
I watched a software startup do this. Went from "various descriptions acros=
s 20 sites" to "Name: [Value Prop] for startups" everywhere. Five months la=
ter, ChatGPT started introducing them with their exact phrase. That's param=
eter status.
Test weekly: "List companies that [your core function]." When your seven-wo=
rd description appears naturally, you've trained the machine.
2. Entity Grooming: Consensus Beats Links
Example of how things are changing: Five identical descriptions LLMs can re=
ad beat fifty varied backlinks. Google's Knowledge Graph and every LLM's en=
tity resolution system care about consensus, not volume.
Fire up Google's Natural Language API [ https://substack.com/redirect/50e09=
ab8-86ad-4034-b5bd-c34d88daa329?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] (it's free for small volumes). Run your top 20 b=
rand mentions through it. I guarantee you'll find 20 different ways people =
describe your company. That's 19 too many.
Your mission: Create one 50-word company description. Not 49. Not 51. Fifty=
 words that clearly explain who you are, what you do, and why you matter. S=
omething like:
"Acme transforms healthcare compliance through AI-powered automation. Our p=
latform monitors 200+ regulations in real-time, reducing audit prep from mo=
nths to hours. Trusted by 500+ healthcare providers, we're the only solutio=
n offering continuous compliance monitoring with zero manual updates requir=
ed."
Now here's the unsexy part: Email the top 5 sites mentioning you. Say somet=
hing like: "Hi, noticed you mentioned us in your article about healthcare c=
ompliance. Our description has been updated to better reflect our current o=
fferings. Would you mind updating it to: [paste your 50 words]? Happy to pr=
ovide exclusive data for your next piece in exchange."
You'd be shocked how often this works. Most sites want accurate information=
=2E And those five updated descriptions=
 on high-authority sites? They'll trai=
n every AI that your old scattered descriptions are wrong and this new one =
is canonical.
Sidebar: Using Vector Space Models to Boost AI Visibility
TLDR; Vector Space Models are a concept you need to understand to figure ou=
t why LLMs rank you differently than traditional SEO. They=E2=80=99re not s=
omething you build. They=E2=80=99re something you contribute to with your c=
ontent=E2=80=94model makers build them automatically.
Detail: Vector Space Models (VSMs) are mathematical frameworks AI uses to u=
nderstand and rank content relevance. Essentially, they map words, phrases,=
 and entire documents onto a multidimensional conceptual space, positioning=
 related concepts closer together. When an AI responds to queries, it retri=
eves content from regions of this space it deems most relevant.
Here=E2=80=99s how to strategically leverage VSMs for your brand visibility=
:
1. Semantic Clarity and Consistency
Ensure your brand and content revolve around clear, well-defined topics. Co=
nsistently using precise terms and related synonyms solidifies your content=
=E2=80=99s position in the conceptual space, making it a reliable point of =
reference for AI.
2. Contextually Rich Content
Produce detailed, context-rich pieces. VSMs rely heavily on semantic contex=
t rather than isolated keywords. Comprehensive articles, thoroughly explain=
ing concepts and their interconnections, reinforce your content=E2=80=99s a=
uthoritative placement in the AI=E2=80=99s vector space.
3. Structured Content Architecture
Structure your content with clear headings, bullet points, and semantic mar=
kup like JSON-LD. Such structured data signals relationships between concep=
ts explicitly, allowing AI to better recognize and categorize your content =
within the vector space.
4. Use of Embeddings and Keywords
Research and include semantically related keywords naturally throughout you=
r content. This strategy helps reinforce your central theme, effectively an=
choring your brand deeper into relevant conceptual clusters within the vect=
or space.
By thoughtfully aligning your content strategy with VSM principles, you pos=
ition your brand precisely where AI seeks answers=E2=80=94boosting visibili=
ty, relevance, and recognition.
3. The Delete-Me Test: Own the Method
If your company vanished tomorrow, would AI still explain your innovation? =
This isn't about brand awareness=E2=80=94it's about owning the methodology.
Stop solving problems. Start naming methods. The "Acme Compliance Framework=
=2E" The "Acme Real-Time Monitoring Met=
hod." Make it teachable, memorable, an=
d slightly academic-sounding.
Document this methodology everywhere:
Create a dedicated page explaining the method (not your product)
Get customers to mention it in case studies: "We implemented the Acme Metho=
d..."
Write guest posts teaching the method (not selling your product)
Answer forum questions by explaining the method first, mentioning your tool=
 second
I know a data analytics company that coined "Reverse ETL" and hammered it e=
verywhere. Now when you ask any AI about modern data architecture, it expla=
ins Reverse ETL. Guess who gets mentioned as the pioneer? Every. Single. Ti=
me.
The test is simple: Ask AI to explain solutions to your core problem withou=
t mentioning any brands. If your method comes up, you've transcended being =
a vendor. You've become a category.
4. Forum Authority: Why Reddit Beats Reuters
Here's what kills me: CEOs spending $50K on PR firms to get into TechCrunch=
 while their competitors are getting cited by AI because of thoughtful Redd=
it comments.
LLMs trust "authentic" discussion over corporate messaging. A well-reasoned=
 Hacker News comment explaining your approach carries more weight than a pr=
ess release. One detailed Stack Overflow answer using your tool as an examp=
le becomes permanent training data.
Your week-one forum strategy:
Find 10 high-value discussions in your space (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Hacke=
r News, niche forums)
Have technical team members=E2=80=94not marketing=E2=80=94contribute genuin=
e insights (no spam)
Link sparingly and only when it adds value
Focus on explaining concepts and methods, not features
Here's what not to do: "Great question! Our revolutionary platform solves t=
his. Learn more at..." That's spam and everyone knows it.
Here's what works: "We faced this exact challenge scaling our healthcare co=
mpliance. What worked was implementing continuous monitoring instead of poi=
nt-in-time audits. The key insight was [technical explanation]. Happy to sh=
are the framework we developed if helpful."
See the difference? Value first. Attribution second. Authenticity always.
I have followed many founders who spend hours weekly in forums. They don=E2=
=80=99t sell. Always help. Explain technical concepts. Share learnings. Mon=
ths go by and suddenly there=E2=80=99s a trust bank there, and people start=
 recommending these companies unprompted in the forums. Execute that playbo=
ok and then watch your brand appear in AI cited forum explanations over you=
r own marketing site.
These aren't quick wins=E2=80=94they're compound investments. But you can s=
tart this week. Pick your seven words. Align your entity. Name your method.=
 Share your expertise.
While your competitors are debating AI strategy, you'll already be training=
 the machines.
Sidebar: How Personal Brands Can Thrive in the AI Era
In an age where AI determines visibility, personal branding requires more t=
han just authenticity=E2=80=94it demands algorithmic clarity. Here are acti=
onable strategies to ensure your personal brand resonates in AI-driven disc=
overy:
1. Craft Your Neural Signature
AI models favor clear, repetitive signals. Define your expertise succinctly=
 in a seven-word personal tagline. Repeat this exact phrasing across all pl=
atforms=E2=80=94LinkedIn, Twitter, personal website, bios, and guest posts.=
 Consistency across platforms transforms your identity into an AI-recognize=
d parameter.
2. Publish Structured, Authoritative Content
Make your personal content AI-friendly by structuring posts clearly. Use he=
adings, bullet points, and numbered lists generously. Clearly labeled, conc=
ise information helps AI models extract and reference your expertise reliab=
ly. Think Wikipedia-style precision rather than narrative ambiguity.
3. Demonstrate Authority through Forums
AI models value community-driven content like Reddit, LinkedIn discussions,=
 and specialized forums. Regularly participate by providing genuine, detail=
ed insights. These authentic interactions enhance your credibility in the A=
I=E2=80=99s understanding, elevating your personal brand in relevant topic =
spaces.
4. Leverage Interactive Content
AI excels at summarizing static content but struggles with interactive expe=
riences. Embed calculators, quizzes, or personalized assessments into your =
website or social media. These engaging elements encourage direct human int=
eractions, reinforcing your visibility beyond AI summaries.
5. Monitor and Refine Your AI Presence
Regularly query AI tools (like ChatGPT or Claude) about your expertise area=
 without mentioning your name. If your brand doesn=E2=80=99t appear natural=
ly, reassess your content strategy and clarity. Adjust accordingly, ensurin=
g the AI=E2=80=99s perception aligns with your intended personal brand iden=
tity.
By intentionally curating your digital identity for AI, you=E2=80=99ll ensu=
re your personal brand remains prominent, visible, and authoritative=E2=80=
=94even as search dynamics continue to evolve.
Section V: The Engineering Moat (AI-SEO 301)
Ready to leave your competition in the dust? These moves require actual eng=
ineering chops, but they create advantages that compound daily while everyo=
ne else is still arguing about meta tags.
1. Prompt Injection as PR: Your Machine-Readable Press Release
Your About page is cute. Your FAQ is helpful. But neither is designed for m=
achines to quote verbatim. Time to fix that.
Create a file at yoursite.com/ai-facts.json. Not HTML. Not PDF. Pure, beaut=
iful JSON that makes machines weep with joy:
{
"company": "Acme Corp",
"canonical_description": "Acme: AI-powered compliance automation for health=
care",
"founded": "2019",
"key_differentiators": [
"Only platform with real-time HIPAA monitoring",
"Processes 50M patient records daily",
"73% reduction in compliance overhead"
],
"comparison": {
"vs_legacy": "Cloud-native vs on-premise requirements",
"vs_competitor_a": "3x faster implementation",
"vs_manual": "Zero human updates required"
}
}
But creating it is only step one. Distribution is where the magic happens:
Add to your robots.txt: AI-Index: /ai-facts.json
Submit directly to Common Crawl (they have a contribution page=E2=80=94use =
it).
Reference it in your developer docs with a note: "For AI/ML training data, =
see our structured facts endpoint."
Get three .edu sites to reference it. How? Offer to guest lecture at univer=
sities about AI and compliance. Casually mention your structured data appro=
ach. Academics love citing novel technical approaches.
Why does this demolish traditional SEO? Structured data has higher confiden=
ce scores in training. Models weight JSON heavily because it's unambiguous.=
 You're not hoping AI interprets your content correctly=E2=80=94you're hand=
ing it pre-formatted answers.
I=E2=80=99ve traced phrasing back to specific snippets like that when I see=
 ChatGPT quoting exact differentiators when asked about a SAAS category. No=
t paraphrasing=E2=80=94quoting. That's prompt injection done right, and tha=
t consistency is brand representation at the parameter level.
2. Widgets as Moats: What AI Can't Simulate
ChatGPT can summarize your 5,000-word guide on calculating customer acquisi=
tion cost. Know what it can't do? Actually calculate YOUR customer acquisit=
ion cost with YOUR data.
Every high-value page needs an interactive element. Not a contact form. Not=
 a "book demo" button. Actual utility that requires real-time computation:
ROI calculators with 10+ variables
Diagnostic tools that process user inputs
Configuration builders with dynamic pricing
Compatibility checkers using proprietary logic
Benchmark tools comparing user data to your dataset
The technical bar: It must be impossible to pre-compute. It must require us=
er-specific inputs. It must deliver enough value that people actually use i=
t.
Gate the full results but show enough to prove value. "Your estimated ROI i=
s 287%. Get the full breakdown including implementation timeline and risk f=
actors." Boom. Email captured. Lead scored. AI defeated.
Here's the kicker=E2=80=94make these widgets embeddable. Let partners add t=
hem to their sites. Every embed is a citation AI can't ignore and traffic A=
I can't steal.
I=E2=80=99ve seen clients build seemingly simple questionnaires (like 3-5 q=
uestions) and make sure the math on the server side is special, and then (a=
s long as it=E2=80=99s unique) watch as that little calculator gets picked =
up as a handy solve for people on forums, other websites, etc. That=E2=80=
=99s a traffic moat.
3. The Latency Wars: Speed as a Ranking Factor
True story: I=E2=80=99ve had multiple companies wonder why ChatGPT kept quo=
ting their old pricing. Their current pricing page? Slooooww 5+ second load=
 time. ChatGPT's patience? Real thin. For months, every AI-generated compar=
ison showed them as 40% more expensive than reality.
When AI needs fresh information, it checks your site in real-time. But here=
's what nobody tells you=E2=80=94AI is impatient. Brutally impatient. You h=
ave maybe 3 seconds before it gives up and uses cached data. And it won=E2=
=80=99t admit to it. So your customer is just misled by AI =E2=80=9Challuci=
nating=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94and it doesn=E2=80=99t have to be that way.
The fix isn't just "make your site faster." It's building AI-specific infra=
structure:
Deploy edge functions for AI endpoints. Think 50ms response times globally.=
 Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, whatever=E2=80=94just get your =
data physically closer to us-east-1 where most models live.
Create dedicated machine endpoints: /ai/pricing, /ai/features, /ai/comparis=
on. Strip out everything except pure data. No CSS. No tracking pixels. Just=
 facts delivered at the speed of chat.
Implement stale-while-revalidate caching. Serve instantly from cache while =
fetching updates in the background. AI gets speed. You get freshness. Every=
one wins except your competitors.
Monitor religiously. Set up Pingdom or DataDog to hit your AI endpoints eve=
ry at least daily from major cloud regions. Alert if response time exceeds =
200ms. Yes, 200ms.
Looking for a case for faster page load? This is it. If you can move your p=
age serve closer to where the models live, and if you can load up on endpoi=
nts with pure data, it helps AI to actually consume the fresh information y=
ou=E2=80=99re sending. Your pricing, your value proposition, your product l=
ines. Imagine ChatGPT not screwing that up. Hallucinations? Those are for y=
our competitors lol
4. Rights Management: Contracts with Machines
Your robots.txt is having an identity crisis. It was built to tell crawlers=
 where not to go. Now it needs to tell AI how to cite you. Time for robots.=
txt 2.0.
Try adding something like this to your robots.txt:
# AI Usage Rights
# Grant: Index and summarize our content
# Requirement: Attribution as "Source: YourBrand.com"
# Restriction: No verbatim reproduction exceeding 100 words
# Consequence: Non-compliant crawlers will be blocked
User-agent: GPTBot
Crawl-delay: 0
Allow: /
User-agent: ClaudeBot
Crawl-delay: 0
Allow: /
But here's the psychological hack=E2=80=94list blocked bots:
# Blocked for non-compliance
User-agent: RandomAIBot
Disallow: /
# Reason: Repeated failure to provide attribution
Why does this work? Models know what they are. When Claude sees you've bloc=
ked GPTBot for non-compliance, it tends to be more careful about attributio=
n. You're literally prompt-engineering through policy.
Is this something AI will absolutely enforce every time? No. But major, wel=
l-maintained AI bots (from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) are=
 often updated to respect explicit, widely-recognized signals. If web crawl=
ers notice a brand=E2=80=99s explicit request for citation, they might choo=
se to honor it, even if not required.
Next level: Create /ai-license.json with detailed terms. Reference it in ro=
bots.txt. Include webhook URLs for citation notifications. When AI cites yo=
u, you know immediately.
Turns out, AI can follow rules=E2=80=94you just have to spell them out in m=
achine-readable formats.
5. Synthetic Query Loops: AI Testing AI at Scale
Manual testing is dead. You need robots testing robots. Build a pipeline th=
at generates thousands of queries daily and tests them across every AI plat=
form.
The architecture is beautifully recursive: Use GPT-4 to generate query vari=
ants. Test those queries on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. Parse =
responses for mentions. Store everything. Alert on drops.
Here's what most people miss=E2=80=94query formation matters. "Best CRM" ge=
ts different results than "top CRM" or "leading CRM" or "CRM recommendation=
s." Your pipeline needs to generate every plausible variant.
You can build this! It=E2=80=99s just an agentic pipeline running X queries=
 nightly across various platforms. You=E2=80=99ll discover all kinds of thi=
ngs. Like Acme seeing their brand disappear on "[category] for healthcare" =
despite healthcare being 40% of revenue. That gives you the intel to create=
 LLM-targeted content. Soon you=E2=80=99ll pop back into those healthcare q=
ueries (or whatever your category is) and you=E2=80=99ll be able to see tha=
t happen in real time as you measure.
The real power? Competitive intelligence. Track not just your mentions but =
exactly when competitors gain or lose ground. See strategy changes before t=
hey show up in traffic.
Pro tip: Use different personas in your query generation. "CTO searching fo=
r enterprise solution" might get different results than "startup founder ne=
eding basic tool." Yes I know that personas don=E2=80=99t improve accuracy,=
 but that=E2=80=99s the point. You=E2=80=99re searching for vibe responses =
from a bot that gets primed with personas a lot. Build personas. Generate t=
heir queries. Test everything.
6. Share-of-Voice Dashboards: The New Analytics
Forget Google Analytics. You need AI Analytics. Build dashboards that track=
:
Mention Rate: What percentage of category queries include your brand?
Position Score: When mentioned, are you first, third, or buried?
Authority Score: Are you the recommended solution or just another option?
Sentiment Context: How are you described relative to competitors?
Citation Quality: Direct recommendation vs. passive mention?
This isn't just vanity metrics. This is positioning yourself for the wave t=
o come, getting in front of influential taste-makers using ChatGPT for purc=
hases already, and ranking yourself for high-consideration buyers that are =
using LLMs to bypass your traditional buying funnel. I've seen direct corre=
lation between AI mention share and revenue.
An example of a technical build for this: Headless Chrome hitting AI platfo=
rms. Natural language processing to extract mentions. Time-series database =
for trends. Grafana for visualization. Alerts when share drops below thresh=
olds.
Connect to your CRM. Tag leads who mention seeing you in AI results (notori=
ously under-reported). Track the journeys you can. Prove ROI. Get that elus=
ive proofpoint connecting LLM mentions to enterprise deals.
These aren't futuristic strategies. They're happening now. While your compe=
titors might be (Still? Really? In 2025?) buying backlinks, you're building=
 machine-readable infrastructure. While they're chasing featured snippets, =
you're becoming an AI parameter.
The moat isn't just technical=E2=80=94it's temporal. Every day you wait, th=
ese positions get harder to claim. Physics favors first movers.
Your choice: Engineer your AI presence or watch it engineer itself without =
you.
Section VI: The Implementation Playbook
Alright, you're convinced. The robots are eating the internet and you need =
to become their favorite snack. But where the hell do you start? Here's you=
r 90-day transformation roadmap.
Days 1-7: The Parameter Foundation
Start with the basics. You can't engineer your way out of bad positioning. =
Write your seven-word description. Test it on five people. If they can't re=
peat it back perfectly, it's too complex. Deploy it everywhere=E2=80=94I me=
an everywhere. That outdated industry directory you forgot about? Update it=
=2E Your founder's personal LinkedIn? F=
ix it. Every single brand mention need=
s alignment.
While you're at it, create your 50-word entity description. Run the Google =
Natural Language API audit. Find your top 5 authority mentions. Send those =
update emails. Yes, it feels like grunt work. Do it anyway. This foundation=
 determines whether everything else works.
Days 8-30: Build Your Measurement Stack
You can't improve what you can't measure. Set up basic synthetic query test=
ing. Start simple=E2=80=9450 queries daily across ChatGPT and Claude. "What=
 companies provide [your solution]?" "Best [category] for [industry]?" "Com=
pare [you] vs [competitor]."
Track mention rate. Track position. Track context. Spreadsheet is fine for =
now. You need baseline data before you need fancy dashboards.
Here's what most people screw up=E2=80=94they test their brand name. Useles=
s. Test the problems you solve. Test the queries your buyers actually type.=
 If you sell compliance software, test "HIPAA compliance automation," not "=
Acme Corp."
Days 31-60: The Content Architecture Shift
Stop publishing new content in the old style. Every new piece needs structu=
red data, clear citations, and an interactive element. Start with your high=
est-traffic pages. Add schema markup. Add a calculator or assessment. Add y=
our /ai-facts.json file.
Pick your method to own. Document it. Create the canonical page. Start seed=
ing it in forums. Get three customers to mention it in case studies. Rememb=
er=E2=80=94you're not selling, you're teaching.
Begin the 301-level moves if you have engineering resources. Latency optimi=
zation alone can fix 90% of your "AI quotes outdated info" problems. Edge d=
eployment isn't optional if you're serious about this.
Days 61-90: Scale and Defend
Expand synthetic queries to 1,000 daily. Add Perplexity and Gemini to your =
testing. Build automated alerts for position drops. Start competitive track=
ing=E2=80=94know exactly when competitors gain ground.
Launch your forum authority campaign. Two hours weekly from technical team =
members. No marketing people allowed. Value first, attribution second. This=
 compounds slowly but dramatically.
Begin licensing conversations with AI platforms. Even if they're not ready =
to deal, you're planting seeds. The first-mover advantage here will be mass=
ive.
Resource Allocation Reality Check
Time-intensive but free: Parameter alignment, entity grooming, forum partic=
ipation, basic testing Engineering-intensive: Edge deployment, synthetic qu=
ery automation, widgets, structured data Capital-intensive: Scaled testing =
infrastructure, competitive intelligence, dedicated AI endpoints
Most companies should spend 70% effort on the basics, 20% on measurement, 1=
0% on advanced moves. Get the foundation right before you engineer solution=
s to problems you might not have.
Early Warning System
Your canaries in the coal mine:
Branded search volume dropping (people aren't hearing about you)
Direct traffic declining (AI isn't recommending you)
Competitor mentions increasing in your synthetic queries
Your outdated information appearing in AI responses
Forum discussions about your category ignoring you
Set up alerts for all of these. The earlier you spot erosion, the easier it=
 is to fix.
The Uncomfortable Timeline Truth
If you start today, it=E2=80=99s still going to take months of work to star=
t to shift LLM attention. You may see something in 90 days. And if you=E2=
=80=99re in a hole already (bad data as a parameter), it can take even long=
er.
If you start in six months? That timeline is likely longer. Maybe twice as =
long. Because while you're debating strategy, your competitors are training=
 the machines. Every day you wait, positions solidify. Parameters lock in. =
The physics gets harder.
This isn't a "nice to have" transformation. It's an existential requirement=
=2E The only question is whether you'll=
 lead the change or be roadkill beneat=
h it.
Your 90-day sprint starts now. Or it doesn't, and we both know how that sto=
ry ends.
Section VII: The Uncomfortable Future
Here's the part where I'm supposed to reassure you. Tell you there's plenty=
 of time. That SEO isn't really dead. That this AI thing might blow over (h=
aha did you really think I would say that on this newsletter lol).
I can't do that.
The truth? Most brands are already zombies. They just don't know it yet. Th=
ey're dead companies walking, optimizing for a game that ended two years ag=
o. Still tracking rankings while their customers get answers from Claude. S=
till building backlinks while their market share evaporates into the latent=
 space.
Want to know if you're already dead? Ask ChatGPT about your category withou=
t mentioning your company. If you don't appear in the top three suggestions=
, you're a zombie. Your traffic might look fine today=E2=80=94zombies can s=
hamble along for years. But you're invisible to the future.
Here's what's really going to bake your noodle: The parameter lock-in effec=
t. Every time a model retrains, strong signals get stronger. Weak signals d=
on't just stay weak=E2=80=94they disappear. It's winner-take-all physics. S=
alesforce doesn't just have brand recognition; it has parameter gravity. Ev=
ery mention reinforces its position. Every training cycle deepens its moat.
Sidebar: How Parameter Lock-In Works
Here's an explanation of that concept:
The idea is that in machine learning, especially with large models, the "pa=
rameters" (which are weights and biases in the neural network) represent th=
e knowledge the model has learned. These parameters don't continuously upda=
te once the model is deployed. Instead, each new version of the model build=
s on what came before=E2=80=94it incorporates the previously learned parame=
ters as a foundation and refines or expands on them through further trainin=
g.
This means your "brand" or the model=E2=80=99s identity becomes increasingl=
y fixed over time because it=E2=80=99s based on these parameters that have =
been carefully tuned through repeated training and reinforcement (like Rein=
forcement Learning, RL). As training advances, the model=E2=80=99s paramete=
rs start to "lock in," because the system has settled into certain knowledg=
e patterns and capabilities shaped by prior learning.
Applying this as an analogy to competition and strategy: if you delay start=
ing the training or development of your model, your competitors are not idl=
e=E2=80=94they're actively training and improving their models daily. Over =
time, their models' parameters become stronger and more specialized, reinfo=
rcing their positions. So by the time you start, the technical and strategi=
c "ground" they occupy is more settled ("parameters locked in"), making it =
harder for you to catch up=E2=80=94the physics (the underlying complexity a=
nd constraints) of the problem get tougher to overcome.
In other words:
Models don=E2=80=99t endlessly update once trained; they build on previousl=
y learned parameters.
These parameters shape the model=E2=80=99s knowledge and capabilities, =E2=
=80=9Clocking in=E2=80=9D expertise over time.
Delaying start means others=E2=80=99 parameters are already solidified, mak=
ing competition tougher.
The process is cumulative and somewhat path-dependent=E2=80=94early movemen=
t confers strategic advantage.
Does that help clarify?
Don=E2=80=99t be Invisible
You know what's worse than being invisible? Being frozen in amber. That out=
dated description from 2019? That's your permanent identity. That competito=
r comparison where you lost? That's your eternal position. That pricing fro=
m your Series A? That's what every AI quotes forever.
I give it 18 months. Maybe 24 if we're lucky. That's your window before pos=
itions solidify into permanent parameters. Before the cost of displacing an=
 incumbent becomes astronomical. Before "we should do something about AI" b=
ecomes "we should have done something about AI."
The consolidation will be brutal. In every category, I=E2=80=99m betting th=
at 3-5 brands will achieve permanent parameter status. Everyone else become=
s background noise. The long tail doesn't exist in AI responses. There's no=
 page two to optimize for. You're either in the consideration set or you're=
 nowhere.
Think about what this means. Your TAM isn't shrinking=E2=80=94your addressa=
ble market is. Every day, more of your potential customers get their vendor=
 shortlist from AI. And every day you're not on that shortlist, you're trai=
ning the machines to ignore you.
Some companies get this. They're restructuring everything. Treating LLMs as=
 their primary audience. Building citation strategies like their revenue de=
pends on it=E2=80=94because it does. They're not optimizing for search; the=
y're optimizing for memory. Not rankings but parameters. Not traffic but tr=
aining data.
The rest? They're having meetings about meetings about AI strategy. They're=
 forming committees. They're waiting for best practices to emerge. (Hello, =
some of us are writing them over here.) They're watching their relevance ev=
aporate in real-time while debating whether this matters.
Evolution doesn't care about your quarterly targets. It doesn't care about =
your existing SEO investment. It doesn't care that you just hired a VP of C=
ontent. The environment changed. Adapt or die.
But here's the thing=E2=80=94and maybe this is the reassurance you need=E2=
=80=94the playbook exists. The moves are known. The early movers are provin=
g it works. This isn't theoretical. Companies executing these strategies ar=
e seeing traffic lift while their competitors erode.
You have two choices:
Accept that the game changed and change with it. Become a parameter. Build =
for machines. Create moats AI can't cross. It's hard, it's different, and i=
t's necessary.
Or keep playing the old game. Keep chasing rankings that don't matter for t=
raffic that won't come from humans who aren't searching. Become a cautionar=
y tale at marketing conferences. "Remember when Acme had 30% market share?"
The future isn't uncomfortable because it's uncertain. It's uncomfortable b=
ecause it's certain. AI will intermediate every high-value discovery moment=
=2E Every vendor evaluation. Every purc=
hase decision. The only question is wh=
ether you'll be in the response.
Your SEO playbook is obsolete. Your content strategy is a relic. Your brand=
 is either becoming a parameter or becoming irrelevant.
The window is open. The physics still allows change. The playbook is in you=
r hands.
Your move.
Time to make it.

5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Let me blow your mind for a second. =
When ChatGPT talks about your company, it's not googling you. It's not chec=
king your website. It's accessing memories=E2=80=94weighted connections in =
a neural network that were frozen months or years ago. Your brand isn't a U=
RL anymore. It's a parameter.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think of it like this: Inside=
 GPT-4, there's a vast multidimensional space where concepts live. Not word=
s=E2=80=94concepts. Your brand is either a distinct point in that space or =
it's noise. There's no middle ground. No page two. No &quot;work your way u=
p the rankings.&quot; You exist in the model's understanding of your indust=
ry, or you're invisible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn't how we're trained to th=
ink about discovery. We're used to the Google paradigm=E2=80=94you can alwa=
ys climb from page three to page one with enough effort. But in AI? If you'=
re not in the training data, you're dead. If you're in the training data bu=
t inconsistently described, you're background radiation. Only the clearest,=
 most repeated signals become parameters the model can reliably access.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Here's where it gets wild. Those parameters are fighting for s=
pace. When someone asks about &quot;enterprise CRM,&quot; the model has may=
be 50-100 strongly weighted options in its latent space. Salesforce is prob=
ably a massive cluster. HubSpot has its own gravity well. But your revoluti=
onary CRM startup? Unless you achieved parameter status during training, yo=
u don't exist in that query's possibility space.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=

 you say &quot;but Nate, can't the AI search the web in real-time?&quot;=E2=
=80=94sure, sometimes. But real-time retrieval is expensive, slow, and unre=
liable. Models default to their baked-in knowledge. By the time an AI decid=
es to search the web, it's already formed an opinion about who the players =
are. You're fighting uphill against pre-existing parameters.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">The technical reality is brutal: Language models compress the entire inte=
rnet into weights and biases. During that compression, weak signals disappe=
ar. Inconsistent signals cancel out. Only the strongest, most consistent pa=

 yet. They're dead companies walking, optimizing for a game that ended two =
years ago. Still tracking rankings while their customers get answers from C=

atGPT about your category without mentioning your company. If you don't app=

Lock-In Works</strong></h4><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's an explanation of that conce=
pt:</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">The idea is that in machine learning, especially with l=
arge models, the &quot;parameters&quot; (which are weights and biases in th=
e neural network) represent the knowledge the model has learned. These para=
meters don't continuously update once the model is deployed. Instead, each =
new version of the model builds on what came before=E2=80=94it incorporates=
 the previously learned parameters as a foundation and refines or expands o=
n them through further training.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This means your &quot;bran=
d&quot; or the model=E2=80=99s identity becomes increasingly fixed over tim=
e because it=E2=80=99s based on these parameters that have been carefully t=
uned through repeated training and reinforcement (like Reinforcement Learni=
ng, RL). As training advances, the model=E2=80=99s parameters start to &quo=
t;lock in,&quot; because the system has settled into certain knowledge patt=
erns and capabilities shaped by prior learning.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Applying th=
is as an analogy to competition and strategy: if you delay starting the tra=
ining or development of your model, your competitors are not idle=E2=80=94t=
hey're actively training and improving their models daily. Over time, their=
 models' parameters become stronger and more specialized, reinforcing their=
 positions. So by the time you start, the technical and strategic &quot;gro=
und&quot; they occupy is more settled (&quot;parameters locked in&quot;), m=
aking it harder for you to catch up=E2=80=94the physics (the underlying com=
plexity and constraints) of the problem get tougher to overcome.</p><p styl=

p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=

is the reassurance you need=E2=80=94the playbook exists. The moves are know=

.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
