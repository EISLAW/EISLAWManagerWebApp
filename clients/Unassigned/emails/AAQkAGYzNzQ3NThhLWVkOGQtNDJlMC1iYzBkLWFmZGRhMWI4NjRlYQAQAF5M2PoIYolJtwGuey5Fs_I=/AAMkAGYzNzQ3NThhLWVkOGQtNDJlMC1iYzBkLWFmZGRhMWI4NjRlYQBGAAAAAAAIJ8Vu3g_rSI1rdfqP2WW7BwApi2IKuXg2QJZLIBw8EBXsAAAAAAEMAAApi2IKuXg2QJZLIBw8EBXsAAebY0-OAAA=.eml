A podcast in Silicon Valley blew up the world in the last couple of days.
AI legend Andrej Karpathy joined the most famous podcast [ https://substack=
=2Ecom/redirect/331874b6-ad41-44ea-895=
4-b140c58b0819?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.=
zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] in the Valley for a no-holds-=
barred 2.5 hour conversation on the future of AI.=20
I think most people skipped the episode, but nobody missed the screaming he=
adlines after. The news was filled with breathless claims that the AI bubbl=
e had been popped, that Andrej thought AI agents were =E2=80=98slop=E2=80=
=99 and that the AI hype cycle was over.
That=E2=80=99s a lot of power for one podcast!=20
So why the firestorm? I dug into both the podcast, the reaction, and Andrej=
=E2=80=99s clarification after [ https://substack.com/redirect/9e34a83f-d2b=
d-4738-9f9f-ee6d1838c97f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. I think the headlines are wrong, but I think that=E2=
=80=99s beside the point.
The real story is how well-aligned Andrej=E2=80=99s story is to the world I=
=E2=80=99ve been living and wrestling with every day on this blog: how do w=
e build interesting production AI agents that do real and useful work? What=
 does that actually look like?
Since the podcast, I=E2=80=99ve had people reach out to me, asking if they =
should stop building agents. Asking if things are overhyped and they should=
 pull back.=20
And that=E2=80=99s frustrating, because if listen to Andrej, that=E2=80=99s=
 not the message he sends.
And if you read this blog, you know I call out over and over again the real=
 returns people and teams get from investing in useful agents today.
So I got inspired, and I decided to put together a guide to building with t=
he agents we have today that reflects both my experience and the notes / in=
sights Andrej had on the podcast.=20
I really went all in:
Three in-depth prompts on agent design:
Conversational Agent Design Prompt: End-to-end architecture interview cover=
ing memory, reliability, economics, tools, testing, and governance with for=
ced trade-off decisions.
Conversational Memory Blueprint: Deep-dive on what your agent remembers and=
 forgets across working, episodic, and semantic memory with explicit storag=
e and update patterns.
Conversational Production Ops Runbook: Prototype-to-production transformati=
on with monitoring, SLOs, alerting, incident response, and operational disc=
ipline.
Plus the principles that align with Andrej=E2=80=99s insights:
Why memory architecture beats models
How architecture creates agent reliability
Test outcomes, not agent steps
Model economics before writing code
Start with boring, expensive problems
Follow cost, ignore the hype
Use patterns that actually work
Avoid these predictable failure modes
Run production with operational discipline
Build patterns that compound value
I went deep on this one, because I want you to have both a realistic take o=
n the podcast and also a really hands-on perspective on agent-building from=
 someone who=E2=80=99s in it today.=20
So watch the video for my take on Andrej, dig into the principles below for=
 how to build, and jump into those prompts to start building for yourself!
Good luck, and don=E2=80=99t panic :)
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Grab the prompts on conversational agent design [ https://substack.com/redi=
rect/4da64292-c3da-4ec9-8a32-8a73ccc04834?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFx=
PmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These three prompts work together as a complete design-to-production system=
 for building agents that actually ship.=20
The Conversational Agent Design Prompt handles the overall architecture=E2=
=80=94walking you through memory, reliability, economics, tools, and testin=
g in a structured interview that surfaces constraints and forces decisions.=
=20
The Conversational Memory Blueprint zooms in on the hardest architectural p=
roblem, helping you map exactly what your agent needs to remember, where th=
at memory lives, and how it updates across working, episodic, and semantic =
layers.=20
The Conversational Production Ops Runbook takes your prototype and turns it=
 into a monitored, cost-controlled service with real SLOs, alerting, incide=
nt response, and change management.=20
Each prompt uses the same question-first interview style=E2=80=94asking wha=
t matters, reflecting understanding back, offering 2-3 options with clear t=
rade-offs, then ending with crisp decisions and next actions. They=E2=80=99=
re designed to move you from idea to production systematically, forcing you=
 to answer the hard questions before they become production incidents. Use =
them in sequence or jump to whichever matches where you=E2=80=99re stuck.
Building Agents That Actually Work
Andrej Karpathy=E2=80=99s recent podcast sparked a small controversy when h=
e said =E2=80=9Cuseful agents are a decade away.=E2=80=9D The reaction was =
predictable=E2=80=94people heard what they wanted to hear and missed his ac=
tual point. He wasn=E2=80=99t saying agents are useless. He was saying that=
 fully autonomous, reliable, self-learning agents that operate without guar=
drails are a decade away. And he=E2=80=99s right about that.
But here=E2=80=99s what matters more: agents that deliver tremendous value =
exist today. I=E2=80=99ve built them. I=E2=80=99ve seen companies save mill=
ions with them. The trick is architecting for the constraints we actually h=
ave, not the capabilities we wish for.
This isn=E2=80=99t about waiting for better models. It=E2=80=99s about unde=
rstanding what works now and building systems that get better as models imp=
rove. After shipping dozens of agent systems and watching most of them succ=
eed or fail in production, I=E2=80=99ve learned that success comes down to =
a handful of principles that most builders miss.
Memory Is Everything
Andrej identified memory as the core architectural problem for agents, and =
he=E2=80=99s absolutely correct. Without durable memory, agents can=E2=80=
=99t approximate human learning trajectories. They can=E2=80=99t improve fr=
om past mistakes. They can=E2=80=99t build on previous successes. The memor=
y problem underlies almost every other agent limitation.
But here=E2=80=99s where theory meets practice: memory isn=E2=80=99t a feat=
ure you bolt on after the fact. It=E2=80=99s an engineering discipline that=
 informs every architectural decision from the beginning. I=E2=80=99ve seen=
 too many teams treat memory as an afterthought, then wonder why their agen=
ts can=E2=80=99t learn or improve.
When I start designing an agent system, I force myself to answer specific q=
uestions about memory before writing any code. What memory does this agent =
actually need to function? The question sounds simple but demands precision=
=2E Are we talking about remembering to=
ol outputs from three turns ago? Learn=
ing from failed attempts across sessions? Maintaining domain knowledge that=
 evolves quarterly? Each type requires completely different infrastructure.
Memory splits into three distinct types, and understanding the difference d=
etermines whether your agent works or wastes tokens. Working memory lives i=
n the immediate context window and handles ephemeral task state. When you=
=E2=80=99re asking an agent to analyze a document and write a summary, work=
ing memory tracks the current analysis, references specific sections, and m=
aintains the draft summary. It exists only for the duration of that session=
=2E
Episodic memory persists across sessions and stores experiences that inform=
 future behavior. This is where agents learn from past failures and recogni=
ze patterns that span multiple interactions. When your agent encounters a p=
roblem it=E2=80=99s seen before, episodic memory lets it apply lessons lear=
ned last week or last month.
Semantic memory encodes domain knowledge and reference information. Product=
 catalogs, company policies, technical specifications=E2=80=94information t=
hat agents need but shouldn=E2=80=99t have to rediscover with every interac=
tion. This memory type changes slowly and deliberately as domain understand=
ing evolves.
Where each type lives determines everything about how it performs. Working =
memory operates within the model=E2=80=99s context window, typically spanni=
ng 2,000 to 200,000 tokens depending on which model you=E2=80=99ve selected=
=2E Access stays fast=E2=80=94under 1=
00 milliseconds=E2=80=94because you=E2=
=80=99re reading from in-memory structures. But it vanishes when the conver=
sation ends, which is exactly what you want.
Episodic memory moves into persistent storage, usually vector databases tha=
t enable semantic search across past experiences. Capacity becomes theoreti=
cally unlimited but practically cost-bounded. You=E2=80=99ll hit economic c=
onstraints before technical ones. Access latency jumps to somewhere between=
 10 and 500 milliseconds depending on index size and query complexity. Upda=
tes occur after significant events rather than every turn: completed tasks,=
 recognized failure patterns, successful problem-solving strategies.
Semantic memory lives in knowledge bases and structured data stores. Access=
 latency typically runs 50 to 200 milliseconds, faster than episodic memory=
 because you=E2=80=99re querying structured data rather than unstructured e=
xperience logs. Updates happen periodically=E2=80=94weekly, monthly, or qua=
rterly depending on how rapidly your domain knowledge evolves.
The temporal dimension completes the picture. Working memory resets between=
 sessions by design. Episodic memory grows indefinitely unless you implemen=
t explicit pruning strategies based on relevance decay or storage economics=
=2E Semantic memory requires versioning=
 and migration paths as understanding=20=
evolves. These aren=E2=80=99t implementation details to defer=E2=80=94they=
=E2=80=99re architectural constraints that shape everything built above the=
m.
I=E2=80=99ve learned this the hard way: design memory systems explicitly be=
fore building agent logic. Memory architecture determines agent capabilitie=
s more than model selection does. You can upgrade from GPT-4 to o1 and see =
marginal improvements if your memory architecture constrains what the agent=
 can learn and remember. Fix the memory architecture first, and even older =
models become significantly more capable because they can access and build =
upon past experience.
Reliability Comes From Architecture, Not Prompting
Andrej=E2=80=99s second major insight separates production-ready systems fr=
om research prototypes: agents lack inherent reliability. You cannot prompt=
 an LLM into reliability, no matter how carefully you craft instructions or=
 how many examples you provide. Current sophisticated multi-agent implement=
ations achieve robustness through architecture, not through agent capabilit=
ies themselves.
I see this confusion constantly. Builders write increasingly elaborate syst=
em prompts trying to make agents more reliable. They add examples. They add=
 reasoning steps. They add validation checks in natural language. None of i=
t works reliably because non-deterministic components require deterministic=
 containers. The architecture creates reliability boundaries around fundame=
ntally unreliable agents.
Constraining the solution space turns out to be the primary mechanism for p=
reventing runaway behavior. When I design an agent system, I define exact t=
ool sets with no ambiguity about what tools exist. If an agent tries to use=
 a tool that doesn=E2=80=99t exist, that should fail at the architecture le=
vel before the agent attempts the operation. Hallucinated tools are a failu=
re of architecture, not prompting.
I specify output formats rigorously using schema validation, not gentle sug=
gestions in prompts. I set hard iteration limits that kill loops before the=
y consume the token budget. The metaphor that clarifies this approach: I=E2=
=80=99m creating narrow hallways with locked doors, not open plazas where a=
gents can wander indefinitely.
The separation between planning and execution implements a critical safety =
boundary. I let agents gather information freely through read-only operatio=
ns. Query databases, fetch documents, analyze data=E2=80=94all fine. They c=
an plan multi-step processes using internal reasoning that doesn=E2=80=99t =
touch external state. But they commit to external actions deliberately, thr=
ough explicit write operations that cross architectural boundaries and trig=
ger validation.
I never conflate internal reasoning with external writes. The distinction s=
eems obvious when stated but gets blurred in implementation when developers=
 let agents chain operations without intermediate verification. I=E2=80=99v=
e debugged too many production incidents caused by agents that planned some=
thing reasonable but executed something catastrophic because no architectur=
al boundary existed between the two.
Validation happens at boundaries, not within agent logic. When an agent wan=
ts to write to a database, send an email, or modify a document, that reques=
t crosses an architectural boundary where deterministic validation occurs. =
Does this action match the expected schema? Does it fall within resource li=
mits? Does it target an allowed system? These checks happen in code, not in=
 prompts.
The human-in-the-loop pattern applies selectively based on action risk. Rea=
d operations proceed automatically. Low-risk writes with clear success crit=
eria and easy rollback proceed automatically. High-risk operations=E2=80=94=
those that are difficult to reverse or have significant consequences=E2=80=
=94require human approval. I design the approval interface to make decision=
s easy: show context, explain intent, make consequences clear.
Checkpointing and rollback capability separate production-ready systems fro=
m prototypes. Before any state-changing operation, I capture enough informa=
tion to reverse it. For database writes, I track what changed. For file mod=
ifications, I maintain previous versions. For external API calls, I log req=
uest parameters and responses. When agents make mistakes=E2=80=94and they w=
ill=E2=80=94I can roll back cleanly rather than leaving systems in inconsis=
tent states.
The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures. When an agent oper=
ation fails, I don=E2=80=99t let it retry indefinitely. After a configurabl=
e number of failures within a time window, the circuit opens and subsequent=
 attempts fail fast. This prevents a confused agent from hammering external=
 systems or consuming the token budget on operations that won=E2=80=99t suc=
ceed.
Monitoring and observability aren=E2=80=99t optional. I instrument every ag=
ent system with structured logging that captures decision points, tool invo=
cations, and reasoning steps. When something goes wrong=E2=80=94and underst=
anding why requires tracing back through the decision chain=E2=80=94good ob=
servability means the difference between quick diagnosis and multi-hour deb=
ugging sessions.
The Testing Challenge
Testing agents isn=E2=80=99t like testing traditional software, and pretend=
ing otherwise leads to false confidence. Deterministic inputs don=E2=80=99t=
 produce deterministic outputs. The same prompt with the same tools can yie=
ld different results because LLMs introduce inherent randomness.
I=E2=80=99ve developed testing strategies that work despite non-determinism=
=2E The first principle: test outcomes=
, not implementation details. I don=E2=
=80=99t care if an agent uses tool A then tool B or tool B then tool A, as =
long as it produces the correct result. This shifts testing from =E2=80=9Cd=
id the agent follow these exact steps=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cdid the agent ac=
hieve the goal with acceptable resource consumption?=E2=80=9D
For well-defined tasks with clear success criteria, I create evaluation dat=
asets with input-output pairs. Process this invoice, extract these fields, =
classify this document. The evaluation checks whether the agent produced th=
e correct output, regardless of how it got there. I run these evaluations r=
epeatedly=E2=80=94at least 10 times per test case=E2=80=94to catch failures=
 that occur probabilistically.
For tasks without clear correct answers, I use model-based evaluation. A se=
parate LLM judges whether the agent=E2=80=99s output satisfies quality crit=
eria. This approach works surprisingly well for summarization, content gene=
ration, and analysis tasks where multiple valid outputs exist but quality r=
emains assessable.
I maintain a growing library of edge cases discovered in production. Every =
failure that reaches production becomes a test case. This library compounds=
 in value because it captures the weird, unexpected scenarios that initial =
testing misses. Over time, the edge case library becomes more valuable than=
 the happy path tests.
The escalation path matters as much as the test results. When an agent enco=
unters a scenario it can=E2=80=99t handle, what happens? I design explicit =
escalation: flag uncertainty, explain what failed, provide context for huma=
n intervention. An agent that knows its limits and escalates appropriately =
is more valuable than an agent that appears confident while producing garba=
ge.
Economics Determine Viability
Token consumption patterns determine whether agent approaches remain econom=
ically viable at scale. I=E2=80=99ve seen brilliant technical implementatio=
ns fail because nobody calculated the actual cost per transaction until pro=
duction invoices arrived.
Before building any agent system, I model the economics explicitly. What=E2=
=80=99s the token consumption pattern for typical tasks? How does that tran=
slate to dollars per successful outcome? What=E2=80=99s the alternative cos=
t=E2=80=94human time, existing automation, or doing nothing? The agent appr=
oach must deliver better economics than alternatives, not just better techn=
ology.
Intelligent routing by task complexity optimizes costs dramatically. Simple=
 tasks use smaller, cheaper models. Complex tasks use larger, more capable =
models. The routing decision happens before the agent starts working, based=
 on task characteristics that predict required reasoning depth. I=E2=80=99v=
e seen this approach reduce costs by 60% while maintaining quality.
The cost structure changes as you scale. Initial deployments handle dozens =
or hundreds of tasks daily. At that volume, model costs dominate and infras=
tructure costs round to zero. But scale to thousands or tens of thousands o=
f daily tasks and infrastructure costs=E2=80=94vector databases, orchestrat=
ion, monitoring=E2=80=94start mattering. I model both curves before buildin=
g because the optimal architecture differs based on expected scale.
Caching strategies reduce redundant computation. When multiple tasks requir=
e the same information retrieval or analysis, I cache results and reuse the=
m. The caching layer needs careful design because naive caching can serve s=
tale results, but intelligent caching reduces token consumption significant=
ly.
The measurement discipline separates successful from failed projects. I def=
ine success metrics before deployment, not after. I measure actual cost sav=
ings or revenue impact, not proxy metrics like =E2=80=9Cuser satisfaction=
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ctask completion.=E2=80=9D I track adoption rates=E2=
=80=94if users avoid the agent, it=E2=80=99s not delivering value regardles=
s of technical capability. I monitor failure patterns to distinguish transi=
ent issues from systematic problems.
I set kill criteria upfront: if we don=E2=80=99t see X improvement in Y tim=
eframe, we stop. This discipline prevents zombie projects that consume reso=
urces without delivering returns.
Start Simple, Scale Deliberately
The biggest mistake I see builders make is starting too complex. They desig=
n elaborate multi-agent systems with sophisticated reasoning capabilities f=
or problems that need simple automation. The complexity becomes the project=
 instead of the value delivered.
I=E2=80=99ve learned to start with the simplest architecture that could pos=
sibly work. Single-purpose agents with narrow, well-defined scope. Clear su=
ccess criteria that eliminate ambiguity about whether the agent worked. Con=
tained failure modes that prevent individual failures from creating system-=
wide problems.
Document processing provides a perfect starting point. Extract information =
from invoices, contracts, or forms. The task is well-defined, the success c=
riteria are clear, and the failure mode is contained=E2=80=94if extraction =
fails, a human can review it. ROI measurement stays straightforward: FTE ti=
me saved, multiplied by loaded cost, compared to agent implementation and o=
perating costs.
Data entry and triage systems offer similar characteristics. Take informati=
on from one system, transform it according to rules, and write it to anothe=
r system. Or categorize incoming requests and route them to appropriate han=
dlers. These tasks are boring, repetitive, and expensive when done by human=
s. Perfect agent territory.
The pattern I follow: deploy a simple agent, monitor it closely, let it han=
dle increasing volume as confidence grows, then identify the next problem t=
o tackle. Each deployment teaches lessons about what works, what fails, and=
 where constraints actually bind. This experience compounds=E2=80=94I devel=
op intuition about which problems will work and which won=E2=80=99t.
As models improve, the same architectural patterns don=E2=80=99t become obs=
olete=E2=80=94they become more valuable. The memory systems I build today w=
ill extract more learning from better models tomorrow. The containment stra=
tegies prevent new failure modes that more capable models introduce. The to=
ol interfaces give improved models more leverage.
The Three Tiers of Agent Capability
I think about agent capabilities in three tiers, and understanding which ti=
er your problem occupies determines whether you should build it today or wa=
it.
Tier 1 represents point solutions deployable today with current technology.=
 Single-purpose agents with narrow, well-defined scope deliver measurable v=
alue without introducing massive complexity. Clear success criteria elimina=
te ambiguity. Contained failure modes prevent individual failures from crea=
ting system-wide problems. Document processing, data entry, triage systems=
=E2=80=94all Tier 1. ROI measurement stays straightforward: time saved vers=
us cost of implementation and operation.
Most builders should focus here because the value is accessible and the ris=
k is manageable. I=E2=80=99ve seen companies save millions annually with Ti=
er 1 agents despite their limitations. The problems are boring, which makes=
 them perfect=E2=80=94nobody wants to do these tasks manually, and automati=
on value is obvious.
Tier 2 encompasses workflow agents emerging over the next 2-3 years as mode=
ls improve. Multi-step processes with decision points require agents to mai=
ntain context across steps and make judgment calls based on intermediate re=
sults. Learning from outcomes within sessions lets agents improve their app=
roach during extended interactions. Cross-system orchestration coordinates =
multiple tools and data sources to accomplish complex tasks.
ROI shifts from pure time savings to process efficiency improvements=E2=80=
=94tasks that couldn=E2=80=99t be automated previously become automatable. =
The technical bar rises significantly because coordination complexity compo=
unds. I=E2=80=99m starting to build Tier 2 systems now, but they require mo=
re sophisticated architecture and more careful risk management than Tier 1.
Tier 3 describes autonomous agents genuinely arriving in 5-10 years, not to=
morrow. Self-directed goal pursuit means agents set their own subgoals base=
d on high-level objectives. Persistent learning and memory allow agents to =
improve continuously across sessions without human intervention. Minimal hu=
man oversight becomes possible because agents reliably handle edge cases an=
d unexpected situations.
ROI enters new territory: capabilities that were previously impossible at a=
ny cost become economically feasible. This tier requires breakthroughs in m=
emory, robustness, and reliability that don=E2=80=99t exist yet. Andrej was=
 talking about Tier 3 agents when he said =E2=80=9Ca decade away,=E2=80=9D =
and he=E2=80=99s right.
Most builders overestimate what Tier 3 will look like=E2=80=94imagining cap=
abilities that remain science fiction=E2=80=94and underestimate the value a=
vailable in Tier 1 today. The opportunity isn=E2=80=99t waiting for Tier 3.=
 It=E2=80=99s building excellent Tier 1 systems today that naturally evolve=
 into Tier 2 as models improve.
Follow the Cost, Not the Hype
The most successful agent implementations I=E2=80=99ve seen solve problems =
that are expensive and boring, not problems that are exciting and cheap. Cu=
stomer support triage saves millions annually because humans are expensive =
and the volume is enormous. Document processing eliminates entire FTE posit=
ions because manual review is slow and error-prone. Data entry and validati=
on prevent costly mistakes while freeing humans for higher-value work.
When I evaluate whether to build an agent, I calculate the fully-loaded cos=
t of the manual process. Not just salary=E2=80=94benefits, management overh=
ead, training, turnover, errors. Then I estimate agent costs including deve=
lopment, operation, and failures. If the agent delivers 3x ROI within six m=
onths, I build it. If not, I wait for models to improve or find a different=
 problem.
The volume question matters tremendously. Agents aren=E2=80=99t justified f=
or tasks that occur weekly. They=E2=80=99re justified when the task happens=
 hundreds or thousands of times, when the manual cost adds up, when the bor=
ing repetition drives people to distraction. Find the expensive, boring, hi=
gh-volume problems and you=E2=80=99ll find where agents deliver immediate v=
alue.
I watch for what I call =E2=80=9Ccost concentration=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94scenar=
ios where small improvements in efficiency translate to large cost reductio=
ns. A 20% improvement in customer support triage might eliminate the need f=
or two support team members. A 30% improvement in document processing might=
 let you cancel a vendor contract. These concentrated value opportunities j=
ustify higher development costs because the return is substantial and immed=
iate.
The competitive analysis includes doing nothing. Sometimes the right answer=
 is to live with the manual process because automation costs exceed benefit=
s. I=E2=80=99d rather deploy no solution than deploy an agent that costs mo=
re to operate than the problem it solves. This discipline keeps me focused =
on real value rather than technical elegance.
The Patterns That Actually Work
After building dozens of agent systems, certain patterns emerge as consiste=
ntly effective while others consistently fail. The successful patterns shar=
e common characteristics: they constrain agent behavior, they make failures=
 visible and recoverable, and they align economic incentives with desired o=
utcomes.
The state machine pattern constrains agent behavior by defining explicit st=
ates and valid transitions. The agent can be in state A, B, or C, and can t=
ransition from A to B but not from A to C. This prevents the agent from wan=
dering into unexpected states and makes reasoning about system behavior tra=
ctable. I use state machines for multi-step workflows where order matters a=
nd certain operations must complete before others begin.
The approval queue pattern handles operations that require human judgment. =
High-risk actions don=E2=80=99t execute immediately=E2=80=94they enter a qu=
eue where humans review context and make decisions. The queue interface sho=
ws enough information to make good decisions quickly: what the agent wants =
to do, why, what the consequences are, what the rollback plan is. This patt=
ern lets me deploy agents in domains where full automation would be risky.
The confidence scoring pattern makes agent uncertainty explicit. When the a=
gent performs classification or makes recommendations, it reports a confide=
nce score alongside the result. Low-confidence results get flagged for huma=
n review while high-confidence results proceed automatically. Over time, I =
adjust the confidence threshold based on observed accuracy=E2=80=94if high-=
confidence results prove reliable, I raise the automation threshold.
The tool result caching pattern reduces redundant computation. When the age=
nt retrieves information or performs analysis, I cache the result with appr=
opriate TTL. Subsequent tasks that need the same information reuse cached r=
esults rather than consuming additional tokens. This pattern requires caref=
ul thinking about cache invalidation, but the token savings justify the com=
plexity.
The parallel execution pattern handles tasks that don=E2=80=99t depend on e=
ach other. Instead of processing sequentially, I dispatch multiple agents i=
n parallel and aggregate results. This pattern dramatically reduces end-to-=
end latency for batch operations and improves resource utilization. The agg=
regation step requires careful design to handle partial failures gracefully=
=2E
The Failure Patterns to Avoid
I=E2=80=99ve also seen consistent failure patterns that builders should avo=
id. These patterns look reasonable during design but fail predictably in pr=
oduction.
The unconstrained reasoning loop is the classic failure. The agent tries ap=
proach A, which fails. It tries approach B, which also fails. It keeps tryi=
ng variations until it exhausts the token budget or hits an iteration limit=
=2E The problem: it=E2=80=99s not learning=
 from failures, just burning tokens=
=2E I prevent this by setting hard limi=
ts and requiring explicit escalation a=
fter a small number of failures.
The implicit state problem occurs when agents assume state that isn=E2=80=
=99t explicitly tracked. The agent remembers something from earlier in the =
conversation and acts on that memory, but the memory isn=E2=80=99t persiste=
d anywhere. When the session ends, that state vanishes. Next time, the agen=
t has to rediscover everything. I fix this by making all persistent state e=
xplicit and storing it deliberately.
The permission confusion problem happens when agents have access to tools t=
hey shouldn=E2=80=99t use for particular tasks. The agent can technically c=
all any tool in its repertoire, but some tools are inappropriate for specif=
ic scenarios. Without explicit permission management, agents occasionally i=
nvoke wrong tools with bad consequences. I solve this by defining tool avai=
lability per task type rather than per agent.
The error propagation problem occurs when agents treat errors as facts. Ext=
ernal API calls fail, the agent receives an error message, and then incorpo=
rates that error into its reasoning as if it=E2=80=99s valid data. I preven=
t this by making error handling explicit at architectural boundaries and ne=
ver letting raw errors propagate to agent context.
The cost explosion problem hits when agents use expensive models for simple=
 tasks or invoke expensive tools unnecessarily. Without explicit cost aware=
ness and routing logic, agents default to maximum-capability approaches for=
 all problems. I fix this by routing tasks to appropriately-sized models an=
d making agents aware of tool costs.
Building for Production
The gap between prototype and production is enormous. Prototypes demonstrat=
e possibility. Production systems deliver reliability. The difference is ar=
chitectural discipline applied consistently.
Production systems need comprehensive logging that captures every decision,=
 tool invocation, and outcome. When something goes wrong three days after d=
eployment, I need to reconstruct exactly what the agent was thinking. Struc=
tured logs with consistent schemas make this possible. I capture input stat=
e, reasoning steps, tool calls with parameters and responses, confidence sc=
ores, and final outputs.
Production systems need monitoring that detects degradation before users co=
mplain. I track success rates, failure rates, latency distributions, token =
consumption, and cost per outcome. I set alerts based on deviations from no=
rmal patterns rather than absolute thresholds. If success rate drops 10% in=
 an hour, I want to know immediately even if the absolute rate remains acce=
ptable.
Production systems need graceful degradation when dependencies fail. If the=
 vector database is slow, can we fall back to keyword search? If the knowle=
dge base is unavailable, can we proceed with reduced capability? I design f=
allback paths that maintain partial functionality rather than complete fail=
ure.
Production systems need deployment discipline. I never deploy directly to p=
roduction. I test in staging with production-equivalent data and load. I de=
ploy incrementally=E2=80=94a small percentage of traffic first, then gradua=
lly increase as confidence grows. I maintain the ability to roll back quick=
ly if problems emerge.
Production systems need clear ownership and operational responsibility. Som=
eone wakes up when the system fails. Someone reviews logs and metrics regul=
arly. Someone makes decisions about when to intervene versus when to let th=
e system self-correct. This operational discipline makes the difference bet=
ween systems that stay healthy and systems that slowly degrade.
The Next Two Years
Models are improving rapidly. The capabilities I struggled to coax from GPT=
-4 last year emerge naturally from today=E2=80=99s models. This trajectory =
continues and accelerates. The question for builders isn=E2=80=99t whether =
agents will become more capable=E2=80=94they will=E2=80=94but how to build =
systems today that benefit from tomorrow=E2=80=99s improvements.
The architectural patterns I develop now compound in value. Memory systems =
designed for today=E2=80=99s limitations will work better with tomorrow=E2=
=80=99s models. Tool interfaces created for current capabilities will give =
improved models more leverage. Containment strategies that prevent today=E2=
=80=99s failure modes will prevent the new failure modes that more capable =
models introduce.
I=E2=80=99m building for a future where models handle more complex reasonin=
g, maintain longer-term context, and exhibit fewer failure modes. But I=E2=
=80=99m not waiting for that future to deliver value. The agents we have to=
day are capable enough to solve expensive problems when properly architecte=
d.
The builders who win this decade aren=E2=80=99t waiting for perfect agents.=
 They=E2=80=99re building with imperfect agents today, developing architect=
ural patterns that scale with model improvements, and delivering ROI that j=
ustifies continued investment. Each production deployment teaches lessons a=
bout what works, what fails, and where constraints actually bind.
This experience compounds. Early builders develop intuition that latecomers=
 will lack. They understand which problems yield to current capabilities an=
d which require future breakthroughs. They recognize failure patterns befor=
e they manifest. They architect systems that benefit from model improvement=
s without requiring rewrites.
What This Means for You
If you=E2=80=99re building agents today, focus on Tier 1 problems. Find exp=
ensive, boring, high-volume work that nobody wants to do manually. Design e=
xplicit memory architecture before writing agent logic. Constrain behavior =
through architecture rather than prompting. Test outcomes rather than imple=
mentations. Model economics carefully. Deploy incrementally. Monitor obsess=
ively.
If you=E2=80=99re evaluating whether to build agents, calculate the fully-l=
oaded cost of manual processes and compare to agent costs including failure=
s. Look for cost concentration where small improvements yield large savings=
=2E Start with narrow scope and clear s=
uccess criteria. Plan for the capabili=
ty you have, not the capability you wish for.
If you=E2=80=99re waiting for better models, you=E2=80=99re leaving value o=
n the table. The agents we have today deliver tremendous ROI when properly =
architected. The patterns you develop now will compound as models improve. =
The experience you gain will separate you from builders who waited.
The decade of agents begins not with perfect technology but with discipline=
d builders who understand how to extract value from imperfect tools. The op=
portunity is enormous precisely because the gap between current capabilitie=
s and ultimate requirements creates space for people who know how to bridge=
 it.
Build with the agents we have. Focus on problems that matter. Use patterns =
that scale. The time is now.

 today. I=E2=80=99ve built them. I=E2=80=99ve seen companies save millions =

not the capabilities we wish for.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =

px;">Andrej identified memory as the core architectural problem for agents,=
 and he=E2=80=99s absolutely correct. Without durable memory, agents can=E2=
=80=99t approximate human learning trajectories. They can=E2=80=99t improve=
 from past mistakes. They can=E2=80=99t build on previous successes. The me=
mory problem underlies almost every other agent limitation.</p><p style=3D"=

>But here=E2=80=99s where theory meets practice: memory isn=E2=80=99t a fea=
ture you bolt on after the fact. It=E2=80=99s an engineering discipline tha=
t informs every architectural decision from the beginning. I=E2=80=99ve see=
n too many teams treat memory as an afterthought, then wonder why their age=
nts can=E2=80=99t learn or improve.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=
: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When I start designing =
an agent system, I force myself to answer specific questions about memory b=
efore writing any code. What memory does this agent actually need to functi=
on? The question sounds simple but demands precision. Are we talking about =
remembering tool outputs from three turns ago? Learning from failed attempt=
s across sessions? Maintaining domain knowledge that evolves quarterly? Eac=
h type requires completely different infrastructure.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Memory=
 splits into three distinct types, and understanding the difference determi=
nes whether your agent works or wastes tokens. Working memory lives in the =
immediate context window and handles ephemeral task state. When you=E2=80=
=99re asking an agent to analyze a document and write a summary, working me=
mory tracks the current analysis, references specific sections, and maintai=
ns the draft summary. It exists only for the duration of that session.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">Episodic memory persists across sessions and stores experiences=
 that inform future behavior. This is where agents learn from past failures=
 and recognize patterns that span multiple interactions. When your agent en=
counters a problem it=E2=80=99s seen before, episodic memory lets it apply =
lessons learned last week or last month.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Semantic memory en=
codes domain knowledge and reference information. Product catalogs, company=
 policies, technical specifications=E2=80=94information that agents need bu=
t shouldn=E2=80=99t have to rediscover with every interaction. This memory =
type changes slowly and deliberately as domain understanding evolves.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">Where each type lives determines everything about how it perform=
s. Working memory operates within the model=E2=80=99s context window, typic=
ally spanning 2,000 to 200,000 tokens depending on which model you=E2=80=99=
ve selected. Access stays fast=E2=80=94under 100 milliseconds=E2=80=94becau=
se you=E2=80=99re reading from in-memory structures. But it vanishes when t=
he conversation ends, which is exactly what you want.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Episo=
dic memory moves into persistent storage, usually vector databases that ena=
ble semantic search across past experiences. Capacity becomes theoretically=
 unlimited but practically cost-bounded. You=E2=80=99ll hit economic constr=
aints before technical ones. Access latency jumps to somewhere between 10 a=
nd 500 milliseconds depending on index size and query complexity. Updates o=
ccur after significant events rather than every turn: completed tasks, reco=
gnized failure patterns, successful problem-solving strategies.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Semantic memory lives in knowledge bases and structured data stores. A=
ccess latency typically runs 50 to 200 milliseconds, faster than episodic m=
emory because you=E2=80=99re querying structured data rather than unstructu=
red experience logs. Updates happen periodically=E2=80=94weekly, monthly, o=
r quarterly depending on how rapidly your domain knowledge evolves.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">The temporal dimension completes the picture. Working memory reset=
s between sessions by design. Episodic memory grows indefinitely unless you=
 implement explicit pruning strategies based on relevance decay or storage =
economics. Semantic memory requires versioning and migration paths as under=
standing evolves. These aren=E2=80=99t implementation details to defer=E2=
=80=94they=E2=80=99re architectural constraints that shape everything built=
 above them.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=E2=80=99ve learned this the hard way: design=
 memory systems explicitly before building agent logic. Memory architecture=
 determines agent capabilities more than model selection does. You can upgr=
ade from GPT-4 to o1 and see marginal improvements if your memory architect=
ure constrains what the agent can learn and remember. Fix the memory archit=
ecture first, and even older models become significantly more capable becau=
se they can access and build upon past experience.</p><h2 class=3D"header-a=

px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Andrej=E2=80=
=99s second major insight separates production-ready systems from research =
prototypes: agents lack inherent reliability. You cannot prompt an LLM into=
 reliability, no matter how carefully you craft instructions or how many ex=
amples you provide. Current sophisticated multi-agent implementations achie=
ve robustness through architecture, not through agent capabilities themselv=
es.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">I see this confusion constantly. Builders write increas=
ingly elaborate system prompts trying to make agents more reliable. They ad=
d examples. They add reasoning steps. They add validation checks in natural=
 language. None of it works reliably because non-deterministic components r=
equire deterministic containers. The architecture creates reliability bound=
aries around fundamentally unreliable agents.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Constraining =
the solution space turns out to be the primary mechanism for preventing run=
away behavior. When I design an agent system, I define exact tool sets with=
 no ambiguity about what tools exist. If an agent tries to use a tool that =
doesn=E2=80=99t exist, that should fail at the architecture level before th=
e agent attempts the operation. Hallucinated tools are a failure of archite=
cture, not prompting.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I specify output formats rigorously u=
sing schema validation, not gentle suggestions in prompts. I set hard itera=
tion limits that kill loops before they consume the token budget. The metap=
hor that clarifies this approach: I=E2=80=99m creating narrow hallways with=
 locked doors, not open plazas where agents can wander indefinitely.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">The separation between planning and execution implements a critic=
al safety boundary. I let agents gather information freely through read-onl=
y operations. Query databases, fetch documents, analyze data=E2=80=94all fi=
ne. They can plan multi-step processes using internal reasoning that doesn=
=E2=80=99t touch external state. But they commit to external actions delibe=
rately, through explicit write operations that cross architectural boundari=
es and trigger validation.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I never conflate internal reason=
ing with external writes. The distinction seems obvious when stated but get=
s blurred in implementation when developers let agents chain operations wit=
hout intermediate verification. I=E2=80=99ve debugged too many production i=
ncidents caused by agents that planned something reasonable but executed so=
mething catastrophic because no architectural boundary existed between the =
two.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">Validation happens at boundaries, not within agent log=
ic. When an agent wants to write to a database, send an email, or modify a =
document, that request crosses an architectural boundary where deterministi=
c validation occurs. Does this action match the expected schema? Does it fa=
ll within resource limits? Does it target an allowed system? These checks h=
appen in code, not in prompts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The human-in-the-loop patter=
n applies selectively based on action risk. Read operations proceed automat=
ically. Low-risk writes with clear success criteria and easy rollback proce=
ed automatically. High-risk operations=E2=80=94those that are difficult to =
reverse or have significant consequences=E2=80=94require human approval. I =
design the approval interface to make decisions easy: show context, explain=
 intent, make consequences clear.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Checkpointing and rollbac=
k capability separate production-ready systems from prototypes. Before any =
state-changing operation, I capture enough information to reverse it. For d=
atabase writes, I track what changed. For file modifications, I maintain pr=
evious versions. For external API calls, I log request parameters and respo=
nses. When agents make mistakes=E2=80=94and they will=E2=80=94I can roll ba=
ck cleanly rather than leaving systems in inconsistent states.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures. When an agent=
 operation fails, I don=E2=80=99t let it retry indefinitely. After a config=
urable number of failures within a time window, the circuit opens and subse=
quent attempts fail fast. This prevents a confused agent from hammering ext=
ernal systems or consuming the token budget on operations that won=E2=80=99=
t succeed.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

 decision points, tool invocations, and reasoning steps. When something goe=

s criteria, I create evaluation datasets with input-output pairs. Process t=
his invoice, extract these fields, classify this document. The evaluation c=
hecks whether the agent produced the correct output, regardless of how it g=
ot there. I run these evaluations repeatedly=E2=80=94at least 10 times per =

n. A separate LLM judges whether the agent=E2=80=99s output satisfies quali=

 weird, unexpected scenarios that initial testing misses. Over time, the ed=

</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">I think about agent capabilities in three tiers, and unde=
rstanding which tier your problem occupies determines whether you should bu=
ild it today or wait.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Tier 1 represents point solutions dep=
loyable today with current technology. Single-purpose agents with narrow, w=
ell-defined scope deliver measurable value without introducing massive comp=
lexity. Clear success criteria eliminate ambiguity. Contained failure modes=
 prevent individual failures from creating system-wide problems. Document p=
rocessing, data entry, triage systems=E2=80=94all Tier 1. ROI measurement s=
tays straightforward: time saved versus cost of implementation and operatio=
n.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Most builders should focus here because the value is acc=
essible and the risk is manageable. I=E2=80=99ve seen companies save millio=
ns annually with Tier 1 agents despite their limitations. The problems are =
boring, which makes them perfect=E2=80=94nobody wants to do these tasks man=
ually, and automation value is obvious.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Tier 2 encompasses =
workflow agents emerging over the next 2-3 years as models improve. Multi-s=
tep processes with decision points require agents to maintain context acros=
s steps and make judgment calls based on intermediate results. Learning fro=
m outcomes within sessions lets agents improve their approach during extend=
ed interactions. Cross-system orchestration coordinates multiple tools and =
data sources to accomplish complex tasks.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">ROI shifts from p=
ure time savings to process efficiency improvements=E2=80=94tasks that coul=
dn=E2=80=99t be automated previously become automatable. The technical bar =
rises significantly because coordination complexity compounds. I=E2=80=99m =
starting to build Tier 2 systems now, but they require more sophisticated a=
rchitecture and more careful risk management than Tier 1.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">T=
ier 3 describes autonomous agents genuinely arriving in 5-10 years, not tom=
orrow. Self-directed goal pursuit means agents set their own subgoals based=
 on high-level objectives. Persistent learning and memory allow agents to i=
mprove continuously across sessions without human intervention. Minimal hum=
an oversight becomes possible because agents reliably handle edge cases and=
 unexpected situations.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">ROI enters new territory: capabilit=
ies that were previously impossible at any cost become economically feasibl=
e. This tier requires breakthroughs in memory, robustness, and reliability =
that don=E2=80=99t exist yet. Andrej was talking about Tier 3 agents when h=
e said =E2=80=9Ca decade away,=E2=80=9D and he=E2=80=99s right.</p><p style=

lue available in Tier 1 today. The opportunity isn=E2=80=99t waiting for Ti=

 the Hype</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The most successful agent implementations I=E2=
=80=99ve seen solve problems that are expensive and boring, not problems th=
at are exciting and cheap. Customer support triage saves millions annually =
because humans are expensive and the volume is enormous. Document processin=
g eliminates entire FTE positions because manual review is slow and error-p=
rone. Data entry and validation prevent costly mistakes while freeing human=
s for higher-value work.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When I evaluate whether to build a=
n agent, I calculate the fully-loaded cost of the manual process. Not just =
salary=E2=80=94benefits, management overhead, training, turnover, errors. T=
hen I estimate agent costs including development, operation, and failures. =
If the agent delivers 3x ROI within six months, I build it. If not, I wait =
for models to improve or find a different problem.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The volu=
me question matters tremendously. Agents aren=E2=80=99t justified for tasks=
 that occur weekly. They=E2=80=99re justified when the task happens hundred=
s or thousands of times, when the manual cost adds up, when the boring repe=
tition drives people to distraction. Find the expensive, boring, high-volum=
e problems and you=E2=80=99ll find where agents deliver immediate value.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">I watch for what I call =E2=80=9Ccost concentration=E2=80=9D=
=E2=80=94scenarios where small improvements in efficiency translate to larg=
e cost reductions. A 20% improvement in customer support triage might elimi=
nate the need for two support team members. A 30% improvement in document p=
rocessing might let you cancel a vendor contract. These concentrated value =
opportunities justify higher development costs because the return is substa=
ntial and immediate.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The competitive analysis includes doin=
g nothing. Sometimes the right answer is to live with the manual process be=
cause automation costs exceed benefits. I=E2=80=99d rather deploy no soluti=
on than deploy an agent that costs more to operate than the problem it solv=
es. This discipline keeps me focused on real value rather than technical el=
egance.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;fon=

16em;font-size: 1.625em;">The Patterns That Actually Work</h2><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
After building dozens of agent systems, certain patterns emerge as consiste=
ntly effective while others consistently fail. The successful patterns shar=
e common characteristics: they constrain agent behavior, they make failures=
 visible and recoverable, and they align economic incentives with desired o=
utcomes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The state machine pattern constrains agent behavio=
r by defining explicit states and valid transitions. The agent can be in st=
ate A, B, or C, and can transition from A to B but not from A to C. This pr=
events the agent from wandering into unexpected states and makes reasoning =
about system behavior tractable. I use state machines for multi-step workfl=
ows where order matters and certain operations must complete before others =
begin.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">The approval queue pattern handles operations that r=
equire human judgment. High-risk actions don=E2=80=99t execute immediately=
=E2=80=94they enter a queue where humans review context and make decisions.=
 The queue interface shows enough information to make good decisions quickl=
y: what the agent wants to do, why, what the consequences are, what the rol=
lback plan is. This pattern lets me deploy agents in domains where full aut=
omation would be risky.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The confidence scoring pattern make=
s agent uncertainty explicit. When the agent performs classification or mak=
es recommendations, it reports a confidence score alongside the result. Low=
-confidence results get flagged for human review while high-confidence resu=
lts proceed automatically. Over time, I adjust the confidence threshold bas=
ed on observed accuracy=E2=80=94if high-confidence results prove reliable, =
I raise the automation threshold.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The tool result caching p=
attern reduces redundant computation. When the agent retrieves information =
or performs analysis, I cache the result with appropriate TTL. Subsequent t=
asks that need the same information reuse cached results rather than consum=
ing additional tokens. This pattern requires careful thinking about cache i=
nvalidation, but the token savings justify the complexity.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
The parallel execution pattern handles tasks that don=E2=80=99t depend on e=
ach other. Instead of processing sequentially, I dispatch multiple agents i=
n parallel and aggregate results. This pattern dramatically reduces end-to-=
end latency for batch operations and improves resource utilization. The agg=
regation step requires careful design to handle partial failures gracefully=
.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;font-fami=

 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=E2=80=
=99ve also seen consistent failure patterns that builders should avoid. The=
se patterns look reasonable during design but fail predictably in productio=
n.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">The unconstrained reasoning loop is the classic failure.=
 The agent tries approach A, which fails. It tries approach B, which also f=
ails. It keeps trying variations until it exhausts the token budget or hits=
 an iteration limit. The problem: it=E2=80=99s not learning from failures, =
just burning tokens. I prevent this by setting hard limits and requiring ex=
plicit escalation after a small number of failures.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The imp=
licit state problem occurs when agents assume state that isn=E2=80=99t expl=
icitly tracked. The agent remembers something from earlier in the conversat=
ion and acts on that memory, but the memory isn=E2=80=99t persisted anywher=
e. When the session ends, that state vanishes. Next time, the agent has to =
rediscover everything. I fix this by making all persistent state explicit a=
nd storing it deliberately.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The permission confusion proble=
m happens when agents have access to tools they shouldn=E2=80=99t use for p=
articular tasks. The agent can technically call any tool in its repertoire,=
 but some tools are inappropriate for specific scenarios. Without explicit =
permission management, agents occasionally invoke wrong tools with bad cons=
equences. I solve this by defining tool availability per task type rather t=
han per agent.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The error propagation problem occurs when ag=
ents treat errors as facts. External API calls fail, the agent receives an =
error message, and then incorporates that error into its reasoning as if it=
=E2=80=99s valid data. I prevent this by making error handling explicit at =
architectural boundaries and never letting raw errors propagate to agent co=
ntext.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">The cost explosion problem hits when agents use expe=
nsive models for simple tasks or invoke expensive tools unnecessarily. With=
out explicit cost awareness and routing logic, agents default to maximum-ca=
pability approaches for all problems. I fix this by routing tasks to approp=
riately-sized models and making agents aware of tool costs.</p><h2 class=3D=

 that captures every decision, tool invocation, and outcome. When something=
 goes wrong three days after deployment, I need to reconstruct exactly what=
 the agent was thinking. Structured logs with consistent schemas make this =
possible. I capture input state, reasoning steps, tool calls with parameter=

n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Prod=
uction systems need monitoring that detects degradation before users compla=
in. I track success rates, failure rates, latency distributions, token cons=
umption, and cost per outcome. I set alerts based on deviations from normal=
 patterns rather than absolute thresholds. If success rate drops 10% in an =
hour, I want to know immediately even if the absolute rate remains acceptab=
le.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
