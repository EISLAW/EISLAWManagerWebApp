DAILY MEMO: US POSTURE IN EUROPE, INDIA'S RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS [3]
WASHINGTON IS CONSIDERING MORE CUTS TO ITS TROOP PRESENCE ON THE CONTINENT.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
FURTHER WITHDRAWAL? The Trump administration has reportedly quietly signaled to European allies that it plans to reduce U.S. forces in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia starting next month, following a
similar scale-down in Romania. According to the Kyiv Post [4], Washington is justifying the potential move by saying European armies are better equipped now to handle continental defense.
Administration officials apparently described the recalibration as “marginal,” stressing that U.S. troop levels in Poland and the Baltic states would remain unchanged.
WORK-AROUND. India’s largest refiner, Indian Oil Corp., has resumed purchases of Russian crude despite U.S. pressure, buying five cargo shipments of oil for December delivery from non-sanctioned
entities, according to a Reuters report [5]. The move follows Washington’s recent imposition of sanctions against Russian firms Rosneft and Lukoil. IOC officials said earlier this week that the
company would continue buying Russian oil while also complying with the sanctions, after earlier canceling several cargoes linked to restricted firms.
RUSSIA IN CENTRAL ASIA. Military cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan is key to ensuring stability in Central Asia, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said [6] at a meeting with his Kazakh
counterpart. Belousov added that the Russian Defense Ministry was helping Kazakhstan improve its armed forces by training Kazakh service members in Russian military academies and sharing combat
experience.
LEBANESE AFFAIRS. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said [7] at a meeting with his chief army commander that the military should be prepared to resist any Israeli “incursion” into southern Lebanon.
Meanwhile, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and the Lebanese armed forces concluded [8] on Thursday weeklong joint maritime exercises.
PROTESTS IN ISRAEL. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis held a mass demonstration [9] against changes to the government’s conscription law. The protesters oppose moves to require students
enrolled at religious schools, who were previously exempt from the draft, to enlist in the military, as well as a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox Jews who have avoided the draft.
MILITARY SUPPORT. Turkey has begun training the Syrian army as part of an agreement signed in August to help rebuild Syria’s defenses, the Turkish Defense Ministry said [10]. It also announced that
87 percent of a 1,274-kilometer (792-mile) security wall on Turkey's borders with Syria and Iran has been completed. The wall and patrol roads are designed to combat illegal migration, smuggling and
terrorist threats.
UNREST IN MALI. An al-Qaida-linked militant group is coming closer to capturing the capital of Mali. If Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin succeeds in seizing the city, Bamako would be the first
world capital to fall under the control of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, according to The Wall Street Journal [11]. Earlier this week, the U.S. urged Americans to leave the country and
began partially evacuating its embassy.
FRANCE IN AFRICA. France pledged [12] to spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in aid for the Great Lakes region of Africa during an international conference in Paris on Thursday. French President
Emmanuel Macron also announced that the Goma Airport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will reopen in the coming weeks for humanitarian flights, after it was closed earlier this year following
the city’s seizure by M23 rebels. On Friday, the group called [13] the announcement “inopportune.”
KABUL'S VIEW. Afghanistan’s interior minister commented [14] for the first time on U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to restore U.S. control over Bagram Air Base. The minister said that Afghans
have “passed the test of the battlefield” and that the country was determined to defend its own interests. He also responded to statements by Pakistani officials regarding the activities of
militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (which Islamabad has accused Kabul of harboring), calling it an internal matter for Pakistan to address.
DEFENSE COOPERATION. The U.S. and Malaysia issued [15] a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to tackling emerging security challenges following a meeting between their top defense officials.
They also signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation and announced the renewal of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement.
ECONOMIC TIES. At a meeting between the commerce ministries of China and Laos, the two countries pledged [16] to enhance economic cooperation, trade and investment in their border areas.
