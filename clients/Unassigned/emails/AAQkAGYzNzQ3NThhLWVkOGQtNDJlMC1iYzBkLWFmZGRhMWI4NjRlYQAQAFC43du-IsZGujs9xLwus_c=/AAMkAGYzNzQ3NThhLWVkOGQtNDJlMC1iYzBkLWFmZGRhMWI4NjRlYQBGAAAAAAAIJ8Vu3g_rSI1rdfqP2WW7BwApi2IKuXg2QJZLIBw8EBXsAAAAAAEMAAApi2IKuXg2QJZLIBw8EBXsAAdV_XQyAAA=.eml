Question: You have pointed out the problem of labor shortage caused by the=
 need to care for the elderly and competition for cheap workers. Can robot=
ics and AI help solve the problem? Please also factor in the potential pro=
ductivity boosts these advancements could offer.

Response:
There is no question that artificial intelligence coupled with machines (r=
obots) will have a substantial impact on the manner in which we do many th=
ings=2C just as the automobile=2C radio and television=2C the telegraph an=
d the microchip have given humans more capacity and have all had enormous=
 impacts on society=2C good and bad. I regard artificial intelligence as a=
 significant improvement in computing=2C but I also think that the expecta=
tions of  what artificial intelligence is=2C and what it can do=2C have be=
en significantly overstated=2C as has been true for most transformative te=
chnologies before they matured. So the simple answer is that AI will solve=
 many problems=2C but that we now overstate its capabilities and impact. A=
nd it will draw vast amounts of workers out of the labor pool.

John McCarthy=2C in many ways the founder of AI=2C and the one who coined=
 the name =E2=80=9Cartificial intelligence=E2=80=9D said later that he reg=
retted using the name artificial intelligence. McCarthy said that seeing t=
he extreme expectations=2C he wished he had called it =E2=80=9Ccomputation=
al intelligence=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cmachine intelligence=2C=E2=80=9D whic=
h would have been better. He said he called it artificial intelligence bec=
ause it was a new way of designing and programming computers=2C and that h=
e wanted to draw attention to this new programming language and computing=
 model to attract others in the field. He said he regretted using the name=
 because it had led to confusion and hype about what artificial intelligen=
ce was and what it could do.

McCarthy said that all computing was about doing things in place of human=
 effort=2C such as my typing this response to you. In other words=2C compu=
ting is a tool to be used by human intelligence=2C and not an alternative=
 intelligence. He did succeed in attracting the attention of the computing=
 community with the use of the name he chose for it=2C never expecting the=
 amount of publicity and misunderstanding it generated.

Years ago=2C I was very marginally involved with a NATO project run by Sha=
pe Technical Center in The Hague. The project was intended to use artifici=
al intelligence to replace some military exercise that cost vast amounts o=
f money. While getting my doctorate in political philosophy=2C I sat in on=
 a class in the operations research department=2C where I heard that drama=
tic things were happening in artificial intelligence. I was fascinated. La=
ter=2C I wrangled a marginal role in the development of a game called Idah=
ex=2C modeling armored warfare. The programing depended on the use of a ne=
w language called LISP=2C for list processing=2C that was the AI language=
 developed by McCarthy=2C and from what I can tell=2C LISP=E2=80=99s desce=
ndants are still in use. The key to the game was the =E2=80=9Cexpert=E2=80=
=9D system=2C where human knowledge of a discipline could be turned into t=
he LISP language for processing. I was a minor part of the group that debr=
iefed armored officers=2C and asked them how they made the decision they m=
ade in a recent
major war game with that knowledge to be coded in LISP=2C and then include=
d in the expert system.

My job was to frame the questions and interview the officers by learning t=
he reasoning process they use through the steps in their decision making.=
 What I found was that the more experienced the officer=2C the less he cou=
ld explain how he made the decision he did. Younger officers could sort of=
 explain. The senior officers did not go through a process of thought that=
 could be parsed and therefore coded. The more experience they had and the=
 more they knew=2C the more sophisticated and capable they were=2C but the=
 less compatible their decision making was with the way LISP and computers=
 =E2=80=9Cthought.=E2=80=9D As one colonel put it=2C =E2=80=9CIf I had to=
 go through every step to fight=2C I=E2=80=99d be dead.=E2=80=9D

I admit this is a small example of being exposed to early AI. Still=2C thi=
s is not an experience unique to me; I=E2=80=99ve heard similar reports ev=
en recently. What I learned from that (and I can assure you no one cared w=
hat I learned) is that human intelligence is far more subtle than machine=
 intelligence=2C and that the more skilled and knowledgeable you are on a=
 subject=2C the less conscious you are of the process that produces the ri=
ght answer. The more experienced you are=2C the less mechanical is your th=
ought. Over time=2C the human mind turns intelligence from parsed steps to=
 something nearer to the subconscious that Freud spoke of.

When I sat down to type my answer to this question today=2C I knew what I=
 wanted to say but could not tell you beforehand how I would say it. It ju=
st flowed=2C for better or worse. In other words=2C McCarthy=E2=80=99s reg=
ret is valid. Artificial intelligence=2C as McCarthy knew=2C was a program=
ming language that required a code that parsed the thought. An expert=E2=
=80=99s mind has so digested its mission that it can no longer parse it. T=
he structure of intelligence in humans was far more subtle or subconscious=
=2E

So artificial intelligence was for McCarthy a marketing tool=2C and the ma=
rketing goes on. What we have is advanced computing=2C an invaluable tool=
=2C but not a substitute for human intelligence=2C which is infinitely mor=
e subtle and complex and far less understood consciously by humans themsel=
ves.

I have finished this answer=2C and I cannot tell you precisely how I did i=
t beyond being tasked to do it. So I accept McCarthy=E2=80=99s regrets and=
 understand them. AI may well transform our lives=2C but it will not repla=
ce human intelligence until we can explain precisely what that is. And it=
 is the lack of that precision that is the foundation of human reason.

So yes=2C robotics can replace human labor in some areas as long as there=
 are plenty of programmers and technicians to maintain the machines. As we=
 know=2C even the human mind is filled with erroneous thoughts and forgetf=
ulness=2C and any machine that actually replicates human thought will be t=
herefore filled with defects. So as humans have to be taught and human int=
eraction is essential for maintaining=2C repairing=2C and reinventing the=
 human mind=2C I am sure that AI and robots will to some extent solve the=
 demographic labor problems. But as with all technologies=2C a large numbe=
r of humans will be needed to maintain the robots and correct their functi=
oning. Human doctors must be subtle in their thinking=2C and above all emp=
athetic to their patient=E2=80=99s unique hopes and fears.  So what we cal=
l AI and robots will surely solve significant areas of the labor problems.=
 But subtract from that the number of humans that will be needed to manage=
 the robots and programs.

Artificial intelligence cannot replace human intelligence because human in=
telligence and machine intelligence are incompatible. There are many tasks=
 that computers can carry out=2C but the ability of an experienced physici=
an to look at and exchange pleasantries with a long-time patient and immed=
iately suspect that something is wrong is not one of them.


On a totally different question=2C I offer an apology for a mistake. It ha=
s been pointed out to me that Trump did not win a majority of votes as I c=
laimed. He won 49.8 percent of the vote with Harris quite close=2C and the=
 rest of the votes for third parties. Trump won the majority of electoral=

<strong>Response: </strong></p>

<div>There is no question that artificial intelligence coupled with machine=
s (robots) will have a substantial impact on the manner in which we do many=
 things, just as the automobile, radio and television, the telegraph and th=
e microchip have given humans more capacity and have all had enormous impac=
ts on society, good and bad. I regard artificial intelligence as a signific=
ant improvement in computing, but I also think that the expectations of&nbs=
p; what artificial intelligence is, and what it can do, have been significa=
ntly overstated, as has been true for most transformative technologies befo=
re they matured. So the simple answer is that AI will solve many problems, =
but that we now overstate its capabilities and impact. And it will draw vas=
t amounts of workers out of the labor pool.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
John McCarthy, in many ways the founder of AI, and the one who coined the n=
ame =E2=80=9Cartificial intelligence=E2=80=9D said later that he regretted =
using the name artificial intelligence. McCarthy said that seeing the extre=
me expectations, he wished he had called it =E2=80=9Ccomputational intellig=
ence=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cmachine intelligence,=E2=80=9D which would have b=
een better. He said he called it artificial intelligence because it was a n=
ew way of designing and programming computers, and that he wanted to draw a=
ttention to this new programming language and computing model to attract ot=
hers in the field. He said he regretted using the name because it had led t=
o confusion and hype about what artificial intelligence was and what it cou=
ld do.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
McCarthy said that all computing was about doing things in place of human e=
ffort, such as my typing this response to you. In other words, computing is=
 a tool to be used by human intelligence, and not an alternative intelligen=
ce. He did succeed in attracting the attention of the computing community w=
ith the use of the name he chose for it, never expecting the amount of publ=
icity and misunderstanding it generated.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Years ago, I was very marginally involved with a NATO project run by Shape =
Technical Center in The Hague. The project was intended to use artificial i=
ntelligence to replace some military exercise that cost vast amounts of mon=
ey. While getting my doctorate in political philosophy, I sat in on a class=
 in the operations research department, where I heard that dramatic things =
were happening in artificial intelligence. I was fascinated. Later, I wrang=
led a marginal role in the development of a game called Idahex, modeling ar=
mored warfare. The programing depended on the use of a new language called =
LISP, for list processing, that was the AI language developed by McCarthy, =
and from what I can tell, LISP=E2=80=99s descendants are still in use. The =
key to the game was the =E2=80=9Cexpert=E2=80=9D system, where human knowle=
dge of a discipline could be turned into the LISP language for processing. =
I was a minor part of the group that debriefed armored officers, and asked =
them how they made the decision they made in a recent major war game with t=
hat knowledge to be coded in LISP, and then included in the expert system.<=
br>
&nbsp;<br>
My job was to frame the questions and interview the officers by learning th=
e reasoning process they use through the steps in their decision making. Wh=
at I found was that the more experienced the officer, the less he could exp=
lain how he made the decision he did. Younger officers could sort of explai=
n. The senior officers did not go through a process of thought that could b=
e parsed and therefore coded. The more experience they had and the more the=
y knew, the more sophisticated and capable they were, but the less compatib=
le their decision making was with the way LISP and computers =E2=80=9Cthoug=
ht.=E2=80=9D As one colonel put it, =E2=80=9CIf I had to go through every s=
tep to fight, I=E2=80=99d be dead.=E2=80=9D&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I admit this is a small example of being exposed to early AI. Still, this i=
s not an experience unique to me; I=E2=80=99ve heard similar reports even r=
ecently. What I learned from that (and I can assure you no one cared what I=
 learned) is that human intelligence is far more subtle than machine intell=
igence, and that the more skilled and knowledgeable you are on a subject, t=
he less conscious you are of the process that produces the right answer. Th=
e more experienced you are, the less mechanical is your thought. Over time,=
 the human mind turns intelligence from parsed steps to something nearer to=
 the subconscious that Freud spoke of.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When I sat down to type my answer to this question today, I knew what I wan=
ted to say but could not tell you beforehand how I would say it. It just fl=
owed, for better or worse. In other words, McCarthy=E2=80=99s regret is val=
id. Artificial intelligence, as McCarthy knew, was a programming language t=
hat required a code that parsed the thought. An expert=E2=80=99s mind has s=
o digested its mission that it can no longer parse it. The structure of int=
elligence in humans was far more subtle or subconscious.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So artificial intelligence was for McCarthy a marketing tool, and the marke=
ting goes on. What we have is advanced computing, an invaluable tool, but n=
ot a substitute for human intelligence, which is infinitely more subtle and=
 complex and far less understood consciously by humans themselves.&nbsp;<br=
>
&nbsp;<br>
I have finished this answer, and I cannot tell you precisely how I did it b=
eyond being tasked to do it. So I accept McCarthy=E2=80=99s regrets and und=
erstand them. AI may well transform our lives, but it will not replace huma=
n intelligence until we can explain precisely what that is. And it is the l=
ack of that precision that is the foundation of human reason.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So yes, robotics can replace human labor in some areas as long as there are=
 plenty of programmers and technicians to maintain the machines. As we know=
, even the human mind is filled with erroneous thoughts and forgetfulness, =
and any machine that actually replicates human thought will be therefore fi=
lled with defects. So as humans have to be taught and human interaction is =
essential for maintaining, repairing, and reinventing the human mind, I am =
sure that AI and robots will to some extent solve the demographic labor pro=
blems. But as with all technologies, a large number of humans will be neede=
d to maintain the robots and correct their functioning. Human doctors must =
be subtle in their thinking, and above all empathetic to their patient=E2=
=80=99s unique hopes and fears.&nbsp; So what we call AI and robots will su=
rely solve significant areas of the labor problems. But subtract from that =
the number of humans that will be needed to manage the robots and programs.=
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Artificial intelligence cannot replace human intelligence because human int=
elligence and machine intelligence are incompatible. There are many tasks t=
hat computers can carry out, but the ability of an experienced physician to=
 look at and exchange pleasantries with a long-time patient and immediately=
 suspect that something is wrong is not one of them.<br>

On a totally different question, I offer an apology for a mistake. It has b=
een pointed out to me that Trump did not win a majority of votes as I claim=
ed. He won 49.8 percent of the vote with Harris quite close, and the rest o=
f the votes for third parties. Trump won the majority of electoral votes of=
 course. In none of his three runs for president did he win the majority of=
 votes.</div>
