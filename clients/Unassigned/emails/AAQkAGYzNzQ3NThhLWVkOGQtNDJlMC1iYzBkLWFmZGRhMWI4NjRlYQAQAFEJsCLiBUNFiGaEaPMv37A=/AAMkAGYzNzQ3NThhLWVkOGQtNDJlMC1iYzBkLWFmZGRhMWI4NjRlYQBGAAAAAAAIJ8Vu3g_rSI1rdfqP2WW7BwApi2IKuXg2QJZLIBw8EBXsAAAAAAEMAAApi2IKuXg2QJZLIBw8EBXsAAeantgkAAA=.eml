WHY PEACE BY FORCE WILL NOT WORK IN THE MIDDLE EAST [3]
IT’S UNLIKELY TO RESOLVE A CONFLICT THAT HAS ENDURED FOR OVER A CENTURY.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
The Gaza ceasefire deal stipulates that a lasting peace is one in which both Palestinians and Israelis can thrive, protect their fundamental human rights, ensure their security and preserve their
dignity. It emphasizes that a new chapter has opened in the region, one in which future disputes can be resolved through diplomacy rather than conflict.
The problem with the agreement is that it traces the origins of hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians to Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023, ignoring the fact that the conflict actually began
with the 1897 Basel Program. That document was the outcome of the first Zionist Congress held in Basel, Switzerland, and called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, which had a
population at the time of 600,000 people, 95 percent of which was Arab. The deal struck in Sharm el-Sheikh last week is fundamentally flawed because it relies on an approach of peace by force –
highly unlikely to resolve a conflict that has endured for 128 years and whose underlying causes have survived in the collective consciousness of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims around the world. This
paper argues that the peace plan will not work, and that Israeli territorial expansionism will continue beyond Gaza and the West Bank.
OBSESSION WITH POWER
Israel has long sought to achieve political ends through military might. Zeev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism, said that there can be no return to the “promised land” or to a pure
Jewish state without violence and usurpation. Menachem Begin, who was a prominent member of the Irgun terrorist organization before becoming prime minister in 1977, said that establishing Greater
Israel “can only be achieved by crushing others, for it is absurd to speak of participation and coexistence.” Earlier this month, the pro-Israel Middle East Forum wrote: “Real peace will only
come after Israel achieves a clear victory … after the complete defeat of its enemies.” Former Mossad agent Avner Avraham admitted that Israel constantly searches for new enemies. According to
him, Israeli decision-makers perceive peace not as an objective but as a strategy for further territorial expansion.
In his speech before the Knesset in Jerusalem, U.S. President Donald Trump said Israel achieved victory by force. He also said the U.S. has provided Israel with weapons so that it can impose its own
vision of peace on the Middle East. Through these comments, Trump is redefining what peace means in the region, making it synonymous with domination and oppression rather than justice and values.
Immediately after the ceasefire in Gaza was implemented, the Israeli military activated an alleged secret clause that allows it to open fire if it detects a threat from Hamas fighters. As a result,
dozens of Palestinians were killed. To be clear, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, but the incident indicates Israel’s willingness to achieve its desired ends through
force rather than diplomatic means, revealing its aim to reshape the region based on its overwhelming military superiority. Indeed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters are redefining
modern Jewish identity on the basis that land is an indivisible historical right and that the Jewish community is constantly under threat and in need of preemptive protection.
The resumption of Israeli airstrikes also highlights the similarities between the situations in Gaza and Lebanon. Last week, Israel ignored Lebanese President Joseph Aoun’s offer to negotiate an end
to the two countries’ conflict. Since then, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have only intensified, sending a clear message that Israel plans to use force to establish a fait accompli on the ground,
achieving what the ceasefire signed last November hasn’t thus far. The Israeli government’s objective is evident: force Lebanon to adhere to Israeli terms and complete the disarmament of
Hezbollah, even without an agreement on border demarcation.
Netanyahu’s absence from the Sharm el-Sheikh summit revealed his desire to distance himself from any commitment to end the war or launch a political process with the Palestinians – which would
anger his right-wing base. He accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return all the bodies of kidnapped Israelis and emphasized that he would take firm action on this issue.
Hamas, however, says it lacks the equipment needed to remove the rubble under which the bodies are trapped. (In fact, the bodies of thousands of Palestinians are also still trapped under the rubble
because Israel destroyed the machinery needed to recover them.) Turkey offered to send 80 debris removal experts to assist in recovering the remains, but Netanyahu declined, asserting that Hamas could
manage the task on its own. In response, Egypt’s foreign minister said Hamas was committed to the terms of the Gaza agreement and needed more time to complete its mission.
LIVING IN DENIAL
Israel’s stance on peace with the Palestinians is clear: It categorically rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, despite the fact that this issue is at the heart of its broader conflict with the
Arab world. Jordanian King Abdullah has warned of a bleak future for the Middle East without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Similarly, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has made
peace in the region contingent on Palestinian statehood.
Some Israelis have also noted the importance of the statehood matter. In 2017, former Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said he was waiting for an Israeli leader to emerge who could publicly
acknowledge the enormous Palestinian tragedy. He considered Netanyahu’s insistence on Israel as a Jewish state problematic and said ordinary Israelis live in denial over this issue, viewing
Palestinians as untrustworthy and Palestinian hardship as a security concern. In fact, many Israelis, such as former Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, say that if Israel continues this way,
it could turn into an apartheid state like South Africa, a comparison that underscores the gravity of the situation.
Since its establishment, Israel has not put forward a single peace proposal or agreed to discuss any Arab-proposed peace plans. Instead, it has unilaterally pursued peace with individual Arab states.
It prefers a peace imposed by U.S. power with Arab governments that will give it a degree of influence in a region with which it has no connection.
In 1949, Syrian President Husni al-Zaim accepted U.N. General Assembly resolution 194, which called for repatriating or compensating Palestinian refugees. He offered to naturalize 400,000 refugees if
Israel agreed to repatriate 100,000 displaced Palestinians, thus ending the refugee question. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion declined al-Zaim’s offer, claiming that the price for peace was
too high. In 1981, the Saudi crown prince proposed an initiative to establish peace between Arab nations and Israel in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state, but Israel declined. A
year later, members of the Arab League officially adopted the proposal, but Israel again dismissed it, even though Arab nations agreed that the Security Council would establish guarantees for peace
between the countries of the region. In 1996, the Arab League adopted the principle that just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East was the “strategic option” for Arab countries, on the
condition that a Palestinian state could be established. However, Israel did not respond to the initiative, which was subsequently readopted at the Arab League summit in 2002.
ARAB PUBLIC ANGER
Anger over this situation has been growing for years across the Arab world. In 1997, a Jordanian soldier killed seven Israeli girls during a tour to a border area, claiming they had mocked him while
he was praying. Some Jordanians consider him a hero, believing he killed the girls to protest the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. In June 2023, a 20-year-old Egyptian policeman crossed the
border and killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded several others. The fact that the shooter was born 25 years after the Camp David Accords attests to the deep roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arab social media was abuzz with comments hailing the policeman as a national hero. A day after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, an Egyptian policeman killed two Israeli tourists in Alexandria after they
insisted on taking photos with the Israeli flag, in violation of regulations. In May 2024, Egyptian and Israeli forces clashed near the Rafah border crossing, resulting in the death of an Egyptian
soldier.
Trump has expressed his hope that more countries will join the Abraham Accords, saying that several Arab and Islamic countries had informed him of their willingness to sign peace agreements with
Israel. He emphasized that if Saudi Arabia signs a peace deal, all Arab and Islamic countries would follow suit. The normalization deals are named after Abraham (Prophet Ibrahim to Muslims), a key
figure in both the Jewish and Muslim faiths. However, what supporters of the accords failed to recognize is that, according to the Torah, God granted Abraham and his descendants eternal ownership of
the land of Canaan, which includes, in addition to historic Palestine, Lebanon and southwestern and central Syria, the area into which Israel has been penetrating since the fall of Bashar Assad’s
regime in December 2024.
Israel’s rise in the Middle East occurred while the Arab region suffered from a profound structural imbalance. The modern Arab state inherited from colonialism a bloated bureaucracy that has
exploited society and excluded it from politics and decision-making. It has failed to create a modern educational system that transcends indoctrination, inhibiting critical thinking. Meanwhile,
jurists have been unable to overcome religious stagnation, reducing jurisprudence to rituals and delegitimizing the value of individual character and national identification. Society lost the ability
to think about a better future and cut itself off from the past, leading to marginalization and detachment from reality. National issues faded away, replaced by sectarianism, ethnicity and political
incompetence. The failed Arab uprisings gave a new mandate to authoritarianism, as opposition movements lacked maturity and achievable objectives. The deterioration of Arab societies made it easier
for Israel to dominate the region and exploit divisions to promote its regional project.
In 1905, Lebanese Maronite Christian Najib Azoury wrote a book about the awakening of the Arab nation, arguing that the 20th century would witness a massive conflict between the Arabs and the Zionist
project, whose goals extend beyond Palestine. This initiative, he argued, was designed to engineer the future of the region, exploit its divisions and redefine its borders when opportunities arose.
The conflict will go on, he said, until one side soundly defeats the other.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Gaza ceasefire=
 deal stipulates that a lasting peace is one in which both Palestinians and=
 Israelis can thrive, protect their fundamental human rights, ensure their =
security and preserve their dignity. It emphasizes that a new chapter has o=
pened in the region, one in which future disputes can be resolved through d=
iplomacy rather than conflict.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The problem with t=
he agreement is that it traces the origins of hostilities between Israel an=
d the Palestinians to Hamas=E2=80=99 attack on Oct. 7, 2023, ignoring the f=
act that the conflict actually began with the 1897 Basel Program. That docu=
ment was the outcome of the first Zionist Congress held in Basel, Switzerla=
nd, and called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, which =
had a population at the time of 600,000 people, 95 percent of which was Ara=
b. The deal struck in Sharm el-Sheikh last week is fundamentally flawed bec=
ause it relies on an approach of peace by force =E2=80=93 highly unlikely t=
o resolve a conflict that has endured for 128 years and whose underlying ca=
uses have survived in the collective consciousness of Palestinians, Arabs a=
nd Muslims around the world. This paper argues that the peace plan will not=
 work, and that Israeli territorial expansionism will continue beyond Gaza =
and the West Bank.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Obsession =
With Power</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel has long so=
ught to achieve political ends through military might. Zeev Jabotinsky, the=
 founder of Revisionist Zionism, said that there can be no return to the =
=E2=80=9Cpromised land=E2=80=9D or to a pure Jewish state without violence =
and usurpation. Menachem Begin, who was a prominent member of the Irgun ter=
rorist organization before becoming prime minister in 1977, said that estab=
lishing Greater Israel =E2=80=9Ccan only be achieved by crushing others, fo=
r it is absurd to speak of participation and coexistence.=E2=80=9D Earlier =
this month, the pro-Israel Middle East Forum wrote: =E2=80=9CReal peace wil=
l only come after Israel achieves a clear victory =E2=80=A6 after the compl=
ete defeat of its enemies.=E2=80=9D Former Mossad agent Avner Avraham admit=
ted that Israel constantly searches for new enemies. According to him, Isra=
eli decision-makers perceive peace not as an objective but as a strategy fo=
r further territorial expansion.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In his speech befo=
re the Knesset in Jerusalem, U.S. President Donald Trump said Israel achiev=
ed victory by force. He also said the U.S. has provided Israel with weapons=
 so that it can impose its own vision of peace on the Middle East. Through =
these comments, Trump is redefining what peace means in the region, making =
it synonymous with domination and oppression rather than justice and values=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Immediately after =
the ceasefire in Gaza was implemented, the Israeli military activated an al=
leged secret clause that allows it to open fire if it detects a threat from=
 Hamas fighters. As a result, dozens of Palestinians were killed. To be cle=
ar, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, but the =
incident indicates Israel=E2=80=99s willingness to achieve its desired ends=
 through force rather than diplomatic means, revealing its aim to reshape t=
he region based on its overwhelming military superiority. Indeed, Prime Min=
ister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters are redefining modern Jewish id=
entity on the basis that land is an indivisible historical right and that t=
he Jewish community is constantly under threat and in need of preemptive pr=
otection.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The resumption of =
Israeli airstrikes also highlights the similarities between the situations =
in Gaza and Lebanon. Last week, Israel ignored Lebanese President Joseph Ao=
un=E2=80=99s offer to negotiate an end to the two countries=E2=80=99 confli=
ct. Since then, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have only intensified, sendin=
g a clear message that Israel plans to use force to establish a fait accomp=
li on the ground, achieving what the ceasefire signed last November hasn=E2=
=80=99t thus far. The Israeli government=E2=80=99s objective is evident: fo=
rce Lebanon to adhere to Israeli terms and complete the disarmament of Hezb=
ollah, even without an agreement on border demarcation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Netanyahu=E2=80=99=
s absence from the Sharm el-Sheikh summit revealed his desire to distance h=
imself from any commitment to end the war or launch a political process wit=
h the Palestinians =E2=80=93 which would anger his right-wing base. He accu=
sed Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return all the=
 bodies of kidnapped Israelis and emphasized that he would take firm action=
 on this issue. Hamas, however, says it lacks the equipment needed to remov=
e the rubble under which the bodies are trapped. (In fact, the bodies of th=
ousands of Palestinians are also still trapped under the rubble because Isr=
ael destroyed the machinery needed to recover them.) Turkey offered to send=
 80 debris removal experts to assist in recovering the remains, but Netanya=
hu declined, asserting that Hamas could manage the task on its own. In resp=
onse, Egypt=E2=80=99s foreign minister said Hamas was committed to the term=
s of the Gaza agreement and needed more time to complete its mission.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Living in =
Denial</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s s=
tance on peace with the Palestinians is clear: It categorically rejects the=
 idea of a Palestinian state, despite the fact that this issue is at the he=
art of its broader conflict with the Arab world. Jordanian King Abdullah ha=
s warned of a bleak future for the Middle East without the establishment of=
 a Palestinian state. Similarly, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi h=
as made peace in the region contingent on Palestinian statehood.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Some Israelis have=
 also noted the importance of the statehood matter. In 2017, former Israeli=
 Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said he was waiting for an Israeli leader =
to emerge who could publicly acknowledge the enormous Palestinian tragedy. =
He considered Netanyahu=E2=80=99s insistence on Israel as a Jewish state pr=
oblematic and said ordinary Israelis live in denial over this issue, viewin=
g Palestinians as untrustworthy and Palestinian hardship as a security conc=
ern. In fact, many Israelis, such as former Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and =
Ehud Olmert, say that if Israel continues this way, it could turn into an a=
partheid state like South Africa, a comparison that underscores the gravity=
 of the situation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Since its establis=
hment, Israel has not put forward a single peace proposal or agreed to disc=
uss any Arab-proposed peace plans. Instead, it has unilaterally pursued pea=
ce with individual Arab states. It prefers a peace imposed by U.S. power wi=
th Arab governments that will give it a degree of influence in a region wit=
h which it has no connection.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 1949, Syrian Pr=
esident Husni al-Zaim accepted U.N. General Assembly resolution 194, which =
called for repatriating or compensating Palestinian refugees. He offered to=
 naturalize 400,000 refugees if Israel agreed to repatriate 100,000 displac=
ed Palestinians, thus ending the refugee question. Israeli Prime Minister D=
avid Ben Gurion declined al-Zaim=E2=80=99s offer, claiming that the price f=
or peace was too high. In 1981, the Saudi crown prince proposed an initiati=
ve to establish peace between Arab nations and Israel in exchange for the e=
stablishment of a Palestinian state, but Israel declined. A year later, mem=
bers of the Arab League officially adopted the proposal, but Israel again d=
ismissed it, even though Arab nations agreed that the Security Council woul=
d establish guarantees for peace between the countries of the region. In 19=
96, the Arab League adopted the principle that just and comprehensive peace=
 in the Middle East was the =E2=80=9Cstrategic option=E2=80=9D for Arab cou=
ntries, on the condition that a Palestinian state could be established. How=
ever, Israel did not respond to the initiative, which was subsequently read=
opted at the Arab League summit in 2002.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Arab Publi=
c Anger</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Anger over this si=
tuation has been growing for years across the Arab world. In 1997, a Jordan=
ian soldier killed seven Israeli girls during a tour to a border area, clai=
ming they had mocked him while he was praying. Some Jordanians consider him=
 a hero, believing he killed the girls to protest the peace treaty between =
Jordan and Israel. In June 2023, a 20-year-old Egyptian policeman crossed t=
he border and killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded several others. The=
 fact that the shooter was born 25 years after the Camp David Accords attes=
ts to the deep roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Arab social media was ab=
uzz with comments hailing the policeman as a national hero. A day after Ham=
as=E2=80=99 Oct. 7 attack, an Egyptian policeman killed two Israeli tourist=
s in Alexandria after they insisted on taking photos with the Israeli flag,=
 in violation of regulations. In May 2024, Egyptian and Israeli forces clas=
hed near the Rafah border crossing, resulting in the death of an Egyptian s=
oldier.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump has expresse=
d his hope that more countries will join the Abraham Accords, saying that s=
everal Arab and Islamic countries had informed him of their willingness to =
sign peace agreements with Israel. He emphasized that if Saudi Arabia signs=
 a peace deal, all Arab and Islamic countries would follow suit. The normal=
ization deals are named after Abraham (Prophet Ibrahim to Muslims), a key f=
igure in both the Jewish and Muslim faiths. However, what supporters of the=
 accords failed to recognize is that, according to the Torah, God granted A=
braham and his descendants eternal ownership of the land of Canaan, which i=
ncludes, in addition to historic Palestine, Lebanon and southwestern and ce=
ntral Syria, the area into which Israel has been penetrating since the fall=
 of Bashar Assad=E2=80=99s regime in December 2024.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s r=
ise in the Middle East occurred while the Arab region suffered from a profo=
und structural imbalance. The modern Arab state inherited from colonialism =
a bloated bureaucracy that has exploited society and excluded it from polit=
ics and decision-making. It has failed to create a modern educational syste=
m that transcends indoctrination, inhibiting critical thinking. Meanwhile, =
jurists have been unable to overcome religious stagnation, reducing jurispr=
udence to rituals and delegitimizing the value of individual character and =
national identification. Society lost the ability to think about a better f=
uture and cut itself off from the past, leading to marginalization and deta=
chment from reality. National issues faded away, replaced by sectarianism, =
ethnicity and political incompetence. The failed Arab uprisings gave a new =
mandate to authoritarianism, as opposition movements lacked maturity and ac=
hievable objectives. The deterioration of Arab societies made it easier for=
 Israel to dominate the region and exploit divisions to promote its regiona=
l project.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In 1905, Lebanese =
Maronite Christian Najib Azoury wrote a book about the awakening of the Ara=
b nation, arguing that the 20th century would witness a massive conflict be=
tween the Arabs and the Zionist project, whose goals extend beyond Palestin=
e. This initiative, he argued, was designed to engineer the future of the r=
egion, exploit its divisions and redefine its borders when opportunities ar=
ose. The conflict will go on, he said, until one side soundly defeats the o=
ther.</p>
