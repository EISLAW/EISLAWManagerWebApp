WHY HAVEN’T RUSSIANS REVOLTED? [3]
A COUPLE OF INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENTS HELP EXPLAIN THE LACK OF RESISTENCE.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
Throughout history, a certain pattern has emerged in times of war that looks something like this: A protracted conflict depletes the budget and resources of a warring country and eventually leads to
widespread discontent among the population as living standards decline and opposition movements grow. By that logic, there should be mass unrest in Russia. There is no end in sight to the war in
Ukraine, even as enemy drones damage property and occasionally kill Russian citizens. Talks with the United States have not just stalled; they have degraded bilateral relations. More, Moscow has had
to alter its tax code to continue to fund the war, creating larger financial burdens on businesses and citizens alike.
And yet, after three and a half years of war, Russia is relatively placid. President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings remain high, and there is a noted uptick in patriotic sentiment in much of the
country. Tempting as it may be to write this off as a symptom of autocratic rule, there are deeper societal changes underway that explain why Russia is bucking the historical trend of wartime
discontent.
[Support for President Putin in Russia] [4]

One of these changes is taking place within the government itself. In modern Russia, power has generally been divided into three segments: the rulers themselves, the systemic opposition, which is
represented in government structures and works with the rulers, and the non-systemic opposition, which opposes the rulers and is thus excluded entirely from the decision-making process. Given
Russia’s size and population, the Kremlin has an imperative to consolidate power by establishing regime-friendly hubs in major cities and far-flung regions. It’s nothing short of a necessary
precondition to forestall protests.
And in theory, there is plenty of reason to protest. Yes, the war in Ukraine has cost Russia a lot of money and lives, but even before the conflict, Ukraine was seen as a fraternal ally, and many
Russians considered an invasion unthinkable. Mass mobilization, early failures and increased international pressure could have pushed masses to the streets. But they didn’t. Crucially, there was an
insurrection led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, and participants thought to be non-systemic opposition fled the country or died. Dissatisfaction remains, but for the most part, it’s
passive, muted discontent rather than animated rage. Generally speaking, Russian citizens aren’t being killed en masse or forced to live in the streets; they are being forced to endure slower
internet speeds and surrender some of the luxuries they once enjoyed. (The region of Kursk is an obvious exception.)

More, Russia has skillfully reduced the representation of the non-systemic opposition in power, best exemplified by the most recent elections. From Sept 12-14, Russians voted for regional governors in
20 areas, determined the composition of legislative assemblies in 11 regions and formed new city councils in 25 municipalities. The ruling United Russia party improved its standing in regional
legislative assembly elections, even in several previously hostile areas in which members of the non-systemic opposition once served in the Duma. This means that power remains in the hands of the
ruling party and the systemic opposition. Problems that arise from budgetary constraints, tax payments and central bank policy have, of course, pitted parts of the establishment against one another.
In fact, there is a growing division [10] among pro-war and pro-peace factions within the government, though it’s hardly wide enough to cause any real damage or defection. For the most part, all
institutions, strategically important state-owned companies, the central bank and the parties represented in power are following a common course, especially in the realm of foreign policy.
By purging the non-systemic opposition, the rulers have created an emergent government more loyal than previous ones, partly by promoting veterans of the war. At a post-election meeting with the new
heads of the country's regions, Putin announced that officials need to recruit participants in the "special military operation" into their personnel policies more actively. He launched the federal
“Time of Heroes” development program, aimed at providing specialized training for veterans and participants in the Ukraine conflict. Considering that veterans currently hold some of the
highest-paying jobs and enjoy extensive state benefits, the Kremlin is counting on their loyalty and patriotism.
The second change underway in Russian society is a growing affinity for national identity and culture. Though there are certainly state programs meant to promote this very sentiment, this has been a
mostly independent phenomenon. On VKontakte – Russia’s analogue to Facebook – users are increasingly posting content related to Russian culture: historical costumes, travel photos and the like.
Russian cultural motifs are increasingly featured in clothing, accessories, films and music. (A popular folk singer from the 1990s named Nadezhda Kadysheva is experiencing something of a renaissance.)
Last weekend, I attended an event in which lectures on Russian folklore were held and traditional goods such as kokoshniks (traditional headdresses) were sold. The event was not state-sponsored; if
anything, many vendors complained about insufficient funding from a government ostensibly interested in promoting traditional culture.
On the one hand, the newfound interest in Russian culture plays into the hands of the Kremlin. It pits Russian values against Western ones and generally explains the long and grueling war in Ukraine
as a struggle against NATO. “Family values” often refer to participation in World War II by ancestors, which adds a sense of reverence to the war in Ukraine. This spares the government from having
to continue to justify war costs (slated to reach 13 trillion rubles, or $157 billion, by 2028) to a more dutiful population.
On the other hand, cultural affinity doesn’t necessarily do much to unite the state and the people. A desire to share historical traditions isn’t tantamount to blind obedience to the state,
especially if the state is responsible for the decline in their standard of living. In fact, a majority of the population favors a negotiated solution. Modern Russia is also multinational, so Moscow
would risk inciting the kind of protests it wants to avoid if it were to actively promote one culture over another.
All this is to say there are societal trends in Russia that have created the conditions for the rulers to maintain power, despite the fact that the financial necessities of war make their positions
inherently vulnerable. Geopolitically, though, this suggests the war in Ukraine will continue until Moscow can secure terms that it and its people can live with.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Throughout history=
, a certain pattern has emerged in times of war that looks something like t=
his: A protracted conflict depletes the budget and resources of a warring c=
ountry and eventually leads to widespread discontent among the population a=
s living standards decline and opposition movements grow. By that logic, th=
ere should be mass unrest in Russia. There is no end in sight to the war in=
 Ukraine, even as enemy drones damage property and occasionally kill Russia=
n citizens. Talks with the United States have not just stalled; they have d=
egraded bilateral relations. More, Moscow has had to alter its tax code to =
continue to fund the war, creating larger financial burdens on businesses a=
nd citizens alike.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">And yet, after thr=
ee and a half years of war, Russia is relatively placid. President Vladimir=
 Putin=E2=80=99s approval ratings remain high, and there is a noted uptick =
in patriotic sentiment in much of the country. Tempting as it may be to wri=
te this off as a symptom of autocratic rule, there are deeper societal chan=
ges underway that explain why Russia is bucking the historical trend of war=
time discontent.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">One of these chang=
es is taking place within the government itself. In modern Russia, power ha=
s generally been divided into three segments: the rulers themselves, the sy=
stemic opposition, which is represented in government structures and works =
with the rulers, and the non-systemic opposition, which opposes the rulers =
and is thus excluded entirely from the decision-making process. Given Russi=
a=E2=80=99s size and population, the Kremlin has an imperative to consolida=
te power by establishing regime-friendly hubs in major cities and far-flung=
 regions. It=E2=80=99s nothing short of a necessary precondition to foresta=
ll protests.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">And in theory, the=
re is plenty of reason to protest. Yes, the war in Ukraine has cost Russia =
a lot of money and lives, but even before the conflict, Ukraine was seen as=
 a fraternal ally, and many Russians considered an invasion unthinkable. Ma=
ss mobilization, early failures and increased international pressure could =
have pushed masses to the streets. But they didn=E2=80=99t. Crucially, ther=
e was an insurrection led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, and part=
icipants thought to be non-systemic opposition fled the country or died. Di=
ssatisfaction remains, but for the most part, it=E2=80=99s passive, muted d=
iscontent rather than animated rage. Generally speaking, Russian citizens a=
ren=E2=80=99t being killed en masse or forced to live in the streets; they =
are being forced to endure slower internet speeds and surrender some of the=
 luxuries they once enjoyed. (The region of Kursk is an obvious exception.)=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">More, Russia has s=
killfully reduced the representation of the non-systemic opposition in powe=
r, best exemplified by the most recent elections. From Sept 12-14, Russians=
 voted for regional governors in 20 areas, determined the composition of le=
gislative assemblies in 11 regions and formed new city councils in 25 munic=
ipalities. The ruling United Russia party improved its standing in regional=
 legislative assembly elections, even in several previously hostile areas i=
n which members of the non-systemic opposition once served in the Duma. Thi=
s means that power remains in the hands of the ruling party and the systemi=
c opposition. Problems that arise from budgetary constraints, tax payments =
and central bank policy have, of course, pitted parts of the establishment =
against one another. In fact, there is a <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfut=

dHkv" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">growing =
division</a> among pro-war and pro-peace factions within the government, th=
ough it=E2=80=99s hardly wide enough to cause any real damage or defection.=
 For the most part, all institutions, strategically important state-owned c=
ompanies, the central bank and the parties represented in power are followi=
ng a common course, especially in the realm of foreign policy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">By purging the non=
-systemic opposition, the rulers have created an emergent government more l=
oyal than previous ones, partly by promoting veterans of the war. At a post=
-election meeting with the new heads of the country's regions, Putin announ=
ced that officials need to recruit participants in the &quot;special milita=
ry operation&quot; into their personnel policies more actively. He launched=
 the federal =E2=80=9CTime of Heroes=E2=80=9D development program, aimed at=
 providing specialized training for veterans and participants in the Ukrain=
e conflict. Considering that veterans currently hold some of the highest-pa=
ying jobs and enjoy extensive state benefits, the Kremlin is counting on th=
eir loyalty and patriotism.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The second change =
underway in Russian society is a growing affinity for national identity and=
 culture. Though there are certainly state programs meant to promote this v=
ery sentiment, this has been a mostly independent phenomenon. On VKontakte =
=E2=80=93 Russia=E2=80=99s analogue to Facebook =E2=80=93 users are increas=
ingly posting content related to Russian culture: historical costumes, trav=
el photos and the like. Russian cultural motifs are increasingly featured i=
n clothing, accessories, films and music. (A popular folk singer from the 1=
990s named Nadezhda Kadysheva is experiencing something of a renaissance.) =
Last weekend, I attended an event in which lectures on Russian folklore wer=
e held and traditional goods such as kokoshniks (traditional headdresses) w=
ere sold. The event was not state-sponsored; if anything, many vendors comp=
lained about insufficient funding from a government ostensibly interested i=
n promoting traditional culture.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On the one hand, t=
he newfound interest in Russian culture plays into the hands of the Kremlin=
. It pits Russian values against Western ones and generally explains the lo=
ng and grueling war in Ukraine as a struggle against NATO. =E2=80=9CFamily =
values=E2=80=9D often refer to participation in World War II by ancestors, =
which adds a sense of reverence to the war in Ukraine. This spares the gove=
rnment from having to continue to justify war costs (slated to reach 13 tri=
llion rubles, or $157 billion, by 2028) to a more dutiful population.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On the other hand,=
 cultural affinity doesn=E2=80=99t necessarily do much to unite the state a=
nd the people. A desire to share historical traditions isn=E2=80=99t tantam=
ount to blind obedience to the state, especially if the state is responsibl=
e for the decline in their standard of living. In fact, a majority of the p=
opulation favors a negotiated solution. Modern Russia is also multinational=
, so Moscow would risk inciting the kind of protests it wants to avoid if i=
t were to actively promote one culture over another.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">All this is to say=
 there are societal trends in Russia that have created the conditions for t=
he rulers to maintain power, despite the fact that the financial necessitie=
s of war make their positions inherently vulnerable. Geopolitically, though=
, this suggests the war in Ukraine will continue until Moscow can secure te=
rms that it and its people can live with.</p>
