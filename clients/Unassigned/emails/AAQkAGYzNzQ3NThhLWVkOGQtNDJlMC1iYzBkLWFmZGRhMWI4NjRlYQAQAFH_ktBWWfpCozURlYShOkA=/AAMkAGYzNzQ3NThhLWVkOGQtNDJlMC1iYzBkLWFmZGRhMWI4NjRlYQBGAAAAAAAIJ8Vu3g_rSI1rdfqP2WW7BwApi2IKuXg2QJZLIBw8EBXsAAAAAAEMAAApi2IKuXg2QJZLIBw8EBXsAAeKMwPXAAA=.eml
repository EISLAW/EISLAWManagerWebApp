GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: JAPAN'S DEMOGRAPHICS, TRUMP'S SHIFT ON UKRAINE [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
The 2020s and Its Historic Shift: Japan’s Evolution [4]
Sept. 22, 2025
_Question: __What you did not address in this article was Japan’s demographic outlook with negative population growth. With more than 50 percent of their population over the age of 70, how will they
build a large enough defense force with the economy to support it? __ _
Response: There is no doubt that they have a demographic problem, but every advanced industrial country in the world has that problem based on significantly declining birth rates and extended life
expectancy. This will start hitting us hard by the end of this decade. I have written about both ends of the problem and argue that it will be solved by revolutions in medicine that make the elderly
net producers, and not net consumers. In the past the major economic problem was unemployment because of population growth outstripping economic growth. But these things can be compensated for, since
a declining population also means declining domestic consumption. Now, if I am right on the medical side (increasing length of life and at the same time extending productive life), we will all be
fine. The population explosion did not wreck us as was predicted, nor, in my view, will population decline, so long as net production is maintained at inflated prices.
-------------------------
_Question: It seems Japan and South Korea together, with their strong economies, would be able to help replace trade with China in the region. Japan’s per capita GDP is $32,475 and South Korea’s
is $33,120, compared to China’s $13,303._
Response: This is not impossible. The problem they have is that the products China sold the United States are not the same as South Korea and Japan produce now. Therefore, there would have to be much
capital expenditure to build new production systems, and there’s always the possibility that China will give in to American demands, leaving them high and dry. The question is can both countries
raise the massive capital required to shift the productive system around, based on the cost and risk. So while they could replace China, they would not do it fast, and the United States might invest
in its own domestic economy to replace China. I don’t think they will take the attendant risk.
-------------------------
RESPONSES TO OTHER QUESTIONS
_Question: Why doesn't Donald Trump pull the trigger and apply sanctions on Russia, and supply Ukraine with much greater military support?_
Response: Trump believed that Vladimir Putin would end the war and that an economic relationship could be achieved between the U.S. and Russia. It turned out that Putin couldn’t end the war because
of how little he had won at a massive cost in Russian lives and to the economy. I think that Trump finally realized this at the Alaska summit and he has now changed directions. He is now saying he
will back Ukraine to the point where they will retake their territory. I think at this point his read on Putin is that the only thing he fears is the humiliation of a three-and-a-half-year war and so
little to show for it. Trump seems to have concluded that the only thing Putin fears is military defeat, and so he has gone quiet on tariffs and is shifting his focus on the war.
-------------------------
_Question: __Russians drones over Poland, then Romania, now jets over Estonia. George, where is this going?_
Response: Planes and drones do go off course and these intrusions weren’t deep, but three this close in time is not a coincidence. Putin is desperate to show he got something out of this war. In his
view the Europeans are weaklings terrified of war. So by doing the intrusions, he wants to convince the Europeans that he might not wait for them to act, but might start a war himself. In my view, if
Russia couldn’t take Ukraine in three years, it can’t attack Europe. But when you’re deep in the pot and only have a busted flush, your next move is look confident and a hefty raise.
-------------------------
_Question: __Since most European countries (including Russia) are unable to raise an army to even protect themselves adequately, is it realistic that Putin would be fearing an attack from NATO or
other neighboring countries?_
Response: There are different kinds of realism. Russians remember that Hitler signed a treaty with Stalin at their request and arranged a coordinated invasion of Poland, with plans to split the
country. Hitler did everything he could to transmit that he respected Stalin and was very concerned about acting, as if he was too weak to invade Russia and never would. Stalin relaxed and Germany
invaded Russia. This is a lesson that Russia has been taught several times. The most dangerous enemies are those that appear weak and want Russia’s friendship. So Russian leaders have learned to
prepare for the worst-case scenario, as should we all. If Stalin can bet wrong on Hitler, then do not underestimate your enemy, ever. That’s the lesson the Russians learned.

 the end of this decade. I have written about both ends of the problem and =
argue that it will be solved by revolutions in medicine that make the elder=
ly net producers, and not net consumers. In the past the major economic pro=
blem was unemployment because of population growth outstripping economic gr=
owth. But these things can be compensated for, since a declining population=
 also means declining domestic consumption. Now, if I am right on the medic=
al side (increasing length of life and at the same time extending productiv=
e life), we will all be fine. The population explosion did not wreck us as =
was predicted, nor, in my view, will population decline, so long as net pro=
duction is maintained at inflated prices.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: It s=
eems Japan and South Korea together, with their strong economies, would be =
able to help replace trade with China in the region. Japan=E2=80=99s per ca=
pita GDP is $32,475 and South Korea=E2=80=99s is $33,120, compared to China=
=E2=80=99s $13,303.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: This is =
not impossible. The problem they have is that the products China sold the U=
nited States are not the same as South Korea and Japan produce now. Therefo=
re, there would have to be much capital expenditure to build new production=
 systems, and there=E2=80=99s always the possibility that China will give i=
n to American demands, leaving them high and dry. The question is can both =
countries raise the massive capital required to shift the productive system=
 around, based on the cost and risk. So while they could replace China, the=
y would not do it fast, and the United States might invest in its own domes=
tic economy to replace China. I don=E2=80=99t think they will take the atte=
ndant risk.</p>

to Other Questions</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Why =
doesn't Donald Trump pull the trigger and apply sanctions on Russia, and su=
pply Ukraine with much greater military support?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Trump be=
lieved that Vladimir Putin would end the war and that an economic relations=
hip could be achieved between the U.S. and Russia. It turned out that Putin=
 couldn=E2=80=99t end the war because of how little he had won at a massive=
 cost in Russian lives and to the economy. I think that Trump finally reali=
zed this at the Alaska summit and he has now changed directions. He is now =
saying he will back Ukraine to the point where they will retake their terri=
tory. I think at this point his read on Putin is that the only thing he fea=
rs is the humiliation of a three-and-a-half-year war and so little to show =
for it. Trump seems to have concluded that the only thing Putin fears is mi=
litary defeat, and so he has gone quiet on tariffs and is shifting his focu=
s on the war.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>Russians drones over Poland, then Romania, now jets over Estonia. Geor=
ge, where is this going?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Planes a=
nd drones do go off course and these intrusions weren=E2=80=99t deep, but t=
hree this close in time is not a coincidence. Putin is desperate to show he=
 got something out of this war. In his view the Europeans are weaklings ter=
rified of war. So by doing the intrusions, he wants to convince the Europea=
ns that he might not wait for them to act, but might start a war himself. I=
n my view, if Russia couldn=E2=80=99t take Ukraine in three years, it can=
=E2=80=99t attack Europe. But when you=E2=80=99re deep in the pot and only =
have a busted flush, your next move is look confident and a hefty raise.</p=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>Since most European countries (including Russia) are unable to raise a=
n army to even protect themselves adequately, is it realistic that Putin wo=
uld be fearing an attack from NATO or other neighboring countries?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: There ar=
e different kinds of realism. Russians remember that Hitler signed a treaty=
 with Stalin at their request and arranged a coordinated invasion of Poland=
, with plans to split the country. Hitler did everything he could to transm=
it that he respected Stalin and was very concerned about acting, as if he w=
as too weak to invade Russia and never would. Stalin relaxed and Germany in=
vaded Russia. This is a lesson that Russia has been taught several times. T=
he most dangerous enemies are those that appear weak and want Russia=E2=80=
=99s friendship. So Russian leaders have learned to prepare for the worst-c=
ase scenario, as should we all. If Stalin can bet wrong on Hitler, then do =
not underestimate your enemy, ever. That=E2=80=99s the lesson the Russians =
learned.</p>
