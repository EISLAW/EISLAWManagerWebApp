THE US IN THE SOUTH CAUCASUS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR EURASIA [3]
THE IMPORTANCE OF A RECENT PEACE AGREEMENT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
The peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia is among the most geopolitically consequential developments of our time. The South Caucasus region connects the West with the heart of Eurasia, so
Washington’s involvement in ending the standoff was both urgent and crucial: Having improved ties with Azerbaijan places Washington in a strategically advantageous position with regard to Russia and
Iran, and it could counter, if not curb, China’s influence in Central Asia.
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had made progress toward a peace deal in March, but it wasn’t until last week at the White House that they made things
official by signing the accord. According to the agreement, Washington will administer the Zangezur corridor, now called the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or TRIPP, which runs
through southern Armenia along its border with Iran, connecting Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan. Yerevan gave Washington exclusive development rights in a 99-year lease to the corridor, which
will be subleased to a consortium that will develop rail, oil, gas and fiber optic lines and possibly electricity transmission.

Though a number of steps remain before the peace agreement is finalized, the significance of America’s entry into the process cannot be overstated. The U.S. has now gained a major foothold in the
land bridge between the Black and the Caspian seas, a region that has been in Russia’s sphere of influence for two centuries. Moscow’s grip over this region began to slip well before the Kremlin
got bogged down in the war in Ukraine. The first major sign of this was apparent when Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, defeated Armenia in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and thus regained control over the
disputed territory after nearly 30 years.
Armenia's and Azerbaijan's relations with Russia have degraded ever since. Russia’s inability to help Armenia in the conflict, despite having a significant military presence in the country, made
Yerevan turn to Washington to secure its long-term interests. Azerbaijan’s ties to the U.S. have meanwhile improved as relations soured with Russia over its downing of a civilian airline last
December. The peace agreement, then, illustrates how Washington has taken advantage of this situation. Crucially, it was signed a week before U.S. President Donald Trump is slated to meet with Russian
President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
Though weakened, Russia still has the upper hand in neighboring Georgia and thus is still a force to contend with in the South Caucasus. But the headline here is that the U.S. (in league with Turkey)
has strategically positioned itself for the long term along Moscow’s southern flank. The development and long-term management of TRIPP cannot happen without a robust U.S. security presence in the
South Caucasus.
Russia isn’t the only one concerned about the development. If anything, Iran is more worried than anyone. TRIPP will run the entire length of Iran’s border with Armenia. And Azerbaijan’s
emergence as the dominant power in the South Caucasus is a threat to Iran. A quarter of all Iranians are ethnic Azeris, concentrated in the three northwestern provinces of Ardebil (bordering
Azerbaijan), East Azerbaijan (bordering Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nakhchivan) and West Azerbaijan (bordering Nakhchivan and Turkey).
More, as a trans-Caspian nation, Iran views the rise of Turkish influence with alarm. The South Caucasus, which extends into northwestern Iran, has been a key historical battleground between Turks and
Persians for more than a millennium. The situation became all the more acute after Iran lost Syria to Turkey when the Assad regime fell last December. And after the 12-day war with Israel, Tehran
feels all the more vulnerable in its northwest, given Baku’s close ties with Jerusalem.
Armenia's agreement to pursue the TRIPP plan thus exacerbates matters for Iran. A long-term U.S. presence in the South Caucasus will allow Washington a hub to potentially shape the Islamic Republic,
which is in the throes of a historic domestic political transition. The weakening of the theocrats, led by octogenarian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and their radical allies in the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps has given the regular armed forces and their more pragmatic civilian allies more sway in Iranian politics. It’s unclear how their struggle will play out, but U.S.
involvement in a major geoeconomic artery on Iran’s northern border gives Washington an opportunity to influence Tehran for decades.
In time, TRIPP can also allow the U.S. to expand its influence east of the Caspian Sea. Central Asia represents the one region of the world where U.S. influence has historically been the weakest. By
the time the U.S. became a superpower after World War II, the region was firmly under the control of the Soviet Union. It remained under Russian influence after the Soviet collapse. And given
Washington’s enmity with Iran, the U.S. had no point of access to Central Asia – not even when it was more or less occupying Afghanistan.
China, on the other hand, has steadily made inroads into Central Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative for the better part of a decade. It has invested heavily in mining, energy, infrastructure,
telecommunications and soft power projects in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. In short, Beijing has at least partially filled the vacuum left by Russia’s departure.
In May 2023, for example, it launched the China-Central Asia Summit, a diplomatic forum that for now is held biennially.
President Xi Jinping hosted his counterparts from all five Central Asian nations for the inaugural meeting in the north-central Chinese city of Xian. (The second summit was held in Kazakhstan in
June.) China has prioritized unimpeded trade, industrial investment, regional connectivity, green minerals, agricultural modernization and people-to-people exchanges with the region. Efforts to link
the region with western China via the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, also known as the Middle Corridor, are ongoing.
The signing of the TRIPP deal is nothing less than the decongestion of a crucial chokepoint. China still has the geographic advantage in the region, so it will still likely have the upper hand there
for the foreseeable future – that is, unless Washington and Moscow reach an understanding on Ukraine that gives Russia the time it needs to regain its footing. Either way, U.S. involvement in the
South Caucasus is a significant opportunity.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia is among the most geopolitically consequential developments of our time. The South Caucasus region connects the West with the heart of Eurasia, so Washington’s involvement in ending the standoff was both urgent and crucial: Having improved ties with Azerbaijan places Washington in a strategically advantageous position with regard to Russia and Iran, and it could counter, if not curb, China’s influence in Central Asia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had made progress toward a peace deal in March, but it wasn’t until last week at the White House that they made things official by signing the accord. According to the agreement, Washington will administer the Zangezur corridor, now called the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or TRIPP, which runs through southern Armenia along its border with Iran, connecting Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan. Yerevan gave Washington exclusive development rights in a 99-year lease to the corridor, which will be subleased to a consortium that will develop rail, oil, gas and fiber optic lines and possibly electricity transmission.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Though a number of steps remain before the peace agreement is finalized, the significance of America’s entry into the process cannot be overstated. The U.S. has now gained a major foothold in the land bridge between the Black and the Caspian seas, a region that has been in Russia’s sphere of influence for two centuries. Moscow’s grip over this region began to slip well before the Kremlin got bogged down in the war in Ukraine. The first major sign of this was apparent when Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, defeated Armenia in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and thus regained control over the disputed territory after nearly 30 years.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Armenia's and Azerbaijan's relations with Russia have degraded ever since. Russia’s inability to help Armenia in the conflict, despite having a significant military presence in the country, made Yerevan turn to Washington to secure its long-term interests. Azerbaijan’s ties to the U.S. have meanwhile improved as relations soured with Russia over its downing of a civilian airline last December. The peace agreement, then, illustrates how Washington has taken advantage of this situation. Crucially, it was signed a week before U.S. President Donald Trump is slated to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Though weakened, Russia still has the upper hand in neighboring Georgia and thus is still a force to contend with in the South Caucasus. But the headline here is that the U.S. (in league with Turkey) has strategically positioned itself for the long term along Moscow’s southern flank. The development and long-term management of TRIPP cannot happen without a robust U.S. security presence in the South Caucasus.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia isn’t the only one concerned about the development. If anything, Iran is more worried than anyone. TRIPP will run the entire length of Iran’s border with Armenia. And Azerbaijan’s emergence as the dominant power in the South Caucasus is a threat to Iran. A quarter of all Iranians are ethnic Azeris, concentrated in the three northwestern provinces of Ardebil (bordering Azerbaijan), East Azerbaijan (bordering Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nakhchivan) and West Azerbaijan (bordering Nakhchivan and Turkey).</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">More, as a trans-Caspian nation, Iran views the rise of Turkish influence with alarm. The South Caucasus, which extends into northwestern Iran, has been a key historical battleground between Turks and Persians for more than a millennium. The situation became all the more acute after Iran lost Syria to Turkey when the Assad regime fell last December. And after the 12-day war with Israel, Tehran feels all the more vulnerable in its northwest, given Baku’s close ties with Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Armenia's agreement to pursue the TRIPP plan thus exacerbates matters for Iran. A long-term U.S. presence in the South Caucasus will allow Washington a hub to potentially shape the Islamic Republic, which is in the throes of a historic domestic political transition. The weakening of the theocrats, led by octogenarian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and their radical allies in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has given the regular armed forces and their more pragmatic civilian allies more sway in Iranian politics. It’s unclear how their struggle will play out, but U.S. involvement in a major geoeconomic artery on Iran’s northern border gives Washington an opportunity to influence Tehran for decades.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In time, TRIPP can also allow the U.S. to expand its influence east of the Caspian Sea. Central Asia represents the one region of the world where U.S. influence has historically been the weakest. By the time the U.S. became a superpower after World War II, the region was firmly under the control of the Soviet Union. It remained under Russian influence after the Soviet collapse. And given Washington’s enmity with Iran, the U.S. had no point of access to Central Asia – not even when it was more or less occupying Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">China, on the other hand, has steadily made inroads into Central Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative for the better part of a decade. It has invested heavily in mining, energy, infrastructure, telecommunications and soft power projects in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. In short, Beijing has at least partially filled the vacuum left by Russia’s departure. In May 2023, for example, it launched the China-Central Asia Summit, a diplomatic forum that for now is held biennially.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">President Xi Jinping hosted his counterparts from all five Central Asian nations for the inaugural meeting in the north-central Chinese city of Xian. (The second summit was held in Kazakhstan in June.) China has prioritized unimpeded trade, industrial investment, regional connectivity, green minerals, agricultural modernization and people-to-people exchanges with the region. Efforts to link the region with western China via the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, also known as the Middle Corridor, are ongoing.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The signing of the TRIPP deal is nothing less than the decongestion of a crucial chokepoint. China still has the geographic advantage in the region, so it will still likely have the upper hand there for the foreseeable future – that is, unless Washington and Moscow reach an understanding on Ukraine that gives Russia the time it needs to regain its footing. Either way, U.S. involvement in the South Caucasus is a significant opportunity.</p>
