The researchers address the challenge of training Large Language Model (LLM=
) based agents to robustly call functions (e.g. use tools/APIs) across dive=
rse scenarios. They propose AgentScaler, a framework that automatically gen=
erates a wide range of simulated environments to broaden the agent=E2=80=99=
s experience space. A two-phase training regimen is used: first imparting f=
undamental tool-use skills, then fine-tuning on domain-specific scenarios. =
Notable aspects and results include:
Scalable Heterogeneous Environments: The system constructs 1,000+ distinct =
domains of fully simulated tools (modeled as database operations) to expose=
 the agent to varied function-calling scenarios. Tools are instantiated as =
code with verifiable outcomes, ensuring the agent learns grounded interacti=
ons. This principled environment expansion addresses the gap in diverse tra=
ining data for tool use.
Two-Stage Agent Fine-Tuning: Agents are first trained on general tool-use s=
kills via simulated human-agent interactions (yielding a broad, filtered ex=
perience dataset), then further specialized in vertical domains for context=
-specific expertise. This =E2=80=9Cgeneralist-to-specialist=E2=80=9D approa=
ch yielded smoother training of agentic capabilities.
State-of-the-Art Performance: The largest model, AgentScaler-30B, achieved =
state-of-the-art results on agentic benchmarks (=CF=84-Bench, =CF=842-Bench=
, ACEBench). Remarkably, AgentScaler-30B=E2=80=99s function-calling perform=
ance is on par with proprietary 1-trillion-parameter agents, despite using =
far fewer parameters. This demonstrates that scaling environment diversity =
and targeted training can dramatically boost an agent=E2=80=99s tool-use pr=
oficiency.
Scaling Agents via Continual Pre-training (paper [ https://substack.com/red=

There=E2=80=99s a bottleneck in current open-source AI agents: they rely on=
 general LLMs that weren=E2=80=99t explicitly trained for multi-step tool u=
se, causing optimization conflicts during fine-tuning on agent tasks. To fi=
x this, the authors introduce Agentic Continual Pre-Training (CPT) as an ad=
ditional stage to produce a strong agent-focused foundation model before su=
pervised or RL finetuning. They develop AgentFounder, a 30B-parameter LLM p=
re-trained on synthetic agent experiences, and report impressive results:
Agentic CPT Pipeline: By continually pre-training on large-scale synthetic =
agent data (generated via a data flywheel of tool-use records, knowledge, a=
nd Q&A pairs), the model acquires a broad capacity for reasoning and tool i=
nteraction prior to fine-tuning. This mitigates the =E2=80=9Ctug-of-war=E2=
=80=9D where models previously had to learn tool use and align to demonstra=
tions simultaneously.
AgentFounder Model: The resulting AgentFounder-30B is a powerful agentic fo=
undation model. It retains strong tool-usage skills and, after light task-s=
pecific tuning, achieves state-of-the-art on 10 different agent benchmarks.=
 For example, it scores 39.9% on the BrowseComp-English web search benchmar=
k, 43.3% on BrowseComp-Chinese, and 31.5% Pass@1 on the challenging =E2=80=
=9CHumanity=E2=80=99s Last Exam=E2=80=9D (HLE) reasoning test.
Significance: This work demonstrates that adding a focused pre-training sta=
ge for agent behavior yields substantial gains. Open-source agent models ca=
n now rival or surpass proprietary agents on complex tool-using tasks, high=
lighting the importance of specialized continual pre-training for autonomou=
s AI agents.

The researchers tackle a data scarcity problem in 4D world modeling =E2=80=
=93 learning representations that capture 3D space and temporal dynamics to=
gether (think of tasks like reconstructing scenes over time or predicting f=
uture video frames). They introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale dataset spanni=
ng multiple domains and modalities to support training and evaluating 4D wo=
rld models. Key features and findings:
Comprehensive 4D Dataset: OmniWorld consists of a newly created OmniWorld-G=
ame simulation dataset plus several curated public datasets, together cover=
ing diverse domains (indoor scenes, outdoor environments, etc.). OmniWorld-=
Game is notably rich in modalities (e.g. RGB video, depth, events) and feat=
ures realistic, dynamic interactions, exceeding prior synthetic datasets in=
 scale and complexity.
Benchmarking 4D Modeling: Using OmniWorld, the authors define challenging b=
enchmarks for tasks like 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, an=
d camera-control video generation. These benchmarks reveal that many curren=
t state-of-the-art models struggle with the dataset=E2=80=99s complex, dyna=
mic scenarios =E2=80=93 highlighting gaps in generalization when confronted=
 with OmniWorld=E2=80=99s multi-domain, time-evolving content.
Performance Gains with OmniWorld: Fine-tuning existing SOTA models on OmniW=
orld led to significant improvements on 4D tasks (better reconstruction acc=
uracy, more coherent video generation). This validates OmniWorld as a valua=
ble training resource: exposure to its varied and rich data helps models be=
tter grasp physical world dynamics. The authors envision OmniWorld will acc=
elerate progress toward general-purpose 4D world models that understand our=
 dynamic physical world in all its complexity.

QuantAgent is a new application of LLM-based agents to high-frequency tradi=
ng (HFT). Unlike typical financial LLM setups that analyze long-term fundam=
entals or news, HFT requires split-second, short-horizon decisions based on=
 technical price signals. QuantAgent meets this need by deploying multiple =
specialized LLM agents, each focusing on a different aspect of market data,=
 to collaboratively make trading decisions. Highlights:
Four Specialized Agents: The system breaks down the trading task into four =
expert LLM agents =E2=80=93 Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk. Each agent=
 is equipped with domain-specific tools (e.g. analyzing technical indicator=
s, chart pattern recognition, detecting short-term trends, risk management)=
 and uses structured reasoning suited to its specialty. This modular design=
 mirrors how human trading firms have different desks or algorithms for dif=
ferent strategies.
Real-Time, Short-Horizon Focus: By concentrating on structured short-term s=
ignals (like price patterns, indicator thresholds) rather than long textual=
 analysis, QuantAgent can operate within 4-hour trading windows or shorter.=
 This price-driven approach is tailor-made for HFT=E2=80=99s precision and =
speed demands =E2=80=93 a departure from prior LLM trading agents that were=
n=E2=80=99t optimized for sub-day frequencies.
Outperformance in Zero-Shot Trading: In zero-shot evaluation on 10 differen=
t financial instruments (including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures), QuantAgent =
outperformed strong baselines (both neural and rule-based) in predictive ac=
curacy and cumulative returns. Its multi-agent architecture yielded better =
trading decisions than single-LLM or random strategies, showing the benefit=
 of combining structured financial priors with language-model reasoning. Th=
ese results suggest LLM agents, when properly structured, can deliver trace=
able, real-time decisions in high-speed financial markets.
Is In-Context Learning Learning? (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e42=

Here=E2=80=99s an intriguing question: when an LLM performs in-context lear=
ning (ICL) =E2=80=93 i.e. adapting to a new task via a prompt with a few ex=
amples, without updating weights =E2=80=93 is it truly learning or just lev=
eraging prior knowledge? The paper combines theoretical discussion and an e=
xtensive empirical analysis (nearly 1.9 million trials) to characterize ICL=
=2E Key insights include:
ICL as Implicit Learning: The author argues that mathematically, ICL can be=
 viewed as a form of learning because the model=E2=80=99s outputs change in=
 response to labeled examples in the context (it=E2=80=99s updating its fun=
ction implicitly via the prompt). However, unlike standard learning, the mo=
del does not permanently encode new information; it =E2=80=9Clearns=E2=80=
=9D transiently from context and heavily relies on its pretrained priors.
Empirical Limitations: Large-scale experiments (ablating memorization effec=
ts, controlling prompt distributions and phrasings) show that ICL is effect=
ive but quite limited in generalizing to truly unseen tasks. Often, the mod=
el is picking up on statistical regularities in the prompt rather than acqu=
iring a deep new skill. For example, when numerous exemplars are given, the=
 model=E2=80=99s accuracy becomes insensitive to prompt format or even whic=
h model is used, and instead hinges on patterns in the example distribution=
=2E This leads to brittleness =E2=80=93 e.=
g. chain-of-thought style prompts c=
an induce distributional quirks that hurt generalization.
Conclusion =E2=80=93 Not Quite =E2=80=9CLearning=E2=80=9D Like Humans: Give=
n the above, the paper concludes that ICL=E2=80=99s mechanism (next-token p=
rediction with an ad-hoc context encoding) is not a robust, general-purpose=
 learning method. Two tasks that look formally similar may see very differe=
nt ICL performance, indicating the model hasn=E2=80=99t truly learned an ab=
stract rule. In short, ICL works within limits, but it=E2=80=99s no substit=
ute for true learning (where the model=E2=80=99s parameters update to captu=
re new concepts). This nuanced finding tempers expectations about prompting=
 alone solving novel problems.

This work focuses on improving =E2=80=9Cdeep search=E2=80=9D AI agents =E2=
=80=93 LLM-based agents that browse the web or knowledge bases to answer co=
mplex queries. Existing open-source agents struggle with long-horizon reaso=
ning (handling multi-step search sessions) and often lack training data for=
 truly hard queries. The DeepDive framework tackles both issues via synthet=
ic data generation and reinforcement learning, yielding an agent that sets =
new records in open-domain web search tasks:
Synthetic Complex Query Generation: DeepDive automatically synthesizes diff=
icult, multi-hop questions using open knowledge graphs. By traversing knowl=
edge graph connections, it creates queries that require the agent to perfor=
m multi-step reasoning and find =E2=80=9Chard-to-discover=E2=80=9D informat=
ion. This provides a large training corpus of challenging search tasks beyo=
nd what existing supervised data offers.
Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning: Rather than rely solely on imitation lea=
rning, DeepDive applies end-to-end RL across multi-turn search sessions. Th=
e 32B-parameter agent is trained via reinforcement feedback to plan searche=
s, utilize tools (like web browsers), and gather information over many turn=
s =E2=80=93 effectively learning to extend its reasoning horizon. This RL f=
ine-tuning markedly improved the agent=E2=80=99s ability to handle complex =
information-seeking dialogues.
State-of-the-Art Results: The trained DeepDive-32B agent achieves a new ope=
n-source state-of-the-art on the BrowseComp benchmark (a suite of complex w=
eb queries). It outperforms previous open agents such as WebSailor and Deep=
Seek on these tasks. Notably, ablations show that the multi-turn RL trainin=
g contributed significantly to the gains, demonstrating the value of traini=
ng agents with actual search trajectories and feedback. DeepDive also enabl=
es practical enhancements like at test-time the agent can perform more tool=
 calls in parallel to gather information efficiently. The code, models, and=
 data are released, providing a foundation for future =E2=80=9Cdeep search=
=E2=80=9D agent development.
Understanding Outer Optimizers in Local SGD: Learning Rates, Momentum, and =
Acceleration (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/ac955cb1-0cf4-461a-bfae=

Ahmed Khaled et al. delve into the theory of Local SGD, a distributed train=
ing technique where multiple nodes perform local gradient steps and periodi=
cally synchronize. They focus on the often overlooked outer optimizer =E2=
=80=93 the update rule applied when aggregating models from different nodes=
=2E While much research optimizes the l=
ocal (inner) SGD settings, this work s=
tudies how the outer learning rate, momentum, etc., affect convergence. Maj=
or findings and contributions:
Role of Outer Learning Rate: The authors prove that tuning the outer-loop l=
earning rate is crucial. A higher outer LR can amplify updates from the ave=
rage of local models, whereas a lower LR dampens them. They show one can tr=
ade off final optimization error vs. noise from stochastic gradients by adj=
usting this LR. Interestingly, their theory suggests optimal outer LR can s=
ometimes exceed 1.0 (i.e. overshooting the plain average) to counteract slo=
w convergence or suboptimal inner settings. Moreover, a well-chosen outer L=
R can compensate for a poorly tuned inner LR =E2=80=93 essentially correcti=
ng some mistakes made in local training.
Momentum and Acceleration in Outer Loop: Extending the analysis, they incor=
porate momentum in the outer optimizer and define an effective =E2=80=9Cmom=
entum-adjusted=E2=80=9D learning rate. The benefits are analogous: proper t=
uning of outer momentum can further smooth and accelerate convergence. They=
 also examine Nesterov acceleration applied in the outer loop, proving that=
 it improves convergence speed with respect to communication rounds. This i=
s notable because prior accelerated schemes focused on local updates; accel=
erating the global updates yields better theoretical rates than purely loca=
l acceleration.
Data-Dependent Insights & Empirical Validation: The paper provides a novel =
data-dependent convergence analysis for Local SGD, offering practical guida=
nce on setting the outer LR based on properties like data heterogeneity. Fi=
nally, experiments training standard language models across distributed nod=
es confirm the theoretical predictions. For instance, using a larger-than-1=
 outer LR or adding outer momentum matched the expected improvements in con=
vergence speed and final accuracy, validating that careful outer optimizer =
design can significantly enhance distributed training efficiency.
Wrap-Up
From the first two works, we see a concerted push to build more general and=
 capable agents by scaling up their training environments and pre-training =
regimes =E2=80=93 enabling smaller open models to match the performance of =
massive closed models in complex, tool-using tasks. In parallel, the OmniWo=
rld dataset underscores the importance of rich, diverse data for domains li=
ke 4D vision, where broader training data can unlock significant gains. We =
also witness LLMs being adapted to specialized domains: QuantAgent=E2=80=99=
s success in high-frequency trading shows that with domain-specific structu=
ring, LLMs can handle real-time, high-stakes applications.
On the more fundamental side, research like =E2=80=9CIs In-Context Learning=
 Learning?=E2=80=9D deepens our understanding of how models learn (or fail =
to) from context, guiding us on the limits of prompt-based =E2=80=9Clearnin=
g=E2=80=9D. Enhancements in agent architectures (DeepDive) demonstrate the =
value of combining knowledge graphs and reinforcement learning to tackle lo=
ng-horizon reasoning. Finally, theoretical breakthroughs in distributed opt=
imization (outer optimizers for Local SGD) provide principled ways to speed=
 up training on large-scale data. Together, this illustrates that advances =
in data, algorithms, and theory are converging to create more capable, effi=
cient, and insightful AI systems. Each contributes a piece to the puzzle of=
 building AI that is not only more powerful, but also better understood.

 trading (HFT)</strong><span>. Unlike typical financial LLM setups that ana=
lyze long-term fundamentals or news, HFT requires split-second, short-horiz=

each focusing on a different aspect of market data, to collaboratively make=
 trading decisions. Highlights:</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=

d </span><strong>Risk</strong><span>. Each agent is equipped with </span><e=
m>domain-specific tools</em><span> (e.g. analyzing technical indicators, ch=

uses structured reasoning suited to its specialty. This modular design mirr=

an long textual analysis, QuantAgent can operate within </span><strong>4-ho=

-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>Here=E2=80=99s an intriguing question=
: when an LLM performs </span><strong>in-context learning (ICL)</strong><sp=
an> =E2=80=93 i.e. adapting to a new task via a prompt with a few examples,=
 without updating weights =E2=80=93 is it truly </span><em>learning</em><sp=
an> or just leveraging prior knowledge? The paper combines theoretical disc=
ussion and an extensive empirical analysis (nearly 1.9 million trials) to c=
haracterize ICL. Key insights include:</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>ICL a=
s Implicit Learning:</strong><span> The author argues that </span><strong>m=
athematically, ICL </strong><em><strong>can</strong></em><strong> be viewed=
 as a form of learning</strong><span> because the model=E2=80=99s outputs c=
hange in response to labeled examples in the context (it=E2=80=99s updating=
 its function implicitly via the prompt). However, unlike standard learning=
, the model does not permanently encode new information; it =E2=80=9Clearns=
=E2=80=9D transiently from context and heavily relies on its pretrained pri=
ors.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Empirical Limitations:</strong><span> L=
arge-scale experiments (ablating memorization effects, controlling prompt d=
istributions and phrasings) show that </span><strong>ICL is effective but q=
uite limited</strong><span> in generalizing to truly unseen tasks. Often, t=
he model is picking up on </span><em>statistical regularities in the prompt=
</em><span> rather than acquiring a deep new skill. For example, when numer=
ous exemplars are given, the model=E2=80=99s accuracy becomes </span><em>in=
sensitive to prompt format or even which model is used</em><span>, and inst=
ead hinges on patterns in the example distribution. This leads to brittlene=
ss =E2=80=93 e.g. chain-of-thought style prompts can induce distributional =
quirks that hurt generalization.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=

=E2=80=93 Not Quite =E2=80=9CLearning=E2=80=9D Like Humans:</strong><span> =
Given the above, the paper concludes that </span><strong>ICL=E2=80=99s mech=
anism (next-token prediction with an ad-hoc context encoding) is not a robu=
st, general-purpose learning method</strong><span>. Two tasks that look for=
mally similar may see very different ICL performance, indicating the model =
hasn=E2=80=99t truly learned an abstract rule. In short, ICL works within l=
imits, but it=E2=80=99s </span><em>no substitute for true learning</em><spa=
n> (where the model=E2=80=99s parameters update to capture new concepts). T=
his nuanced finding tempers expectations about prompting alone solving nove=

n> delve into the theory of </span><strong>Local SGD</strong><span>, a dist=
ributed training technique where multiple nodes perform local gradient step=
s and periodically synchronize. They focus on the often overlooked </span><=
strong>outer optimizer</strong><span> =E2=80=93 the update rule applied whe=
n aggregating models from different nodes. While much research optimizes th=
e local (inner) SGD settings, this work studies how the </span><em>outer</e=
m><span> learning rate, momentum, etc., affect convergence. Major findings =
and contributions:</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Role of Outer Learning Ra=
te:</strong><span> The authors prove that tuning the </span><strong>outer-l=
oop learning rate</strong><span> is crucial. A higher outer LR can amplify =
updates from the average of local models, whereas a lower LR dampens them. =
They show one can </span><strong>trade off final optimization error vs. noi=
se</strong><span> from stochastic gradients by adjusting this LR. Interesti=
ngly, their theory suggests </span><strong>optimal outer LR can sometimes e=
xceed 1.0</strong><span> (i.e. overshooting the plain average) to counterac=
t slow convergence or suboptimal inner settings. Moreover, a well-chosen ou=
ter LR can </span><strong>compensate for a poorly tuned inner LR</strong><s=
pan> =E2=80=93 essentially correcting some mistakes made in local training.=
</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Momentum and Acceleration in Outer Loop:</s=
trong><span> Extending the analysis, they incorporate </span><strong>moment=
um</strong><span> in the outer optimizer and define an effective =E2=80=9Cm=
omentum-adjusted=E2=80=9D learning rate. The benefits are analogous: proper=
 tuning of outer momentum can further smooth and accelerate convergence. Th=
ey also examine </span><strong>Nesterov acceleration applied in the outer l=
oop</strong><span>, proving that it </span><strong>improves convergence spe=
ed with respect to communication rounds</strong><span>. This is notable bec=
ause prior accelerated schemes focused on local updates; accelerating the g=
lobal updates yields better theoretical rates than purely local acceleratio=
n.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Data-Dependent Insights &amp; Empirical V=
alidation:</strong><span> The paper provides a </span><strong>novel data-de=
pendent convergence analysis</strong><span> for Local SGD, offering practic=
al guidance on setting the outer LR based on properties like data heterogen=
eity. Finally, experiments training standard language models across distrib=
uted nodes confirm the theoretical predictions. For instance, using a large=
r-than-1 outer LR or adding outer momentum matched the expected improvement=
s in convergence speed and final accuracy, validating that careful outer op=
timizer design can </span><em>significantly enhance distributed training ef=
ficiency</em><span>.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"po=
