DAILY MEMO: ISRAEL'S STRIKE IN QATAR AND THE REGIONAL FALLOUT [3]
DOHA IS NOW RECONSIDERING ITS EFFORTS TO BROKER PEACE IN GAZA.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
TARGETING HAMAS. Israel on Tuesday carried out an attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar. The strike involved 15 fighter jets launching 10 munitions against a single target – the Hamas headquarters in
Doha. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said [4] the strike was in retaliation for a deadly shooting at a Jerusalem bus stop on Monday. Hamas said [5] the attack failed to kill its top
leadership but did assassinate five lower-level members. In response, Qatar has suspended [6] its mediation role in ceasefire talks over Gaza. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani
called the attack [7] an act of “state terrorism.” Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani discussed the strike in separate calls with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [8] and U.S. President
Donald Trump [9]. Trump said he was “very unhappy” about the situation and called Qatar a “strong ally and friend.”
RAISING ALARMS. The Turkiye Gazetesi newspaper, meanwhile, reported [10] that Turkish intelligence agency MIT warned Hamas officials in Qatar of a possible Israeli attack ahead of the strike. This
warning was the reason the Hamas leadership escaped alive, according to the report. Egypt, another mediator in the ceasefire talks, also discussed over the past two weeks with Hamas officials the
possibility of an Israeli strike on the group’s leadership abroad. Still, both Doha and Cairo were “shocked” by the incident, Al Akhbar newspaper reported [11].
UNITY. Several regional leaders are now heading to Qatar in a show of solidarity. UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan arrived [12] in Doha on Wednesday, while Jordan’s Crown Prince
Hussein is expected to travel there later in the day. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to arrive on Thursday.
RUSSIAN INCURSION. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused [13] Russia of violating Polish airspace with 19 drone incursions overnight. NATO and Polish jets shot down at least three of them, the
first time Russian drones were downed in a NATO member state since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On Wednesday, Poland invoked [14] Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which allows for
consultations among NATO countries when a member believes its territorial integrity or security is threatened.
RUSSIAN SHORTAGES. More than 10 Russian regions are reporting gasoline shortages, according to the Izvestia newspaper [15]. Supply disruptions were previously observed in the Far East and Saratov
regions, but independent gas stations in several other areas are now also saying they have not received supplies from refineries for several weeks, forcing some to temporarily close.
GROWING DISRUPTION. The so-called Gen Z protests in Nepal have expanded [16] to all seven provinces in the country. Amid the demonstrations, provincial parliament buildings, government ministries,
court offices and police departments have been set on fire. According to Nepalese media, the arson attacks have paralyzed provincial government offices, disrupted the judiciary, and halted revenue and
customs services in many areas. Security forces have been deployed across the country. India has placed security along its border with Nepal on high alert [17].
FINALLY. Ethiopia inaugurated [18] the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on Tuesday, after 14 years of construction. Both Sudan and Egypt have long objected to the project, which is now Africa’s
largest hydroelectric dam, over concerns it could infringe on their access to Nile water flows. Other neighbors, including Somalia, South Sudan and Kenya, celebrated the opening, hoping they could
benefit from electricity exports.
RESTARTING DIALOGUE. Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency director reached [19] an agreement to resume cooperation following a meeting between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi. Araghchi clarified [20], however, that the deal does not grant access to Iranian nuclear facilities for IAEA inspectors, saying inspections would be discussed “in due
course.”
RUSSIA AND SYRIA. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak arrived [21] in Damascus for talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani. They discussed security, economics and energy. Novak
also met [22] with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to talk about strengthening cooperation and bilateral relations in various areas.
ENERGY COOPERATION. Algeria invited [23] Russian companies to bid for contracts for oil and gas development projects during a meeting between Russia’s deputy energy minister and Algeria’s minister
of energy. The two officials also agreed to coordinate efforts to protect the interests of hydrocarbon-exporting states in global energy markets.
TRADE AND MORE. Turkey and Pakistan signed [24] a cooperation agreement covering trade, energy, investment, transport and logistics. They also confirmed their intention to increase bilateral trade to
$5 billion. In addition, the Turkish defense minister announced that three more MILGEM-class corvettes would soon be transferred to Pakistan.
FIRST DRILLS. Russia, China and Mongolia held [25] their first-ever trilateral military exercises in their shared border regions this week. The drills were focused on countering terrorism and sabotage
operations in the area.
