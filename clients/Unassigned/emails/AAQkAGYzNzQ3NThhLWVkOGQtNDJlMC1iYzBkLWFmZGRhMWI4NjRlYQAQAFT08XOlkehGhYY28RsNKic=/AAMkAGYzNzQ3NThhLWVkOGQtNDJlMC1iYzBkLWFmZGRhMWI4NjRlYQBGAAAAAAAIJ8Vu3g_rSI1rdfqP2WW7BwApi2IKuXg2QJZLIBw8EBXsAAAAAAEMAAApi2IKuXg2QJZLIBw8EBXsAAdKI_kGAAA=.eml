June 16=2C 2025

Question: What are the pros and cons for Israel of circulating that they c=
ould have killed Ali Khamenei? What would be the pros and cons for Israel=
 of actually killing him?

Response: Wars end either in the total destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s=
 army and occupation of its country=2C or in negotiations. Israel may be a=
ble to deeply damage Iran=E2=80=99s military but not render it unable to r=
esist to some degree. Israel cannot invade and occupy Iran=2C given the di=
stance between them and Iran=E2=80=99s massive size. So the war will end i=
n negotiations. For there to be negotiations=2C there has to be someone to=
 negotiate with. Hence=2C keeping Khamenei alive makes him the negotiator=
 =E2=80=93 and a weak one. Khamenei has lost many of his subordinates and=
 his Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is deeply diminished=2C while the l=
arge conventional army=2C hostile to the IRGC=2C remains intact.

At the moment=2C he is the only leader who can legitimately negotiate on T=
ehran=E2=80=99s behalf=2C and he is weak and vulnerable. So keeping him al=
ive may not necessarily help Israel=2C but it doesn=E2=80=99t hurt. Better=
 a weakened negotiator than his successor. So I would guess.
Comment: Russia is in a conundrum=2C as they know the U.S. is actively sup=
porting the Ukrainians. However=2C they can=E2=80=99t strike the U.S. or a=
nother NATO country without NATO then demonstrating what F-16s can do to t=
heir military dumps and drone centers=2C really embarrassing Russia. Decli=
ning powers are dangerous and perhaps there will be a resolution where Rus=
sia is given Crimea. The huge problem is that by doing so=2C we anger Roma=
nia and others because of nautical issues in the Black Sea involving any s=
ettlement that Russia will read very liberally.


Response: Crimea is now=2C in reality=2C Russian. Unless someone is able a=
nd willing to invade Crimea and take it from Russia=2C this is a reality c=
ountries like Romania must live with. The U.S. is not about to invade Crim=
ea=2C nor is Romania. So withholding recognition of this is politically sa=
tisfying to some=2C but does not change the reality. The question of contr=
ol of the Black Sea or air lanes does not have to be conceded=2C and in a=
 world of drones=2C if Russia tries to exert control over them it can be r=
esisted.

As for weakened countries being dangerous=2C I find them much less dangero=
us than powerful countries. True=2C a weakened country can undertake reckl=
ess action=2C but the likelihood of it succeeding is far more limited than=
 a thoughtful action from a powerful nation. The Russian seizure of Crimea=
 could have been resisted by countries in the region but=2C being weaker=
=2C they were prudent and did not resist. They would like the occupation r=
eversed=2C but it would take forces from throughout Europe and the United=
 States to conduct amphibious warfare. That is not going to happen because=
 the price even from a weakened Russia could be significant. So I do not s=
ee weakened countries as more dangerous than powerful ones. On the other h=
and=2C I don=E2=80=99t think that even powerful nations wish to pay the co=
st of trying to drive Russia out.
Comment/Question: It seems the Russians are hitting back by trying to take=
 more ground. They have=2C but it is a small amount. Perhaps they are test=
ing the European response. While not anticipating that Russia will invade=
 any NATO country=2C they have issues to the south and want to expand else=
where. It is confusing not only to us but in Russia. Can you explain Russi=
a=E2=80=99s behavior?

Response: The reason for Russia acting aggressively is not to test Europe=
=2C but to reverse the reality that Russia lost the war by not being able=
 to defeat Ukraine in short order. To have spent more than three years tak=
ing only a fraction of Ukraine represents a failure of an assumed great po=
wer. From this flows the idea that Russia has ceased to be a great power=
=2C or that Putin managed the war badly. Conceding either point would be e=
xtremely painful for Russia=E2=80=99s self-image and Putin=E2=80=99s credi=
bility. So they continue to fight the war in the hope that the fortunes mi=
ght shift either because Ukraine reached its limits or Ukraine=E2=80=99s a=
llies failed to support it. They misread Trump=E2=80=99s gestures of accom=
modation for an opening. Trump cannot afford to allow Russia to exploit hi=
s openness to a settlement by humiliating him. And the Europeans cannot af=
ford to admit their own inability to help Ukraine.

So the Russians took Trump as indifferent to Ukraine=2C and therefore indi=
fferent to Putin=E2=80=99s own reputation=2C and mistook European division=
 for an inability to act. Therefore=2C Putin chose to extend the war in th=
e hopes of reversing the perception of Russia and himself. But I believe h=
e simply amplified his initial error of overestimating Russian power=2C an=
d underestimating the resistance to his actions. The alternative is accept=
ing that Russia failed to defeat Ukraine and that Putin miscalculated.

June 6=2C 2025

Comment/Question: You mention in your report from Serbia that you continue=
 to believe the intervention in Serbia was "insane." I distinctly remember=
 you=2C at the time=2C questioning the pretext for invasion=2C in particul=
ar the situation in Kosovo. Can you expand on these observations and the s=
triking analytical outcome for people who haven't been listening to you fo=
r 26 years?

Response: The insanity was in the manner in which the United States respon=
ded to Serbia=E2=80=99s (or Yugoslavia=E2=80=99s) treatment of Kosovars. T=
heir choice of action was not to send sufficient troops into Kosovo to def=
eat the forces that were oppressing the Kosovars=2C but instead to wage an=
 extended bombing campaign on Belgrade=2C a city crowded with civilians. I=
t was assumed that the bombing of a large=2C crowded city would force Slob=
odan Milosevic=2C the leader of Yugoslavia=2C to capitulate and halt his a=
ctions in Kosovo. When Milosevic was not moved by the bombing=2C they cont=
inued=2C rather than act in the area where they claimed the atrocities wer=
e happening.

That was the insanity I was referring to: bombing an urban area filled wit=
h powerless civilians for more than two months=2C inflicting terror and de=
ath on a city=2C without solving the problem they were concerned with. Tha=
t in the end it worked did not justify its cost. I am far from a pacificis=
t=2C and I accept that war is part of the human condition=2C but continuin=
g a bombing campaign against civilians when it was clear that Milosevic wa=
s indifferent to its effects struck me as madness and needlessly cruel.

Comment/Question: You=E2=80=99re absolutely correct that immigration to Am=
erica should have always continued to follow a quota system. And the probl=
em we=E2=80=99re in now has very few good answers because the inflow of il=
legals was ultimately done on a drip by drip basis=2C and people are now p=
roposing on the far right that we try to mass deport 10+ million people=2C=
 which would sink the country.

The only thing that sounds viable is that everyone be given some sort of a=
mnesty for registering. If they=E2=80=99re found to be criminals=2C either=
 in their home country or here=2C they will be deported. Most people shoul=
d be told we=E2=80=99re not going to kick you out=2C you have to fully reg=
ister=2C and you=E2=80=99re gonna have a 10-year path to citizenship =E2=
=80=93 and by the way=2C you must learn English=2C which should=E2=80=99ve=
 been done from the beginning=2C huge mistake=E2=80=A6. then we know thing=
s will work out. But as you probably also know=2C we=E2=80=99re being led=
 primarily by a kakistocracy of very corrupt people.

Response: That is one way to do it=2C but first the fundamental reality mu=
st be understood. The immigrants came and stayed because they got jobs her=
e. They got jobs because many economic sectors could not recruit enough wo=
rkers among U.S. residents. These were not minor industries. As Trump has=
 shown=2C the migrants were filling essential jobs in agriculture and at h=
otels. People do not surge into countries where they cannot earn a living.=
 They came because there were jobs=2C the menial jobs that citizens on the=
 whole avoided. And with their expulsion=2C those industries and many othe=
rs are facing deep crises. I don=E2=80=99t know where the farm labor will=
 come from=2C and that is a serious problem.

The problem was how it was organized in the first place. As in prior influ=
xes of migrants=2C the necessity of the labor was evident=2C and the proce=
ss was to attract and=2C above all=2C legalize and integrate the migrants=
 and their children. That process was in place and could have been expande=
d=2C if needed=2C identifying and expelling criminals speedily and retaini=
ng the rest. The failure to do that by the prior administration =E2=80=93=
 abandoning processes for immigration that were in place and working for m=
any decades =E2=80=93 was the first mistake. Trump=E2=80=99s error was in=
 not realizing the extent to which critical industries depended on these m=
igrants.

<strong>Response: </strong>Wars end either in the total destruction of the =
enemy=E2=80=99s army and occupation of its country, or in negotiations. Isr=
ael may be able to deeply damage Iran=E2=80=99s military but not render it =
unable to resist to some degree. Israel cannot invade and occupy Iran, give=
n the distance between them and Iran=E2=80=99s massive size. So the war wil=
l end in negotiations. For there to be negotiations, there has to be someon=
e to negotiate with. Hence, keeping Khamenei alive makes him the negotiator=
 =E2=80=93 and a weak one. Khamenei has lost many of his subordinates and h=
is Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is deeply diminished, while the large =
conventional army, hostile to the IRGC, remains intact.<br>
<br>
At the moment, he is the only leader who can legitimately negotiate on Tehr=
an=E2=80=99s behalf, and he is weak and vulnerable. So keeping him alive ma=
y not necessarily help Israel, but it doesn=E2=80=99t hurt. Better a weaken=
ed negotiator than his successor. So I would guess.</p>

                            <strong>Comment: </strong><em>Russia is in a co=
nundrum, as they know the U.S. is actively supporting the Ukrainians. Howev=
er, they can=E2=80=99t strike the U.S. or another NATO country without NATO=
 then demonstrating what F-16s can do to their military dumps and drone cen=
ters, really embarrassing Russia. Declining powers are dangerous and perhap=
s there will be a resolution where Russia is given Crimea. The huge problem=
 is that by doing so, we anger Romania and others because of nautical issue=
s in the Black Sea involving any settlement that Russia will read very libe=
rally.</em><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Crimea is now, in reality, Russian. Unless someo=
ne is able and willing to invade Crimea and take it from Russia, this is a =
reality countries like Romania must live with. The U.S. is not about to inv=
ade Crimea, nor is Romania. So withholding recognition of this is political=
ly satisfying to some, but does not change the reality. The question of con=
trol of the Black Sea or air lanes does not have to be conceded, and in a w=
orld of drones, if Russia tries to exert control over them it can be resist=
ed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As for weakened countries being dangerous, I find them much less dangerous =
than powerful countries. True, a weakened country can undertake reckless ac=
tion, but the likelihood of it succeeding is far more limited than a though=
tful action from a powerful nation. The Russian seizure of Crimea could hav=
e been resisted by countries in the region but, being weaker, they were pru=
dent and did not resist. They would like the occupation reversed, but it wo=
uld take forces from throughout Europe and the United States to conduct amp=
hibious warfare. That is not going to happen because the price even from a =
weakened Russia could be significant. So I do not see weakened countries as=
 more dangerous than powerful ones. On the other hand, I don=E2=80=99t thin=
k that even powerful nations wish to pay the cost of trying to drive Russia=
 out.

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>It =
seems the Russians are hitting back by trying to take more ground. They hav=
e, but it is a small amount. Perhaps they are testing the European response=
. While </em><em>not anticipating that Russia will invade any NATO country,=
 they have issues to the south and want to expand elsewhere. It is confusin=
g not only to us but in Russia. Can you explain Russia=E2=80=99s behavior?<=
/em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The reason for Russia acting aggressively is not=
 to test Europe, but to reverse the reality that Russia lost the war by not=
 being able to defeat Ukraine in short order. To have spent more than three=
 years taking only a fraction of Ukraine represents a failure of an assumed=
 great power. From this flows the idea that Russia has ceased to be a great=
 power, or that Putin managed the war badly. Conceding either point would b=
e extremely painful for Russia=E2=80=99s self-image and Putin=E2=80=99s cre=
dibility. So they continue to fight the war in the hope that the fortunes m=
ight shift either because Ukraine reached its limits or Ukraine=E2=80=99s a=
llies failed to support it. They misread Trump=E2=80=99s gestures of accomm=
odation for an opening. Trump cannot afford to allow Russia to exploit his =
openness to a settlement by humiliating him. And the Europeans cannot affor=
d to admit their own inability to help Ukraine.<br>
<br>
So the Russians took Trump as indifferent to Ukraine, and therefore indiffe=
rent to Putin=E2=80=99s own reputation, and mistook European division for a=
n inability to act. Therefore, Putin chose to extend the war in the hopes o=
f reversing the perception of Russia and himself. But I believe he simply a=
mplified his initial error of overestimating Russian power, and underestima=
ting the resistance to his actions. The alternative is accepting that Russi=
a failed to defeat Ukraine and that Putin miscalculated.

<strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>You mention in your re=
port from Serbia that you continue to believe the intervention in Serbia wa=
s &quot;insane.&quot; I distinctly remember you, at the time, questioning t=
he pretext for invasion, in particular the situation in Kosovo. Can you exp=
and on these observations and the striking analytical outcome for people wh=
o haven't been listening to you for 26 years?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>The insanity was in the manner in which the=
 United States responded to Serbia=E2=80=99s (or Yugoslavia=E2=80=99s) trea=
tment of Kosovars. Their choice of action was not to send sufficient troops=
 into Kosovo to defeat the forces that were oppressing the Kosovars, but in=
stead to wage an extended bombing campaign on Belgrade, a city crowded with=
 civilians. It was assumed that the bombing of a large, crowded city would =
force Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of Yugoslavia, to capitulate and halt =
his actions in Kosovo. When Milosevic was not moved by the bombing, they co=
ntinued, rather than act in the area where they claimed the atrocities were=
 happening.<br>
<br>
That was the insanity I was referring to: bombing an urban area filled with=
 powerless civilians for more than two months, inflicting terror and death =
on a city, without solving the problem they were concerned with. That in th=
e end it worked did not justify its cost. I am far from a pacificist, and I=
 accept that war is part of the human condition, but continuing a bombing c=
ampaign against civilians when it was clear that Milosevic was indifferent =
to its effects struck me as madness and needlessly cruel.</p>

<strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;You=E2=80=99re absolutely corre=
ct that immigration to America should have always continued to follow a quo=
ta system. And the problem we=E2=80=99re in now has very few good answers b=
ecause the inflow of illegals was ultimately done on a drip by drip basis, =
and people are now proposing on the far right that we try to mass deport 10=
+ million people, which would sink the country. </em><br>
<br>
<em>The only thing that sounds viable is that everyone be given some sort o=
f amnesty for registering. If they=E2=80=99re found to be criminals, either=
 in their home country or here, they will be deported. Most people should b=
e told we=E2=80=99re not going to kick you out, you have to fully register,=
 and you=E2=80=99re gonna have a 10-year path to citizenship =E2=80=93 and =
by the way, you must learn English, which should=E2=80=99ve been done from =
the beginning, huge mistake=E2=80=A6. then we know things will work out. Bu=
t as you probably also know, we=E2=80=99re being led primarily by a kakisto=
cracy of very corrupt people.&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>That is one way to do it, but first the fun=
damental reality must be understood. The immigrants came and stayed because=
 they got jobs here. They got jobs because many economic sectors could not =
recruit enough workers among U.S. residents. These were not minor industrie=
s. As Trump has shown, the migrants were filling essential jobs in agricult=
ure and at hotels. People do not surge into countries where they cannot ear=
n a living. They came because there were jobs, the menial jobs that citizen=
s on the whole avoided. And with their expulsion, those industries and many=
 others are facing deep crises. I don=E2=80=99t know where the farm labor w=
ill come from, and that is a serious problem.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The problem was how it was organized in the first place. As in prior influx=
es of migrants, the necessity of the labor was evident, and the process was=
 to attract and, above all, legalize and integrate the migrants and their c=
hildren. That process was in place and could have been expanded, if needed,=
 identifying and expelling criminals speedily and retaining the rest. The f=
ailure to do that by the prior administration =E2=80=93 abandoning processe=
s for immigration that were in place and working for many decades =E2=80=93=
 was the first mistake. Trump=E2=80=99s error was in not realizing the exte=
nt to which critical industries depended on these migrants.</p>
