DAILY MEMO: RUSSIAN DEPARTURES [3]
RURAL RUSSIA IS SHRINKING, AND MOSCOW MAY LEAVE THE INF TREATY IN ALL BUT NAME.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
RUSSIA UNBOUND. On Aug. 4, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow no longer considers itself bound to the self-imposed restrictions [4] regarding the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The
statement is a response to what Russia sees as provocation from the United States and its allies. It alleges the U.S. has set a precedent for transferring land-based systems to European NATO
countries, for delivering Typhon medium-range missile systems to the Philippines, and testing and training launches of the PrSM missile. Combined with Western statements about ensuring the long-term
presence of such systems in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, Moscow says, this creates a direct threat to Russian national security [5].
GERMAN DECLINE. A recent survey by German broadcaster RND [6] showed that 59 percent of Germans would “probably not” or “definitely not” defend their country militarily if it were attacked.
Only 16 percent said they would “definitely” take up arms, with an additional 22 percent indicating they “probably” would, leaving just 38 percent potentially willing to fight. These findings
potentially challenge Germany’s plans to expand its military, including its ambitions to recruit 40,000 new troops annually and grow active forces to 260,000 by 2035.
DAS VEDANYA. Nearly 130 small towns in Russia, where some 3.4 million people live, are disappearing. Over the past decade, the number of residents in small towns has decreased by 314,000, thanks
largely to job losses. Unsurprisingly, the greatest exoduses are in northern towns that support coal, metallurgical and timber industries. In response, Moscow has allocated 4 billion rubles ($50
million) for the implementation of investment projects [7] focused on infrastructure development for more than 100 such towns, and it has established new standards to determine which of Russia’s 170
state-run companies [8] will be relocated from Moscow to peripheral regions.
INDIA BRISTLES. Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval arrived in Moscow for a high-level visit [9] aimed at enhancing defense and energy cooperation amid escalating tensions with the U.S. Though
the trip had already been scheduled, it took on added significance after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on India over its continued purchase of Russian oil. India’s Ministry of
External Affairs [10] criticized the move, noting that New Delhi bought Russian oil with Washington’s approval to help stabilize global markets. It also drew attention to the scale of economic ties
among India, the U.S., the EU and Russia. The external affairs minister will travel to Russia later this month ahead of an annual India-Russia summit.
SOLIDIFYING PEACE. Thai and Cambodian officials are holding talks in Kuala Lumpur [11] this week following deadly border clashes between the two countries late last month. The meetings will cover six
pivotal issues, including the ceasefire agreement reached last week, the withdrawal of troops, safe zones, and setting up local coordination channels. They will also hold ministerial-level talks Aug.
7.
TARGETING BEIJING. The EU plans to impose sanctions against China over its support for Russia in the war with Ukraine, according to a Politico report [12]. The news comes following a Reuters report
that Beijing has supplied Moscow with drone engines labeled as “industrial refrigeration units.” Some 15 EU countries have contacted China inquiring about these supplies, but Beijing has so far
either denied its involvement or refused to respond.
ISRAELI MEDIATION. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly been working in recent weeks to reduce tensions [13] between the United States and Russia over several matters. Netanyahu
spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin twice in the past week – on July 28 and Aug. 4 – about the progress of his efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly also aware of
Netanyahu’s mediation attempts.
BUDDING PARTNERSHIP. Japan will be a key partner in Australia's program to build a new fleet of general-purpose frigates, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said [14]. He added that Australia
has selected the Mogami-class frigate designed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the “preferred platform” for its 10 billion Australian dollar ($6.5 billion) project.
NEW INITIATIVE. The U.S. and NATO announced the launch of a new initiative to support Ukraine [15]. The Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List will enable alliance members and partners to finance the
supply of U.S.-made weapons and military equipment for Kyiv. Denmark, Norway and Sweden have so far pledged 500 million euros ($578 million) for the fund.
