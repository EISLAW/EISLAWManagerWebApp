AI consulting is exploding, projected to hit a staggering $630 billion by 2=
028. But beneath the hype lies a troubling reality: many so-called AI consu=
ltants are merely repackaging generic advice under the banner of AI, diluti=
ng trust and damaging credibility across the industry. If you're engaging w=

The $630 Billion AI Consulting Gold Rush Is Creating an Army of Frauds
How to build a legitimate AI consulting practice that delivers real value=
=E2=80=94and avoid the AI-washing trap that's poisoning the entire ecosyste=
m
Executive Summary
The numbers are staggering. AI consulting revenues are projected to hit $63=
0 billion by 2028. Over 50% of large enterprises are already using AI consu=
lting services. Every consulting firm=E2=80=94not just AI specialists=E2=80=
=94is reporting surging demand for AI expertise.
Here's the problem: Most of these consultants are frauds.
I don't mean intentional scammers. I mean well-meaning business consultants=
 who've slapped "AI-powered" onto their existing services without understan=
ding what RAG is, when to deploy AI agents, or how to actually implement an=
ything beyond ChatGPT integrations.
This AI-washing epidemic isn't just bad business=E2=80=94it's poisoning the=
 entire ecosystem. Bad implementations are teaching enterprises that AI is =
overhyped snake oil. I personally know consultants making six figures just =
cleaning up other consultants' messes.
But there's a different path. Six principles separate legitimate AI consult=
ants from the hucksters flooding the market. Master these, and you'll build=
 sustainable client relationships while the AI-washers burn bridges.
The stakes couldn't be higher. Get this right, and you'll ride the biggest =
consulting wave in decades. Get it wrong, and you'll kill trust in AI for e=
veryone.
The Uncomfortable Truth About Today's AI Consulting Market
Winners keep winning. That's the first uncomfortable truth about the AI con=
sulting boom.
The consultants making real money aren't AI natives who've spent years mast=
ering transformers and vector databases. They're existing consultancies wit=
h established client relationships who've added "AI" to their service menu.=
 Marketing agencies. Process improvement firms. Development shops. Anyone w=
ith distribution channels and existing books of business.
Why? Because distribution is still king, even in the AI era.
But here's where it gets ugly. Most of these established consultancies are =
just AI-washing their existing offerings. They paint the big "AI" sign on t=
heir proposals, jack up their rates, and hope nobody asks hard questions.
I've seen this firsthand. A business consultant sits across from a client w=
ho asks a perfectly reasonable question: "When should we use RAG versus fin=
e-tuning?" You can watch the consultant's face go blank. They mumble someth=
ing about "talking to a technical person about that."
That's not a super technical question. Any business consultant selling AI s=
ervices should have a high-level opinion on retrieval-augmented generation.=
 It's like a marketing consultant not knowing when to use email versus soci=
al media.
The temptation is obvious. AI is a general-purpose technology that can theo=
retically improve everything these consultants already do. Marketing automa=
tion becomes "AI-powered marketing." Process improvement becomes "intellige=
nt automation." Team formation becomes "AI-driven organizational design."
Slap some ChatGPT integrations on top, maybe throw in a dashboard with "pre=
dictive analytics," and you've got yourself an AI consultancy. Right?
Wrong. Dead wrong.
This approach is burning bridges faster than consultants can build them. I =
know multiple consultants whose entire practice consists of cleaning up aft=
er other consultants' botched AI implementations. One told me he's booked s=
olid through 2026 just fixing what others broke.
The damage goes beyond individual client relationships. Every failed AI pro=
ject teaches an enterprise that AI is overhyped nonsense. Every consultant =
who promises "AI transformation" and delivers a glorified Excel macro makes=
 the next legitimate AI consultant's job harder.
We're seeing this trust erosion in real-time. Remember Amazon's "AI-powered=
" walk-out grocery stores? Turns out it was never really AI=E2=80=94just pe=
ople in India watching video feeds. That's the kind of revelation that make=
s CFOs skeptical of any proposal with "AI" in the title.
The cruel irony? There's never been a better time to start a legitimate AI =
consulting practice. The demand is real. The technology actually works. But=
 you can't fake your way through it anymore.
The market is about to separate the authentic practitioners from the AI-was=
hers. If you=E2=80=99re interested in consulting at all, the question is: w=
hich side will you be on?
The Six Pillars of Legitimate AI Consulting
1. Get Brutally Specific (Stop the Buzzword Nonsense)
"We'll implement an agentic mesh to create AI-powered synergies across your=
 digital transformation."
If you just threw up in your mouth a little, good. That's what legitimate A=
I sounds like to clients who've been burned by consultant-speak.
The antidote to AI-washing is brutal specificity. Instead of "AI-powered ma=
rketing," talk about "using Claude to rewrite your email sequences based on=
 customer response patterns." Instead of "intelligent automation," say "we'=
ll build a system that automatically categorizes support tickets and routes=
 urgent issues to your senior team."
Specificity does two things buzzwords can't: it demonstrates actual experti=
se, and it helps clients visualize real outcomes.
But here's the deeper principle: you can't be specific about AI without bei=
ng specific about something else first. AI is a general-purpose technology=
=E2=80=94like electricity or software=E2=80=94that enhances other capabilit=
ies. You need those other capabilities to exist first.
Think of it as the strangler fig principle. Strangler figs grow around exis=
ting trees, eventually transforming or replacing them entirely. But they ca=
n't grow without that original tree structure. Your AI expertise needs to g=
row around your existing domain knowledge.
Cursor nailed this approach. Development environments were a boring, commod=
itized business for decades. Then Cursor wrapped AI around the core IDE exp=
erience so elegantly that developers couldn't imagine coding without it. Th=
ey didn't become "AI consultants"=E2=80=94they became the definitive AI-ena=
bled development platform.
That's your playbook. Own the boring business first. Then make it extraordi=
nary with AI.
2. Own Your Domain Before You Touch AI
You cannot be a "general AI consultant." It's not a real job.
I see this mistake constantly. Smart people with solid AI technical knowled=
ge try to position themselves as experts on "AI strategy" or "AI transforma=
tion" broadly. They fail because clients can't distinguish them from the th=
ousands of other generalists flooding the market.
Instead, pick a domain you already understand deeply. Maybe it's SEO and yo=
u've been watching Google's algorithm changes for a decade. Maybe it's clin=
ical operations and you've managed hospital workflows. Maybe it's supply ch=
ain logistics, financial planning, or restaurant management.
Whatever it is, own it completely. Then layer AI expertise on top.
I can speak authoritatively about product management and AI because I did p=
roduct management for years before AI became mainstream. When I explain how=
 AI agents should be deployed in product development workflows, people beli=
eve me=E2=80=94not because of my AI knowledge alone, but because of my prod=
uct credibility.
This domain-first approach also gives you pricing power. Three specific AI =
offerings beat one general one every time. "AI for emergency medicine," "AI=
 for franchise operations," and "AI for B2B sales teams" are all sellable s=
ervices. "AI consulting" is not.
The beauty of specificity is that it enables adjacent expansion. Master AI =
for SEO, and you can credibly extend to AI for paid marketing, then social =
marketing, then eventually become an AI-enabled marketing consultancy. But =
that progression only works if you start with deep domain expertise in one =
vertical.
Don't be afraid of that background. Embrace it. That's not the thing you're=
 pivoting away from=E2=80=94that's your competitive moat.
3. Build Your Distribution Network (Not Just Your LinkedIn)
Distribution trumps everything else in consulting. The best AI consultant w=
ithout clients is unemployed. The mediocre consultant with strong relations=
hips stays busy.
But AI consulting makes distribution both easier and harder. Easier because=
 AI touches everything, so your network can expand in multiple directions. =
Harder because clients are skeptical of AI expertise claims.
The solution: become known for specific, valuable AI insights within your d=
omain. Put your real work out there=E2=80=94within NDA constraints=E2=80=94=
in ways that help other consultants remember you.
You want to be "that person" other consultants think of for referrals. When=
 a marketing consultant lands a client who needs AI-powered email personali=
zation, you want them to think, "I need to call James." When a process cons=
ultant encounters a workflow automation challenge, you want to be their fir=
st call.
How do you become that person? Content that demonstrates specific expertise=
=2E Not thought leadership fluff about=20=
"the future of AI." Tactical breakdown=
s of how you've implemented specific solutions. Case studies that show meas=
urable results. Technical explanations that prove you actually understand t=
he technology.
This is especially critical now because the AI consulting space is flooded =
with fraudsters. Clients and other consultants need to separate real expert=
ise from marketing hype. Clear, specific content does that filtering work.
Build partnerships deliberately. Find specialists whose capabilities comple=
ment yours. If you're the AI-for-logistics person, you need friends who han=
dle AI for finance, AI for customer service, and AI for operations. Large e=
nterprises want comprehensive AI strategies, not point solutions.
Your network becomes your competitive advantage. When clients expand their =
AI initiatives=E2=80=94and they will=E2=80=94you want to be positioned to g=
row with them.
4. Templatize Smartly in the Age of AI
Every consultant learns about templates eventually. They're how you scale k=
nowledge, reduce delivery time, and create predictable outcomes. But AI cha=
nges the template game entirely.
Old-school consulting templates were static frameworks you'd customize manu=
ally for each client. Think McKinsey's classic slide decks or Deloitte's as=
sessment matrices. Useful, but labor-intensive to adapt.
AI enables living templates. Prompts that extend automatically based on cli=
ent context. Frameworks that customize themselves using data the client pro=
vides. Assessment tools that adapt their recommendations in real-time.
I've seen consultants build intake forms that feed directly into AI systems=
 that generate preliminary strategic recommendations. The consultant review=
s and refines the output, but the heavy lifting of customization happens au=
tomatically. The client gets something that feels bespoke, the consultant s=
aves 80% of the prep time.
This isn't about replacing human expertise=E2=80=94it's about augmenting it=
=2E The consultant still needs to under=
stand what good strategy looks like, h=
ow to facilitate difficult conversations, and when the AI's recommendations=
 miss the mark. But templates can handle much more of the routine analytica=
l work.
The key is starting with solid consulting fundamentals. Your templates need=
 to capture real frameworks that actually work. AI can make them more dynam=
ic and responsive, but it can't fix fundamentally broken methodologies.
Packaging still matters enormously. Clients struggling with AI need clarity=
 about what you're offering and where your engagement boundaries are. Templ=
ates help you communicate scope and deliverables in ways clients can unders=
tand and budget for.
The difference is that your templates can now be far more sophisticated and=
 client-specific than ever before.
5. Position Yourself in the Value Chain
AI implementations require multiple specialties working together. You can't=
 be great at everything, and you shouldn't try.
Instead, get very clear about which part of the AI value chain you own, and=
 build relationships with specialists who cover the other parts. Maybe you'=
re excellent at AI strategy but partner with specialists for technical impl=
ementation. Maybe you handle data preparation and model training but work w=
ith others for change management and user adoption.
This matters more in AI consulting than traditional consulting because AI p=
rojects tend to be more technically complex and organizationally disruptive=
=2E A typical enterprise AI initiative=20=
might require strategy consulting, tec=
hnical architecture, data engineering, model development, integration work,=
 training, and change management.
No consultant does all of that well. The ones who try usually deliver medio=
cre results across the board.
Define your lane clearly. "I help retail companies identify high-impact AI =
use cases and build business cases for executive approval. When it's time f=
or technical implementation, I bring in my partners who specialize in that =
phase."
This positioning does three things: it makes you better at what you do focu=
s on, it gives you more opportunities through partnerships, and it provides=
 natural expansion paths as clients' needs evolve.
The partnership approach also helps with credibility. When other consultant=
s are willing to stake their reputations on working with you, it signals au=
thenticity in a way no marketing copy can match.
6. Put Your Work Out There (Within NDA Limits)
Content creation isn't optional for AI consultants anymore. The market is t=
oo noisy and too full of fraudsters. You need to prove you know what you're=
 talking about.
But this isn't about thought leadership or personal branding. It's about de=
monstrating competence in ways that help potential clients and partners eva=
luate your capabilities.
Share tactical insights from your work. Explain specific AI implementation =
challenges and how you solved them. Break down technical concepts in ways t=
hat business stakeholders can understand. Show your thinking process, not j=
ust your conclusions.
Yes, NDAs constrain what you can share. But you can usually discuss methodo=
logies, frameworks, and lessons learned without revealing client-specific d=
etails. You can write about "a healthcare system" instead of naming the spe=
cific hospital. You can explain your approach to "a logistics optimization =
project" without disclosing proprietary data.
The goal is helping people map your expertise. When someone has a specific =
AI challenge, you want them to remember that article where you explained ex=
actly that problem and how to solve it.
This content serves multiple audiences simultaneously. Potential clients se=
e your expertise and approach. Other consultants understand your capabiliti=
es for potential partnerships. Talented practitioners evaluate whether they=
 want to work with you.
The quality bar is high because the stakes are high. Publish something that=
 demonstrates shallow thinking, and you'll be grouped with the AI-washers. =
Publish something that shows deep insight, and you'll stand out from the cr=
owd.
Be generous with your knowledge. The consultants building lasting practices=
 share what they know, connect people with opportunities, and contribute to=
 raising the overall quality of AI implementations.
The ecosystem needs more authentic practitioners and fewer charlatans. Your=
 content can help tip that balance.
The Stakes: Why This Matters for Everyone
The AI consulting failure stories are already piling up, and they're poison=
ing the well for everyone.
Amazon's "Just Walk Out" grocery stores were supposed to showcase the futur=
e of AI-powered retail. Customers would grab items and leave, with AI autom=
atically detecting and charging for purchases. Except it wasn't AI doing th=
e work=E2=80=94it was hundreds of people in India watching video feeds and =
manually updating shopping carts. When the truth came out, it didn't just e=
mbarrass Amazon. It made every retail executive more skeptical of AI vendor=
 promises.
That's the pattern repeating across industries. A consulting firm promises =
"AI-powered predictive analytics" and delivers basic Excel forecasting with=
 a fancy dashboard. A "machine learning optimization platform" turns out to=
 be hard-coded business rules. An "intelligent automation system" requires =
constant manual intervention to function.
Each failure teaches decision-makers that AI is overhyped nonsense sold by =
slick consultants. Those lessons stick. I've sat in meetings where executiv=
es immediately dismissed legitimate AI proposals because they'd been burned=
 by previous consultants who overpromised and underdelivered.
The damage compounds because AI adoption requires organizational buy-in. Un=
like simple software purchases, AI implementations often require process ch=
anges, new workflows, and cultural shifts. When those initiatives fail due =
to consultant incompetence, companies don't just lose money=E2=80=94they lo=
se momentum. Teams become resistant to future AI projects. Budgets get slas=
hed. Innovation stalls.
Meanwhile, legitimate AI practitioners watch their market get poisoned by a=
mateurs. Sales cycles lengthen as prospects demand extensive proof-of-conce=
pts. Pricing pressure increases as clients assume all AI consultants are ba=
sically the same. Trust becomes harder to build and easier to lose.
The consulting-to-consultant cleanup economy is already booming. I know pra=
ctitioners billing $400+ per hour just to fix what other consultants broke.=
 One specialist told me 70% of his engagements in 2025 start with "We tried=
 AI before and it didn't work." 70%! His first month is always spent rebuil=
ding trust and realistic expectations.
This isn't sustainable. Every botched implementation makes the next consult=
ant's job harder. Every AI-washed proposal that fails to deliver makes ente=
rprises more skeptical of the technology itself.
The irony is brutal: we're in the middle of the most significant productivi=
ty revolution since the internet, but bad consulting is convincing decision=
-makers that it's all hype.
The consultants who get this right will build decade-long client relationsh=
ips as AI transforms entire industries. The ones who don't will burn out th=
eir credibility within 18 months.
Which future are you building toward?
Your Next Move
If you=E2=80=99re involved in consulting at all, stop reading and start aud=
iting. Right now, before you write another proposal or take another client =
call.
The AI-Washing Reality Check:
Ask yourself these brutal questions:
Can you explain when to use RAG versus fine-tuning in plain English?
Do you have specific opinions about embedding models and vector databases?
Could you walk a client through the actual implementation steps for your pr=
oposed AI solution?
Can you estimate realistic timelines for AI model training and deployment?
If you're hedging on any of these, you're not ready to sell AI consulting s=
ervices. Full stop.
The 30-Day Legitimate AI Consultant Action Plan:
Week 1: Domain Definition
List every area where you have genuine expertise (not surface knowledge)
Pick the one domain where you have 5+ years of real experience
Research how AI is currently being applied in that specific vertical
Identify three specific AI use cases where you could add immediate value
Week 2: Technical Foundation Building
Take a hands-on course in your chosen AI application area
Build a small proof-of-concept project you can demonstrate
Join relevant technical communities and start asking questions
Document your learning process=E2=80=94this becomes content later
Week 3: Network Mapping
List every consultant you know who complements your capabilities
Identify specialists in adjacent areas you'll need for larger engagements
Reach out to five potential partners with specific collaboration proposals
Join industry groups where your target clients congregate
Week 4: Content and Templates
Write one detailed case study about your proof-of-concept project
Create a simple assessment framework clients can use to evaluate AI readine=
ss
Develop templates for three specific service offerings
Publish your first piece of AI-specific content
The Partnership Playbook:
You need these relationships before you need them:
Technical Implementation Partner: Someone who can build what you design
Data Engineering Specialist: For clients with messy data infrastructure
Change Management Expert: For organizations resistant to AI adoption
Industry Specialist: Someone with deeper domain knowledge in adjacent verti=
cals
Reach out now with specific value propositions. "I focus on AI strategy for=
 healthcare operations. I'm looking for a technical partner who can handle =
implementation when my clients are ready to build. Here's a client scenario=
 where I'd want to bring you in..."
The Credibility Signal Checklist:
Your content should demonstrate:
Specific technical knowledge about AI tools and techniques
Deep understanding of your chosen domain's unique challenges
Real experience implementing AI solutions (even small ones)
Honest assessment of what works and what doesn't
Clear frameworks others can apply to their situations
The Red Line Test:
Before you take any AI consulting engagement, ask: "If this project fails, =
will it be because the client wasn't ready, or because I promised something=
 I can't deliver?"
If the answer is the latter, don't take the engagement. The short-term reve=
nue isn't worth the long-term reputation damage.
Start building legitimacy today. The AI gold rush won't last forever, but t=
he consultants who establish authentic expertise now will ride the wave for=
 the next decade.
The fraudsters will flame out within 18 months. The professionals will buil=
d generational practices.
Which camp are you joining?
Bottom Line
Get specific, get real, or get out. Yes, I=E2=80=99m being that blunt! I th=
ink hucksters are at risk of poisoning the AI consultant space with fake ex=
pertise.
Longterm, the $630 billion AI consulting market will reward authenticity an=
d punish fraud=E2=80=94but only if we collectively raise the bar. Every AI-=
washed proposal that fails makes the next legitimate consultant's job harde=
r. Every consultant who promises transformation and delivers Excel macros t=
eaches enterprises that AI is snake oil.
You have a choice. You can join the army of fraudsters slapping "AI-powered=
" on existing services and hope nobody asks hard questions. You'll make mon=
ey for 12-18 months before your reputation craters.
Or you can do the work. Pick your domain. Build real expertise. Create genu=
ine partnerships. Develop frameworks that actually work. Put your knowledge=
 out there for scrutiny.
The easy path leads to burnout. The hard path builds decade-long client rel=
ationships.
The AI revolution is real. The technology works. The demand is massive. But=
 the window for establishing legitimate expertise is closing fast.
Choose wisely. The entire ecosystem is watching.

anything beyond ChatGPT integrations.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=

out the AI consulting boom.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The consultants making real mon=
ey aren't AI natives who've spent years mastering transformers and vector d=
atabases. They're existing consultancies with established client relationsh=
ips who've added &quot;AI&quot; to their service menu. Marketing agencies. =
Process improvement firms. Development shops. Anyone with distribution chan=
nels and existing books of business.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Why? Because distribut=
ion is still king, even in the AI era.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's where it =
gets ugly. Most of these established consultancies are just AI-washing thei=
r existing offerings. They paint the big &quot;AI&quot; sign on their propo=
sals, jack up their rates, and hope nobody asks hard questions.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">I've seen this firsthand. A business consultant sits across from a cli=
ent who asks a perfectly reasonable question: &quot;When should we use RAG =
versus fine-tuning?&quot; You can watch the consultant's face go blank. The=
y mumble something about &quot;talking to a technical person about that.&qu=
ot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">That's not a super technical question. Any business con=
sultant selling AI services should have a high-level opinion on retrieval-a=
ugmented generation. It's like a marketing consultant not knowing when to u=
se email versus social media.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The temptation is obvious. AI=
 is a general-purpose technology that can theoretically improve everything =
these consultants already do. Marketing automation becomes &quot;AI-powered=
 marketing.&quot; Process improvement becomes &quot;intelligent automation.=
&quot; Team formation becomes &quot;AI-driven organizational design.&quot;<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">Slap some ChatGPT integrations on top, maybe throw in a das=
hboard with &quot;predictive analytics,&quot; and you've got yourself an AI=
 consultancy. Right?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=

in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Thi=
s approach is burning bridges faster than consultants can build them. I kno=
w multiple consultants whose entire practice consists of cleaning up after =
other consultants' botched AI implementations. One told me he's booked soli=
d through 2026 just fixing what others broke.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The damage go=
es beyond individual client relationships. Every failed AI project teaches =
an enterprise that AI is overhyped nonsense. Every consultant who promises =
&quot;AI transformation&quot; and delivers a glorified Excel macro makes th=
e next legitimate AI consultant's job harder.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We're seeing =
this trust erosion in real-time. Remember Amazon's &quot;AI-powered&quot; w=
alk-out grocery stores? Turns out it was never really AI=E2=80=94just peopl=
e in India watching video feeds. That's the kind of revelation that makes C=
FOs skeptical of any proposal with &quot;AI&quot; in the title.</p><p style=

eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If you just threw up in your mouth a little, =
good. That's what legitimate AI sounds like to clients who've been burned b=
y consultant-speak.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The antidote to AI-washing is brutal sp=
ecificity. Instead of &quot;AI-powered marketing,&quot; talk about &quot;us=
ing Claude to rewrite your email sequences based on customer response patte=
rns.&quot; Instead of &quot;intelligent automation,&quot; say &quot;we'll b=
uild a system that automatically categorizes support tickets and routes urg=
ent issues to your senior team.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Specificity does two =
things buzzwords can't: it demonstrates actual expertise, and it helps clie=
nts visualize real outcomes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's the deeper principl=
e: you can't be specific about AI without being specific about something el=
se first. AI is a general-purpose technology=E2=80=94like electricity or so=
ftware=E2=80=94that enhances other capabilities. You need those other capab=
ilities to exist first.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think of it as the strangler fig pr=
inciple. Strangler figs grow around existing trees, eventually transforming=
 or replacing them entirely. But they can't grow without that original tree=
 structure. Your AI expertise needs to grow around your existing domain kno=
wledge.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">Cursor nailed this approach. Development environmen=
ts were a boring, commoditized business for decades. Then Cursor wrapped AI=
 around the core IDE experience so elegantly that developers couldn't imagi=
ne coding without it. They didn't become &quot;AI consultants&quot;=E2=80=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I see this mistake constant=
ly. Smart people with solid AI technical knowledge try to position themselv=

 of other generalists flooding the market.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =

ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Every consultant learns about templates eventua=
lly. They're how you scale knowledge, reduce delivery time, and create pred=
ictable outcomes. But AI changes the template game entirely.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">Old-school consulting templates were static frameworks you'd customize ma=
nually for each client. Think McKinsey's classic slide decks or Deloitte's =
assessment matrices. Useful, but labor-intensive to adapt.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
AI enables living templates. Prompts that extend automatically based on cli=

vides. Assessment tools that adapt their recommendations in real-time.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">I've seen consultants build intake forms that feed directly int=
o AI systems that generate preliminary strategic recommendations. The consu=
ltant reviews and refines the output, but the heavy lifting of customizatio=
n happens automatically. The client gets something that feels bespoke, the =
consultant saves 80% of the prep time.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn't about rep=
lacing human expertise=E2=80=94it's about augmenting it. The consultant sti=
ll needs to understand what good strategy looks like, how to facilitate dif=
ficult conversations, and when the AI's recommendations miss the mark. But =
templates can handle much more of the routine analytical work.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

 need to capture real frameworks that actually work. AI can make them more =
dynamic and responsive, but it can't fix fundamentally broken methodologies=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=

clients can understand and budget for.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=

try.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">Instead, get very clear about which part of the AI val=
ue chain you own, and build relationships with specialists who cover the ot=
her parts. Maybe you're excellent at AI strategy but partner with specialis=
ts for technical implementation. Maybe you handle data preparation and mode=
l training but work with others for change management and user adoption.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">This matters more in AI consulting than traditional consultin=
g because AI projects tend to be more technically complex and organizationa=
lly disruptive. A typical enterprise AI initiative might require strategy c=
onsulting, technical architecture, data engineering, model development, int=
egration work, training, and change management.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
