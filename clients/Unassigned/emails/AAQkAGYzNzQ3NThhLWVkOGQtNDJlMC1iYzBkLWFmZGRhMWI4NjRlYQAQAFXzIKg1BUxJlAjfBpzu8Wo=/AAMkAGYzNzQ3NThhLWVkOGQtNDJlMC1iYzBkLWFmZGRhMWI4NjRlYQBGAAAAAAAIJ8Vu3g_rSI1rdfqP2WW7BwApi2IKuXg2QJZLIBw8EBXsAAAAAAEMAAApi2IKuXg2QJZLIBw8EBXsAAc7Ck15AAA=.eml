I think this is a debate our children will ultimately have to conclude (hen=
ce my illustration here), but we are the ones who have to start the convers=
ation.
What does our world look like in a future with work? Let=E2=80=99s set asid=
e all the grindset advice for a minute. Let=E2=80=99s set aside the =E2=80=
=9Cjust ship something to github=E2=80=9D advice, which is a variant of tur=
tles-all-the-way-down [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7858ac6-a07a-4b03-86=

jMRMPOw0 ] thinking. Because you see if everyone ships to github with their=
 vibe-coded app, we=E2=80=99re in the same pickle we=E2=80=99re currently i=
n with resumes=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99re drowning in a sea of perfect AI resume=
s and nobody can find signal.
I want to get past that part of the conversation and have a more interestin=
g discussion around how AI is shaping jobs, frankly acknowledge some widely=
 circulated claims [ https://substack.com/redirect/d018524a-4946-4e64-9b22-=
c5875f2daf33?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMR=
MPOw0 ] about the future of the job market this week, and get to something =
actionable and useful for actual careers in the here and now, in 2025. This=
 is what we owe future generations: the start of an answer on AI.
Right now, most advice on jobs today is answering =E2=80=9Cwhat does it tak=
e to show you do work,=E2=80=9D not =E2=80=9Cwhat are the actual job skills=
 changing that matter for us in 2025, and how can we map that back against =
what the smartest minds in tech are thinking about AI? How can we develop a=
 more comprehensive take on jobs in 2025?=E2=80=9D
I think the latter question is much more useful.
This post does that. I first get into the context=E2=80=94the debate betwee=
n Dario [ https://substack.com/redirect/d92eadff-065c-480b-852e-615ce37a3d4=
2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and=
 Gergely [ https://substack.com/redirect/de38958e-83fd-4948-8a0b-0ced771416=
7f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] ov=
er jobs and the future of jobs in the age of AI (they=E2=80=99re not debati=
ng directly but they are absolutely using social media to make very differe=
nt cases aimed at each other). You might call Dario the pessimist and Gerge=
ly the optimist here, but it=E2=80=99s more nuanced than that.
After laying out the debate, I get into why this matters: how we make sense=
 of conflicting visions of the future profoundly affects our ability to pro=
actively prepare for jobs. What are the skills that matter, why? I dive int=
o both technical skills, and how jobs are changing, and also take a little =
detour into emotional skill territory (which I think is severely under-disc=
ussed in tech). Last but not least, I focus the camera and we talk a bit ab=
out how this is all crystallizing in current hiring practices in mid-2025.
I hope you enjoy this one! It=E2=80=99s a complex piece and quite lengthy, =
but it=E2=80=99s tightly organized and absolutely worth a Saturday read. En=
joy!

The Fundamental Schism: Two Incompatible Theories of Work
Yes, there are links for everything referenced here at the bottom of this p=
ost. Over 50 of them. I decided not to hyperlink throughout to keep the flo=
w going.
The Surface Debate
At first glance, this looks like a simple disagreement about AI capabilitie=
s. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, sees a world where "we're 3 to 6 months =
from a world where AI is writing 90% of the code" and "'Virtual collaborato=
rs' will handle 90% of tasks in fields like coding, design, and analytics".
Gergely Orosz, the pragmatic engineer who's worked at Uber, Microsoft, and =
Skype, pushes back hard. His Twitter response (May 28, 2025) to Peter Yang =
sharing Dario's quote was visceral: "Remind me who will deal with keeping t=
ech debt at bay; nonfunctional requirements (like the app performant, laten=
cy low), rationalising resource usage (to not go bankrupt with cloud bills)=
, keeping on top of security and I can go on and on. Today, 'AI' cannot do =
either of these."
But this isn't really about whether AI can write code. It's about something=
 much deeper.
Dario's World: The Computational Theory of Everything
To understand Dario's position, you need to understand his intellectual fra=
mework. In his 14,000-word essay "Machines of Loving Grace," he lays out a =
breathtaking vision where "In terms of pure intelligence, it is smarter tha=
n a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields =E2=80=93 biology, progr=
amming, math, engineering, writing, etc."
This isn't hyperbole from a startup founder trying to raise money. This is =
a carefully reasoned position from someone who:
Was VP of Research at OpenAI during GPT-2 and GPT-3
Has a PhD in computational neuroscience
Is building the models he's talking about
His core belief: Intelligence is substrate-independent and fundamentally co=
mputational. If neurons can do it, transformers can do it - it's just a mat=
ter of scale and training.
From this worldview, the progression is inevitable:
Entry-level work has the lowest complexity threshold =E2=86=92 automated fi=
rst
Mid-level work is mostly pattern matching =E2=86=92 automated next
Senior work is complex but still information processing =E2=86=92 eventuall=
y automated
The timeline isn't a guess - it's a calculation based on scaling laws. When=
 he says "AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs =E2=
=80=94 and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years", he'=
s not fear-mongering. He's extrapolating from capability curves he sees in =
his own models.
The deeper implication: In Dario's world, trying to "stay ahead" of AI is l=
ike trying to outrun a car on foot. The race is already over; we just haven=
't reached the finish line yet.
Gergely's World: The Iceberg Theory of Systems
Gergely isn't just skeptical - he's pattern-matching against decades of exp=
erience with complex systems. I=E2=80=99m naming his insight the "Complexit=
y Gear Ratio"=E2=80=94but the idea is all Gergely. He reveals why he thinks=
 Dario is fundamentally wrong:
Individual/Startup: AI provides near-linear productivity gains
Enterprise: AI gains disappear into organizational friction
Why? Because complexity scales non-linearly in large organizations (it=E2=
=80=99s a function of graph theory if you=E2=80=99re curious about the math=
), and that dramatically reduces the efficiency of applied AI. It does not =
eliminate it! It=E2=80=99s still worth it for big companies to go after AI,=
 but (unless they are very very good at scoping AI problem shapes) they are=
 chasing 10% gains where startups are seeing 100% gains. Of course 10% at b=
illions scale can still be worth it, and that explains why the Fortune 500 =
is still going after AI hard.
TLDR; big orgs have an iceberg problem, where 90% of the complexity of the =
org is hard to address with AI.
Going deeper on big orgs and AI is a future post. Let=E2=80=99s get back to=
 jobs and AI here: Debates over productivity metrics aside, Gergely's real =
insight is about the nature of knowledge itself. From his writing on tech d=
ebt:
"Tech debt is something you want to have for early-stage projects: for thro=
waway prototypes, for MVPs, and when validating the business model of a sta=
rtup."
This isn't about bad code. It's about the fact that software systems encode=
 decisions that nobody remembers making. Every production system is an arch=
aeological site of compromises, workarounds, and undocumented assumptions.
His example from Twitter's crisis: "I talked with a software engineer who w=
as assigned to be oncall for systems they did not know about. When they tri=
ed to get more information, they found the team which built the service had=
 been let go"
The deeper implication: Knowledge in real systems isn't stored in code or d=
ocumentation. It's stored in the heads of people who've been debugging at 3=
am. It emerges from the interaction between human judgment and system behav=
ior over time.
This is Polanyi's Paradox in action: "We know more than we can tell." And i=
f we can't tell it, we can't encode it for an AI to learn.
The Evidence: Follow the Money, Not the Mouth
Here's where it gets interesting. If we ignore what people say and watch wh=
at they do, a pattern emerges:
Anthropic's Actions:
Still hiring senior engineers at top-of-market rates
Testing showed their model was capable of "extreme blackmail behavior" - th=
ey need humans to figure out why
Building AI safety teams (if AI could ensure AI safety, why hire humans?)
GitHub's Strategy: Thomas's reply: =E2=80=9Cthose companies [cutting junior=
s] have it backwards. If you're not hiring young people who are open-minded=
 about new ideas (including GenAI) then you risk getting stuck where you ar=
e."
Thomas Dohmke isn't running a charity. GitHub sees something others miss: A=
I-native juniors are transformation agents. They don't just use AI - they r=
eshape how organizations think about problems.
Shopify's Bet: Farhan Thawar: "We're hiring 1k engineering interns in 2025.=
=2E. if you are an AI centaur (LLM +=20=
human) =E2=80=94 this is made for you."
A thousand interns. Not AI subscriptions. Not more GPUs. Human beings who c=
an think with AI.
The Pascal's Wager of Tech Careers
Your insight about this being like Pascal's Wager is profound. Let's think =
through the payoff matrix:
If you prepare for Gergely's world (complexity, systems thinking, human jud=
gment):
Gergely's right =E2=86=92 You're essential
Dario's right =E2=86=92 You still developed problem-solving skills that tra=
nsfer to any future
If you prepare for Dario's world (wait for AI to handle everything):
Dario's right =E2=86=92 You... hope for UBI?
Gergely's right =E2=86=92 You're unemployable
But there's a deeper asymmetry here. Even in Dario's own vision, we need hu=
mans who can:
Decide what problems are worth solving
Handle the "extreme blackmail behavior" edge cases
Make value judgments about trade-offs
Deal with the mess during the transition
The revealing quote comes from Dario himself at Davos: "You'll just check i=
n occasionally, like a CEO overseeing a team"
But here's the thing about CEOs - they're paid for judgment, not execution.=
 They're paid to know when the metrics are lying, when to break the rules, =
when to trust their gut over the data. These are exactly the skills Gergely=
 says matter. (It=E2=80=99s also worth noting that this CEO notion is antit=
hetical to how startup CEO=E2=80=99s actually run their businesses=E2=80=94=
I don=E2=80=99t know even one who =E2=80=9Cchecks in occasionally=E2=80=9D =
lol.)
The Agency Principle: What "Ship Code" Really Means
The common advice to "build in public" or "ship side projects" completely m=
isses the point. It's not bad=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve seen it work=E2=80=94but=
 it=E2=80=99s not about code. It's about demonstrating what I'll call the A=
gency Stack:
Problem Recognition: You see issues others ignore
Solution Design: You can imagine better states
Resource Marshaling: You can gather what you need (tools, knowledge, people=
)
Execution: You can navigate from current state to better state
Learning Integration: You update your models based on what worked/failed
This is what employers are actually testing for, whether they realize it or=
 not. When Shopify asks for "AI centaurs," they're not looking for prompt e=
ngineering skills. They're looking for people who can:
See a broken process
Imagine how AI could help
Build a solution using whatever tools work
Deploy it in the real world
Handle what breaks
Teach others the pattern
This is why Gergely's world is actionable and Dario's isn't. You can't prep=
are for a post-human-work future. But you can develop agency, judgment, and=
 systems thinking right now.
The Complexity Moat: Why Enterprise Experience Matters
Gergely's observation about the gear ratio between AI intelligence and ente=
rprise productivity isn't a temporary friction - it's a fundamental propert=
y of complex systems.
Consider what happens in a real enterprise:
The Code: 10 million lines across 50 languages
The Politics: 7 teams need to approve any change
The History: That weird function exists because of a lawsuit in 2019
The Dependencies: Touching this breaks something in another continent
The Undocumented: The actual business logic lives in Excel sheets
An AI that's 10x smarter than o3 still can't:
Know why the CEO's nephew's feature request got prioritized
Understand that the "technical debt" in the payment system is actually a re=
gulatory requirement
Navigate the unwritten rule that you never deploy on the third Thursday (th=
at's when Finance runs their reports)
This isn't a bug - it's the nature of human organizations. And it's why "LL=
Ms are clearly changing software engineering hiring" but in the opposite di=
rection than Dario predicts. Companies need MORE humans who understand both=
 AI capabilities AND organizational realities.
The Skill That Transcends the Debate
Whether Dario or Gergely is right, one meta-skill remains valuable: Complex=
 Problem Solving at Scale with High Agency.
This means:
Complex: Multi-stakeholder, multi-system, multi-order effects
At Scale: Solutions that work for 10 users and 10 million
High Agency: You don't wait for permission or perfect information
In Dario's world, this person directs AI armies. In Gergely's world, this p=
erson builds systems AI can't understand. In reality, this person thrives r=
egardless.
The Ultimate Test: The Anthropic Paradox
Here's the delicious irony that reveals everything: Anthropic, while buildi=
ng the AI that will supposedly replace programmers, is desperately hiring..=
=2E programmers. Senior ones. Expensive=
 ones. Ones who can debug why their AI=
 model developed "extreme blackmail behavior."
If Dario was willing to bet big money on his own timeline, Anthropic would =
be:
Freezing hiring
Building with current team until AI can take over
Preparing for the post-programmer world
Instead, the risk of overshoot is clearly so great that Dario is willing to=
 engage in a talent war with every other AI company, paying massive premium=
s for human judgment. And if Dario can=E2=80=99t be sure he doesn=E2=80=99t=
 need human judgement and needs to keep hiring, how can anyone else not tak=
e the same bet?
You can look at the notorious pace of VC funding for seed companies and see=
 the same pattern: these investments are VC=E2=80=99s speaking with money s=
aying (as a group) that they believe there will still be a market to buy th=
ese company=E2=80=99s AI services. Implicitly, that is a bullish bet on the=
 US economy in 7-10 years (the normal exit horizon for a seed stage company=
). Which is right in the middle of Dario=E2=80=99s pessimistic timeline.
This is the market speaking. And it's saying: Whatever the future holds, th=
e transition will be messy, complex, and require massive amounts of human j=
udgment to navigate.
The Actionable Insight
You need to know the terms of the debate, but the debate itself doesn't mat=
ter. What matters is becoming someone who can:
See systems, not just code
Solve problems, not just implement solutions
Learn continuously, not just acquire skills
Build judgment, not just knowledge
Whether AI writes 90% of code or 9%, these capabilities remain valuable. Wh=
ether juniors disappear or transform, these skills compound.
The real bet isn't on Dario or Gergely being right. It's on complexity cont=
inuing to exist, problems continuing to emerge, and judgment continuing to =
matter.
And every company's hiring pattern - including Anthropic's - suggests that'=
s the safest bet you can make.
The Third Dimension: What AGI Builders Are Quietly Developing
While the Dario-Gergely debate rages on about computational power versus sy=
stem complexity, there's a parallel conversation happening inside the compa=
nies building AGI. Joe Hudson coaches many of these leaders=E2=80=94includi=
ng OpenAI's Sam Altman and key figures at DeepMind and Anthropic=E2=80=94an=
d he's noticed something striking.
They're not abandoning technical excellence or systems thinking. But they'r=
e also investing heavily in three capacities we rarely discuss in tech:
The Three Skills No One Talks About
1. Emotional Clarity "We don't make logical decisions. We make emotional on=
es," Hudson observes. Neuroscience backs this up=E2=80=94damage the emotion=
al center of the brain and even simple decisions become impossible. The AGI=
 builders get this. They're learning to recognize and metabolize emotions r=
ather than bypass them, because they've seen brilliant strategies fail when=
 fear or ego hijacked the execution.
2. Discernment In a world drowning in data and options, knowing what to ign=
ore becomes crucial. Hudson cites the "jam study"=E2=80=94shoppers bought 1=
0x more jam when offered 6 options instead of 24. The builders are developi=
ng the capacity to see through noise, to sense what matters when AI can gen=
erate infinite possibilities.
3. Connection "People don't want you to be perfect. They want to be connect=
ed to you." This isn't about being likeable=E2=80=94it's about creating gen=
uine human presence. Google's research found psychological safety was the #=
1 predictor of team performance. As AI handles more execution, the ability =
to create this safety becomes differentiating.
Why This Matters
These aren't alternatives to technical skills or systems thinking. The peop=
le developing these capacities are simultaneously pushing the boundaries of=
 AI capabilities and navigating massive technical complexity. They're doing=
 both/and, not either/or.
What's telling is that companies seeing the biggest returns=E2=80=94Microso=
ft's 10x valuation increase under Nadella's empathy-focused leadership, Goo=
gle's "Search Inside Yourself" program=E2=80=94are investing in these human=
 capacities alongside their technical bets.
The Quiet Differentiator
Whether Dario's right about AI writing all code or Gergely's right about ir=
reducible complexity, these three capacities remain valuable. They're not o=
ften discussed in tech hiring or career advice, but the people closest to A=
GI are prioritizing them.
Not because they're giving up on technical excellence. But because they rec=
ognize that in a world of increasing automation and complexity, these deepl=
y human skills become differentiating in ways we're only beginning to under=
stand.
Hudson puts it simply: "No matter how intelligent AI becomes, it can't live=
 your life for you." The builders get this. That's why they're developing w=
isdom alongside their transformers. And it=E2=80=99s not just a skillset th=
at=E2=80=99s useful if you=E2=80=99re a billionaire.=20
From Wisdom to Verification: The Interview Revolution
Joe Hudson's clients at OpenAI are developing emotional clarity, discernmen=
t, and connection=E2=80=94deeply human capacities that can't be automated. =
But there's a practical problem: How do you test for these qualities when c=
andidates can have ChatGPT whispering perfect answers in their ear?
The answer emerging across tech is both ironic and inevitable: companies ar=
e dragging interviews back to the physical world.
The Great Return to Conference Rooms
Google just announced they're moving more interviews onsite after catching =
candidates using AI during remote sessions. The tell was almost poetic=E2=
=80=94candidates would suddenly speak in complete paragraphs of flawless te=
chnical explanation, their cadence shifting from human hesitation to ChatGP=
T's confident prose.
As one engineer on Reddit observed: "We spent a decade moving everything re=
mote for efficiency. Now we're hauling everyone back to whiteboards because=
 we literally can't tell if we're interviewing a human or a prompt engineer=
 with a good setup."
This isn't paranoia. It's companies discovering that testing for Hudson's "=
wisdom work" requires something AI can't fake: embodied human presence.
What In-Person Actually Tests
The shift back to conference rooms isn't really about preventing cheating. =
It's about observing the very capacities Hudson identifies:
Emotional Clarity in Real Time
How do you handle the stress of thinking at a whiteboard?
Can you acknowledge confusion without panicking?
Do you get defensive when challenged, or curious?
Discernment Under Pressure
Faced with a complex problem, do you dive into details or step back to ques=
tion the premise?
Can you identify what matters without a search engine?
Do you know when to stop optimizing?
Connection Without a Script
Can you build on someone else's idea immediately?
Do you think out loud in a way that invites collaboration?
Can you disagree without triggering defensiveness?
The New Interview Friction
Companies are adding what seems like inefficiency but is actually a humanit=
y filter:
Phone screens via actual phone: No screen for ChatGPT, just your voice and =
your thoughts
Paper coding exercises: Can't copy-paste from Copilot when you're writing w=
ith a pen
Interruption tests: Humans can pivot mid-sentence; AIs need to regenerate
Latency checks: That 3-second delay while you read ChatGPT's response is be=
coming a disqualifier
One hiring manager described it bluntly: "I don't care if you can solve the=
 problem. I care if YOU can solve the problem."
The Deeper Irony
We're using analog methods to hire for digital roles. We're making the proc=
ess less efficient to find people who can navigate infinite efficiency. We'=
re testing for humans by removing the very tools that were supposed to augm=
ent humanity.
This connects back to Hudson's observation: "No matter how intelligent AI b=
ecomes, it can't live your life for you." Companies are realizing they need=
 to hire people who can live through the interview=E2=80=94literally, physi=
cally, without augmentation.
What This Means for Job Seekers
The premium isn't on perfection anymore. It's on being visibly, undeniably =
human:
Thinking out loud with false starts and corrections
Drawing messy diagrams that capture the essence
Admitting what you don't know with confidence
Building genuine rapport in the moment
The very inefficiencies of human thinking=E2=80=94the pauses, the "umms," t=
he gestural reasoning=E2=80=94have become assets. Not because they signal i=
ncompetence, but because they signal presence.
The Ultimate Test
Perhaps the most telling sign of this shift: companies are increasingly end=
ing interviews with variations of "How do we know this was really you?"
Not accusatory, but curious. Because in a world where AI can simulate exper=
tise, the ability to prove your humanity=E2=80=94through emotional clarity,=
 discernment, and genuine connection=E2=80=94becomes the most important ski=
ll you can demonstrate.
Hudson teaches his clients to develop these capacities for navigating AGI. =
Turns out, you need them just to get hired in the first place.
The Bottom Line
The Dario-Gergely debate reveals a crucial tension: will AI automate everyt=
hing or will complexity save us? But watching what companies actually do=E2=
=80=94not what thought leaders say=E2=80=94reveals the real story. Anthropi=
c pays top dollar for engineers who can debug "extreme blackmail behavior" =
in their models. GitHub and Shopify are betting on AI-native juniors as tra=
nsformation agents. Google's dragging interviews back to whiteboards becaus=
e they can't tell if they're talking to a human or ChatGPT. The market has =
already decided: high-agency problem-solving matters more than either compu=
tational theory or complexity theology.
Meanwhile, the people building AGI are quietly investing in ancient human c=
apacities. Joe Hudson coaches OpenAI's leadership not on transformer archit=
ectures but on emotional clarity, discernment, and connection. Satya Nadell=
a's empathy focus drove Microsoft's 10x valuation increase. Google teaches =
engineers meditation. This isn't retreating from technology=E2=80=94it's re=
cognizing that as AI handles more execution, wisdom becomes the differentia=
tor. The builders understand something both debaters miss: in a world where=
 machines can do everything, being human isn't a limitation. It's the point=
=2E
For job seekers, the path forward is surprisingly clear. Stop trying to com=
pete with AI or hide in complexity. Develop the meta-skill that transcends =
both: the ability to navigate uncertainty with judgment, connect with human=
s authentically, and solve problems that matter at scale. Whether that mean=
s shipping code that demonstrates taste, building systems that prevent prob=
lems, or simply showing up to an interview as an actual human who can think=
 at a whiteboard=E2=80=94the premium is on capabilities that resist automat=
ion not through complexity but through humanity.
The future belongs neither to those who believe AI will do everything nor t=
o those who insist it can't. It belongs to those who can work alongside AI =
while remaining irreducibly human=E2=80=94messy, uncertain, connected, and =
wise. That's not just career advice. That's preparation for the only future=
 that's actually arriving.

ut AI capabilities. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, sees a world where &quo=
t;we're 3 to 6 months from a world where AI is writing 90% of the code&quot=

 Bottom Line</strong></h1><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The Dario-Gergely debate reveals a c=
rucial tension: will AI automate everything or will complexity save us? But=
 watching what companies actually do=E2=80=94not what thought leaders say=
=E2=80=94reveals the real story. Anthropic pays top dollar for engineers wh=
o can debug &quot;extreme blackmail behavior&quot; in their models. GitHub =
and Shopify are betting on AI-native juniors as transformation agents. Goog=
le's dragging interviews back to whiteboards because they can't tell if the=
y're talking to a human or ChatGPT. The market has already decided: high-ag=
ency problem-solving matters more than either computational theory or compl=
exity theology.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Meanwhile, the people building AGI are quie=
tly investing in ancient human capacities. Joe Hudson coaches OpenAI's lead=
ership not on transformer architectures but on emotional clarity, discernme=
nt, and connection. Satya Nadella's empathy focus drove Microsoft's 10x val=
uation increase. Google teaches engineers meditation. This isn't retreating=
 from technology=E2=80=94it's recognizing that as AI handles more execution=
, wisdom becomes the differentiator. The builders understand something both=
 debaters miss: in a world where machines can do everything, being human is=
n't a limitation. It's the point.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For job seekers, the path=
 forward is surprisingly clear. Stop trying to compete with AI or hide in c=
omplexity. Develop the meta-skill that transcends both: the ability to navi=
gate uncertainty with judgment, connect with humans authentically, and solv=
e problems that matter at scale. Whether that means shipping code that demo=
nstrates taste, building systems that prevent problems, or simply showing u=
p to an interview as an actual human who can think at a whiteboard=E2=80=94=
the premium is on capabilities that resist automation not through complexit=
y but through humanity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The future belongs neither to those=
 who believe AI will do everything nor to those who insist it can't. It bel=
ongs to those who can work alongside AI while remaining irreducibly human=
=E2=80=94messy, uncertain, connected, and wise. That's not just career advi=
ce. That's preparation for the only future that's actually arriving.</p><di=
