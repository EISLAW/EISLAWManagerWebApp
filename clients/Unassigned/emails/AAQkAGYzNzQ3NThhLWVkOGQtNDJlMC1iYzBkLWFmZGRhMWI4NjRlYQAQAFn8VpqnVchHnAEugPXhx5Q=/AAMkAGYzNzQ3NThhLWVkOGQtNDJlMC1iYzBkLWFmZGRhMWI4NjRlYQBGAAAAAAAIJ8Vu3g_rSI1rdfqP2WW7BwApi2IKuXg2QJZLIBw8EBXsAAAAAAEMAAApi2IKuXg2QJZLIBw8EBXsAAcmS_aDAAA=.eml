HOW THE MIDDLE EAST UNDERMINES US GLOBAL STRATEGY [3]
WASHINGTON IS STILL SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COUNTERING REGIONAL THREATS.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
The United States is in the process of a historic shift in its geostrategy [4] meant to reduce its exposure to global conflicts. The Middle East, however, seems to be an exception; U.S. military
forces continue to engage in combat and, if anything, have beefed up their deployment. The Middle East is much more fragile than other theaters, so Washington will need to work much harder to succeed
in relying on regional stakeholders to take the lead on security issues.
On April 28, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet was lost overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman while operating in the Red Sea. Though the incident itself was human error, it happened only because the
carrier was making a sharp turn to evade incoming missile and drone attacks being launched by Houthi forces. This is the second aircraft of its kind to be lost in the area over the past four months
– the first one was mistakenly shot down by the USS Gettysburg, a guided-missile cruiser, last December.
The incident this month comes as the U.S. military operational tempo has greatly increased in the region. Over the past six weeks alone, Washington has conducted over 800 airstrikes in Yemen. For the
U.S., this spike is necessary given that the Houthis have disrupted commercial traffic through the Red Sea [5] and targeted U.S. naval vessels since late 2023. The problem, however, is that the U.S.
has spent as much as a billion dollars over the past three weeks to degrade the Houthis, who can threaten freedom of navigation by spending only tens of thousands of dollars. This is clearly an
unsustainable imbalance of expenditures.
Strategically, there is a much bigger issue: The U.S. is trying to pull back from being the guarantor of global security – which it can’t exactly do if it is spending so much money on naval
operations in Yemen. The concurrent deployment of two carrier strike groups – the USS Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea – and the stationing of six B-2 strategic
bombers on Diego Garcia [6] further underscores this inconsistency with the overall strategy.
In Europe, the U.S. is not having so much trouble. It continues to pressure Europe to take the reins of its own defense against Russia, which could end up occupying as much as 20 percent of Ukraine
for the foreseeable future. And in the Western Pacific, Washington has encouraged its allies to increase their share of responsibility in the efforts to counter China. Even so, there is a difference
in Washington’s attitude toward security in Eurasia and its approach to the high seas.
As a continental power indigenous to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the U.S. has an interest in sustaining its global maritime dominance. After all, the only threat to the U.S. homeland comes from
these waterways. This is the rationale behind the Trump administration’s efforts to seek control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. (In the case of Greenland, there is the added dimension of
changing climatic conditions that could turn Arctic tundra into a maritime extension of both oceans.)
Ensuring that hostile actors are not able to meaningfully operate in these waters, especially given Chinese moves to operate in this space [7], is thus a U.S. imperative. Notably, the Indian Ocean
basin [8] is not quite as concerning to the Pentagon. Wedged between Africa, Asia and Australia, the Indian Ocean is a more or less contained maritime space that requires fewer of Washington’s
resources.
[The Middle East & Indian Ocean] [9]
_(click to enlarge) [10]_
As extensions of the Indian Ocean, the Arabian and Red seas are important avenues for global trade, which is why the United States currently dedicates so many resources to the Houthi threat. The U.S.
does not maintain a fleet dedicated to the Indian Ocean. The closest one is the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, which is responsible for the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and a limited area in the
northwestern Indian Ocean. The next closest is the 7th Fleet, which, located in Japan, is the largest in the world, with an expansive area of responsibility stretching from the international date line
to the India-Pakistan border, and from the Kuril Islands to Antarctica.
If the U.S. delegates security in the Indian Ocean, it must rely on regional stakeholders. But in truth, none have the capability. India could someday [11], but as the latest conflict with Pakistan
[12] and the ongoing standoff with China [13] show, New Delhi will struggle to project power in the Indian Ocean basin, much less the waters around the Arabian Peninsula, for the foreseeable future.
In the Middle East, there is no comparable actor. Turkey will remain bogged down in Syria [14] for the foreseeable future and so is not in a position to project influence that far south in the region.
Israel can conduct long-distance airstrikes in Yemen [15], but that’s not the same as providing regional security. Saudi Arabia could not defeat the Houthis [16] despite a six-year military
intervention in Yemen and was forced to cede the strategic port of Hodeida to the group in 2021. (This was a key factor in the Houthis’ ability to disrupt shipping through the Red Sea two years
later.) And Iran is responsible for the very maritime threat the Houthis pose.
Even if some of these states had the intent and the capability to take the lead in regional security, their conflicting imperatives prevent them from doing so [17]. There are separate deals in the
making [18] among the region’s four players, which could help the Trump administration reduce its military footprint. Still, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will be able to extricate itself from the
region. What this means is that the Middle East will continue to be a drag on U.S. efforts to focus on the Chinese challenge.

 engage in combat and, if anything, have beefed up their deployment. The Mi=

 to work much harder to succeed in relying on regional stakeholders to take=
 the lead on security issues.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On April 28, a U.S=
. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet was lost overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman=
 while operating in the Red Sea. Though the incident itself was human error=
, it happened only because the carrier was making a sharp turn to evade inc=
oming missile and drone attacks being launched by Houthi forces. This is th=
e second aircraft of its kind to be lost in the area over the past four mon=
ths =E2=80=93 the first one was mistakenly shot down by the USS Gettysburg,=
 a guided-missile cruiser, last December.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The incident this =
month comes as the U.S. military operational tempo has greatly increased in=
 the region. Over the past six weeks alone, Washington has conducted over 8=
00 airstrikes in Yemen. For the U.S., this spike is necessary given that <a=

al traffic through the Red Sea</a> and targeted U.S. naval vessels since la=
te 2023. The problem, however, is that the U.S. has spent as much as a bill=
ion dollars over the past three weeks to degrade the Houthis, who can threa=
ten freedom of navigation by spending only tens of thousands of dollars. Th=
is is clearly an unsustainable imbalance of expenditures.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Strategically, the=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Europe, the U.S=

e reins of its own defense against Russia, which could end up occupying as =
much as 20 percent of Ukraine for the foreseeable future. And in the Wester=
n Pacific, Washington has encouraged its allies to increase their share of =
responsibility in the efforts to counter China. Even so, there is a differe=

roach to the high seas.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As a continental p=
ower indigenous to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the U.S. has an interes=

d the Trump administration=E2=80=99s efforts to seek control of the Panama =
