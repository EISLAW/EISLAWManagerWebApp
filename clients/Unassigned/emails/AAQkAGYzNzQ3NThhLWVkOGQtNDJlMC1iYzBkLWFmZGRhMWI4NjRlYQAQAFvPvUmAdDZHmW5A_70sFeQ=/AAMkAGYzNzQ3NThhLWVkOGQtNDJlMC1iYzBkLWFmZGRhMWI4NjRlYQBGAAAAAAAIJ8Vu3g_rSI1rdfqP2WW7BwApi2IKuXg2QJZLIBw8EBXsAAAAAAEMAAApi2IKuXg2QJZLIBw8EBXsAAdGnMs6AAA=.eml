0-year-wait-is-over-writing

Let me set the table here with a few facts. I promise you this all connects=
 in so stay with me.
Claude burns ~15x more tokens in an multi-agent configuration than it does =
in chat.
This is because Claude is doing multiple language manipulation tasks at onc=
e.
Writing is ~5200 years old, and it hasn=E2=80=99t changed much in that time=
=2E
Mechanical code is 220 years old, and serious code is much younger (~70 yea=
rs).
Coding has evolved more since 1960 than writing has evolved since 3200 BC.
Coding has evolved more because coding is compute congruent!
It was built for computers, it evolved with them.
So it=E2=80=99s not surprising that how we code exploded as compute explode=
d=E2=80=94something like 200x multiple on deployment speed at scale now vs.=
 a few decades ago.
Writing did none of these things. Writing was just bolted on to computers.
Heck, it even looks like paper on a screen.
That=E2=80=99s because writing is 8-16x more complex than code.
Computers lacked the compute to process language correctly for decades.
So we haven=E2=80=99t even had the option to get this right until =E2=80=A6=
 about now.
And now it=E2=80=99s all about to change. This article slash podcast is pac=
ked. It includes: reflections about where writing is going, my personal wor=
kflow on writing, why I=E2=80=99m not just using ChatGPT, why I=E2=80=99m p=
aying for Claude, a third tool I=E2=80=99m using too=E2=80=94my current sta=
ck is 4 models deep actually=E2=80=94plus a brief manifesto on where writin=
g is going, and a framework to think beyond the model about writing so we g=
et less stressed about particular model choices! There=E2=80=99s a ton here=
 so I hope you enjoy.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
First, a brief reflection on code and language=E2=80=94a short manifesto
Think about this, and if it doesn=E2=80=99t make sense read the article and=
 then come back:
Text is more complex than code
Code was a simplified language suitable to machine convos
Therefore code was the first of the languages to get technical leverage
By technical leverage I mean CICD devops, staging and prod=E2=80=94all the =
things we associate with modern dev pipelines
These have 200x=E2=80=99d deployment speeds and scales
They=E2=80=99ve enabled large scale language architecture (we call that cod=
e bases)
Now we have machines that understand and speak natural language
Technical leverage is extending for the first time to the act of natural la=
nguage composition
The learnings from half century of dev pipeline maturity can be used to inf=
er the future arc of doc creation process
Because doc creation is so central to knowledge work this becomes predictiv=
e of the direction of work itself
Specifically we are currently at the primitive write programs and hope they=
 run stage=E2=80=94we write a prompt and hope it works
While we have enterprises with more sophisticated document flows these exis=
t by definition in narrow complexity scopes (one type etc)
The strength of language is complexity and the ability to handle wide seman=
tic meaning and wide complexity to communicate meaning
We have no tooling for this
And tooling that relies on the old parchment method of composition is incor=
rect
The blank sheet is not the point because it presume the value is brain to c=
anvas
With technical leverage the value is brain to impact =E2=80=94 we can creat=
e multip-ly at once =E2=80=94 we can refine through extensive doc pipelines
This will take tools (the cursor for writing etc)
But it can start with using models correctly
Models at the front line today either optimize for conceptual intelligence =
or for longterm agentic execution
o3 for conceptual intelligence, Sonnet and Opus for agentic execution, Perp=
lexity also
Think about it: agentic architecture shapes doc pipeline positioning
o3 for dev environment and opus / sonnet / perplexity downstream
These are crude primitives
We will evolve them
But they point the way toward a technically leveraged semantic future
Second, my personal model stack for writing
I use o3 or o3 Pro (depending on complexity) for drafting. I think of this =
as the dev stage and I like a conceptual thinker. I love how o3 gets into t=
he problem space quickly and thinks logically to open things up. o3 Pro see=
ms similar in early testing, but on a much larger scale.
Then my instinct is to move to Opus 4. Why? Because I=E2=80=99m looking for=
 congruence. Think of this as pull request stuff. I=E2=80=99m checking for =
holes in thinking. I=E2=80=99m trying to get some multi-agent research done=
 to explore the space. I=E2=80=99m using those extra 15x tokens for multi-a=
gent work to my advantage there.
Ok, first stop at Perplexity in Pro Research mode. Time to start thinking a=
bout fact checking. I find over multiple iterations that with correct promp=
ting I=E2=80=99m getting well over 90% accuracy with Opus 4, but of course =
that=E2=80=99s not acceptable. The bar is perfect. I think of this as testi=
ng.
Next over to the staging environment, Sonnet 4. Time to start wrestling wit=
h voice and polish and structure. I burn probably 3-4x more tokens here tha=
n I do with Opus, because I get obsessive about the angle. I=E2=80=99m ofte=
n pulling in my own voice directly to start getting what I want here.=20
Ok, now we have to do final testing! Back to Perplexity for another round o=
f testing before =E2=80=9Cdeployment.=E2=80=9D=20
And none of this excuses any gap in the final result. Is it me? Does it fee=
l like me? Is it true and correct as best I can tell? These are the questio=
ns that keep me up at night. And look it=E2=80=99s not about Substack actua=
lly.=20
People obsess sometimes over whether I have some secret sauce for this arti=
cle pace. This isn=E2=80=99t it=E2=80=94can=E2=80=99t be=E2=80=94all these =
models are a few weeks old and I=E2=80=99ve been on this pace much longer.
It=E2=80=99s NOT the models or whatever. It=E2=80=99s the curiosity that fu=
els the fire. I find the curiosity pace is 100x more leverage and power to =
sustain daily posts than any particular technical stack. That=E2=80=99s wha=
t actually sustains me. Persistent obsessive curiosity. I look at the model=
 stack above as more or less the right things in the right spots for a lot =
of knowledge work, unless you get very numbers heavy and then I=E2=80=99d p=
robably move o3 further down the pipeline, and check it with Opus 4.
Hope this recipe helps!
Third, a left brain report on writing technologies
The Coming Revolution in Natural Language: How Writing Will Follow Code's 5=
0-Year Journey
Something profound is happening at the intersection of human language and a=
rtificial intelligence. As I've researched this phenomenon, I've become con=
vinced we're witnessing the early stages of a transformation that will resh=
ape how humans compose text as fundamentally as version control and DevOps =
revolutionized programming.
The thesis is both simple and radical: natural language composition is abou=
t to undergo the same technical evolution that programming experienced over=
 the past 50 years. But unlike code, which was designed for machines, natur=
al language carries the full weight of human complexity=E2=80=94making this=
 transformation both more challenging and more consequential.
From punch cards to continuous deployment
To understand where writing is headed, we need to understand where code has=
 been. The transformation is staggering: in the 1960s, programmers literall=
y wrote code on punch cards and hoped it would run when fed into a mainfram=
e. Today, Amazon deploys code every 11.7 seconds. That's not a typo=E2=80=
=94engineers push changes to production thousands of times daily with minim=
al human intervention.
The numbers tell a remarkable story. According to Google's DevOps Research =
and Assessment team, elite-performing organizations now deploy code 208 tim=
es more frequently than low performers, with 106 times faster lead times fr=
om commit to deploy. Where a deployment once took months and carried existe=
ntial risk, it now happens in under an hour with a 5% failure rate.
This didn't happen overnight. The journey required fundamental innovations:=
 version control systems (Git in 2005), continuous integration (conceptuali=
zed in 1991, practical by 2001), automated testing frameworks, and containe=
rization. Each innovation built on the last, creating an ecosystem where co=
de became living, collaborative, and self-documenting.
The complexity paradox
Here's where the story gets interesting. Programming languages were deliber=
ately designed as simplified communication protocols=E2=80=94context-free g=
rammars that trade expressiveness for computational tractability. They occu=
py a lower rung on the Chomsky hierarchy than natural languages, which requ=
ire context-sensitive or mildly context-sensitive grammars for adequate des=
cription.
Natural language is orders of magnitude more complex. Where programming lan=
guages have deterministic parsing and unambiguous syntax, natural language =
thrives on ambiguity, context, and pragmatic inference. A single sentence l=
ike "The horse raced past the barn fell" can send our brains into recursive=
 loops trying to parse its garden-path structure. Programming languages can=
't express metaphor, irony, or the infinite creative potential of human lan=
guage.
Yet this complexity is precisely why the transformation will be so powerful=
=2E When we finally build infrastructur=
e for the full expressiveness of human=
 language, we won't just improve efficiency=E2=80=94we'll unlock new forms =
of collaborative intelligence.
The transformer moment
The watershed came on June 12, 2017, when Google researchers published "Att=
ention Is All You Need." The transformer architecture didn't just improve n=
atural language processing; it made it parallelizable and scalable in ways =
that suddenly made machine understanding of human language practical.
The progression since has been breathtaking. GPT-3 in 2020 demonstrated eme=
rgent abilities at 175 billion parameters. By 2023, models began exceeding =
human performance on standardized tests. Gemini Ultra became the first mode=
l to surpass human experts on the MMLU benchmark at 90%. We've gone from st=
atistical models with ~247 perplexity to systems achieving less than 10 per=
plexity on complex language tasks.
But here's the crucial insight: we've only just reached the starting line. =
Machines can now understand natural language well enough to participate in =
its manipulation and transformation. This is equivalent to computers in the=
 1970s becoming fast enough to compile code efficiently=E2=80=94a prerequis=
ite for everything that followed.
The hidden crisis of knowledge work
While Silicon Valley celebrates AI breakthroughs, enterprises face a stark =
reality: knowledge workers spend 20-35% of their time on document-related a=
ctivities rather than actual knowledge creation. McKinsey's research shows =
workers dedicate one full day per week just searching for and gathering inf=
ormation. Fortune 500 companies lose an estimated $12 billion annually to d=
ocument inefficiency.
The statistics are sobering. Only 3% of knowledge workers are satisfied wit=
h their company's document handling. 83% would rather recreate a document t=
han search for it. Nearly half have discovered they were working on the wro=
ng version of a document. We've digitized paper but haven't fundamentally r=
eimagined how documents work.
This inefficiency exists because we lack infrastructure for natural languag=
e that parallels what we've built for code. There's no "Git for documents,"=
 no staging environments for testing language, no continuous integration fo=
r collaborative writing. Documents remain static artifacts rather than livi=
ng, versioned, testable entities.
The multi-model future emerging today
The evidence suggests this is already changing. Users are manually construc=
ting document pipelines using different AI models for different tasks=E2=80=
=94Perplexity for research and fact-checking, Claude for analysis and compl=
ex reasoning, GPT-4 for creative enhancement. The specialization mirrors ho=
w programmers use different tools for different aspects of development.
Platform builders are taking notice. Notion integrated Claude directly into=
 its workspace, eliminating the need for separate AI tools and reportedly s=
aving companies $35,000+ annually. Workflow automation platforms like n8n e=
nable visual construction of multi-model pipelines. Venture capital poured =
$100 billion into AI in 2024, with $45 billion specifically targeting gener=
ative AI applications.
What's emerging isn't just better spell-check or grammar correction. It's a=
n entirely new paradigm where documents become active participants in their=
 own creation, where different AI models collaborate like members of a deve=
lopment team, where writing workflows include staging, testing, and continu=
ous refinement.
Beyond the editor
The implications extend far beyond efficiency gains. When code gained versi=
on control, it didn't just reduce errors=E2=80=94it enabled global open-sou=
rce collaboration. When continuous integration emerged, it didn't just spee=
d deployment=E2=80=94it changed how software architects think about system =
design.
Similarly, when natural language gains its infrastructure, we won't just wr=
ite faster. We'll write differently. Imagine documents that maintain their =
own semantic version control, tracking not just changes but the evolution o=
f ideas. Envision staging environments where you can test how different aud=
iences will interpret your words before publishing. Consider continuous int=
egration for collaborative writing where multiple human and AI contributors=
 merge their work seamlessly.
The specialization of AI models points toward a future of ensemble composit=
ion. Just as modern software development involves designers, frontend devel=
opers, backend engineers, and DevOps specialists, document creation might i=
nvolve specialized AI models for research, argumentation, fact-checking, st=
yle consistency, and audience optimization=E2=80=94all orchestrated through=
 sophisticated pipelines.
The uncertainty ahead
I want to be clear about what remains speculation versus verified trend. We=
 know that programming's evolution delivered 200x+ improvements in deployme=
nt efficiency. We know natural language is computationally more complex tha=
n code. We know AI models can now understand language well enough to manipu=
late it meaningfully. We know knowledge workers waste enormous time on docu=
ment inefficiency.
What we don't know is how quickly this infrastructure will emerge, which pa=
radigms will dominate, or what new forms of expression will become possible=
=2E We're in the equivalent of 1975=20=
for natural language=E2=80=94version cont=
rol exists in primitive form, but Git won't arrive for another 30 years in =
relative terms.
The business models, technical standards, and cultural practices are all ye=
t to be determined. Will we see proprietary platforms dominate, or will ope=
n standards emerge? How will we handle the verification and attribution cha=
llenges that code doesn't face? What new forms of collaborative creativity =
will emerge?
A new literacy
Perhaps most profoundly, this transformation will require new literacies. J=
ust as modern programmers must understand version control, testing, and dep=
loyment pipelines, future writers will need to understand model orchestrati=
on, semantic versioning, and output verification. The skill won't be in cra=
fting perfect prose alone, but in designing systems that produce effective =
communication.
This isn't about replacing human creativity=E2=80=94it's about amplifying i=
t. When programmers gained sophisticated tooling, they didn't write less co=
de; they built things that were previously impossible. When writers gain eq=
uivalent infrastructure, we won't write less; we'll compose at scales and s=
peeds that transform how knowledge flows through organizations and society.
The parallel to programming's evolution gives us a roadmap, but natural lan=
guage's greater complexity ensures the journey will hold surprises. We're n=
ot just building better tools; we're creating infrastructure for humanity's=
 oldest and most powerful technology=E2=80=94language itself.
The revolution has begun. The only question is whether we'll recognize it i=
n time to shape its direction. Those who understand both the historical pat=
tern and the unique challenges of natural language will be best positioned =
to build the future of human expression.
After all, if code=E2=80=94a simplified protocol designed for machines=E2=
=80=94could undergo such dramatic evolution, imagine what's possible when w=
e finally build proper infrastructure for the full richness of human langua=
ge. The next 50 years of composition technology will make the last 50 years=
 of programming advancement look like a rehearsal.
The age of natural language engineering has arrived. We're all programmers =
now=E2=80=94we just use words instead of code.

=E2=80=99m looking for congruence. Think of this as pull request stuff. I=

language carries the full weight of human complexity=E2=80=94making this tr=

olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">To understand where=
 writing is headed, we need to understand where code has been. The transfor=
mation is staggering: in the 1960s, programmers literally wrote code on pun=
ch cards and hoped it would run when fed into a mainframe. Today, Amazon de=
ploys code every 11.7 seconds. That's not a typo=E2=80=94engineers push cha=

 fundamental innovations: version control systems (Git in 2005), continuous=
 integration (conceptualized in 1991, practical by 2001), automated testing=
 frameworks, and containerization. Each innovation built on the last, creat=

;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's where the =
story gets interesting. Programming languages were deliberately designed as=
 simplified communication protocols=E2=80=94context-free grammars that trad=
e expressiveness for computational tractability. They occupy a lower rung o=
n the Chomsky hierarchy than natural languages, which require context-sensi=
tive or mildly context-sensitive grammars for adequate description.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Natural language is orders of magnitude more complex. Where progra=
mming languages have deterministic parsing and unambiguous syntax, natural =
language thrives on ambiguity, context, and pragmatic inference. A single s=
entence like &quot;The horse raced past the barn fell&quot; can send our br=
ains into recursive loops trying to parse its garden-path structure. Progra=
mming languages can't express metaphor, irony, or the infinite creative pot=
ential of human language.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Yet this complexity is precisely =
why the transformation will be so powerful. When we finally build infrastru=
cture for the full expressiveness of human language, we won't just improve =
efficiency=E2=80=94we'll unlock new forms of collaborative intelligence.</p=

 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The watershed came on Ju=
ne 12, 2017, when Google researchers published &quot;Attention Is All You N=
eed.&quot; The transformer architecture didn't just improve natural languag=
e processing; it made it parallelizable and scalable in ways that suddenly =
made machine understanding of human language practical.</p><p style=3D"marg=

 progression since has been breathtaking. GPT-3 in 2020 demonstrated emerge=
nt abilities at 175 billion parameters. By 2023, models began exceeding hum=
an performance on standardized tests. Gemini Ultra became the first model t=
o surpass human experts on the MMLU benchmark at 90%. We've gone from stati=

xity on complex language tasks.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=

ile Silicon Valley celebrates AI breakthroughs, enterprises face a stark re=
ality: knowledge workers spend 20-35% of their time on document-related act=
ivities rather than actual knowledge creation. McKinsey's research shows wo=
rkers dedicate one full day per week just searching for and gathering infor=
mation. Fortune 500 companies lose an estimated $12 billion annually to doc=
ument inefficiency.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The statistics are sobering. Only 3% of=
 knowledge workers are satisfied with their company's document handling. 83=
% would rather recreate a document than search for it. Nearly half have dis=
covered they were working on the wrong version of a document. We've digitiz=

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">This inefficiency exists because we lack infrastructure for natural =

5,000+ annually. Workflow automation platforms like n8n enable visual const=
