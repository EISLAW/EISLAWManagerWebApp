I keep getting asked the same question: =E2=80=9CIs there an AI bubble, Nat=
e?=E2=80=9D
We=E2=80=99re not. But it=E2=80=99s been hard to yell loud enough to be hea=
rd over the tide of noise when everyone wants to believe we=E2=80=99re in a=
n AI bubble.
The bubble narrative is becoming a bubble.
But seriously, the thing that really bothers me is that none of this specul=
ation is free.
There is real risk here. People who believe AI is a bubble are going to spe=
nd the next 12-18 months thinking nothing will really change and by then it=
 will be too late.=20
If you=E2=80=99re familiar with Pascal=E2=80=99s Wager [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/37a58e79-6cdd-4de0-9676-a3e3fcca7211?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], this is taking the wrong end o=
f the bet.
So this post is all about helping you understand where we REALLY are in the=
 AI world, what that ACTUALLY means for jobs, and how to think about AI ski=
lls as a result.=20
Think of it as a companion to my Executive Briefing on AI fluency [ https:/=
/substack.com/redirect/ba26f00e-11e4-4323-a6fc-cd99a04cd264?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWt=
iOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] earlier this month. =
That piece focused on how to measure and build skills for your team.
This piece focuses on you as an individual=E2=80=94what skills do you need =
to survive and thrive in the new AI exponential world? How can we measure w=
here you=E2=80=99re at on AI exponential readiness (yes we can use AI to do=
 this) and how can we make sure that you have a thoughtful plan for how to =
move forward?
The heart of this piece came from a close read of Julian Schrittwieser=E2=
=80=99s excellent writing on AI exponentials. I=E2=80=99ve taken time in th=
is piece to dive into what Julian thinks, why it bursts the bubble narrativ=
e, and then I=E2=80=99ve extended his work into a novel thesis on why the e=
xponential gains we=E2=80=99re seeing WON=E2=80=99T disrupt jobs the way ma=
ny in the media assume.
Then I dig into what you DO need for the AI exponential future, and give yo=
u a prompt pack to give yourself an AI exponential readiness test and ident=
ify specific action steps you can take to get ready for the next few months=
=2E
Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s in the box:
A complete breakdown of Julian=E2=80=99s exponential thesis
The AI tests that show us exponential gain and can=E2=80=99t be gamed
The mechanism driving the exponential=20
Julian=E2=80=99s specific timeline predictions for AI
Why the =E2=80=9Cjobs are doomed=E2=80=9D thesis is wrong
What exponential gains DON=E2=80=99T mean
Breakdown of a new study on task automation
What this reveals about AI-Human working models
Bonus note for solo founders
My own deep dive on the skills that compound as AI capabilities grow
AI Direction (give the robot a job)
AI Evaluation (did it do a good job)
Task Decomposition (can the robot handle it)
Learning Velocity (are you fast at learning?)
Why these skills get MORE valuable as the exponential continues
Yes, they=E2=80=99re learnable
Your AI Exponential Fluency level-up:
Five scored assessments: curve reading, compound skill identification, cogn=
itive failure recognition, leverage positioning, signal reading
Takes 20-25 minutes with any LLM
Delivers positioning category, gap analysis, timing assessment, ranked 90-d=
ay action plan
Re-run quarterly to track improvement
Who needs this?
Anyone asking =E2=80=9Cis there an AI bubble?=E2=80=9D who wants the actual=
 data
Founders trying to figure out what they can attempt solo now
Teams wondering whether small + fluent beats large + casual
Engineers, PMs, consultants, researchers trying to read capability curves t=
hemselves
People who want to stop debating and start building the skills that compoun=
d
Anyone who doesn=E2=80=99t want to miss the exponential while everyone else=
 is still arguing about whether it exists
Why am I writing this? Because there=E2=80=99s a peculiar information asymm=
etry happening right now. People inside the labs=E2=80=94the researchers bu=
ilding these systems=E2=80=94see explosive progress on metrics that matter =
economically. People outside see chatbots making mistakes and conclude we=
=E2=80=99ve plateaued.
That gap is dangerous. The preparation window is closing fast. If capabilit=
ies are doubling every few months, waiting 6-12 months to get fluent means =
you=E2=80=99re always catching up while the gap widens.
I don=E2=80=99t know if Julian=E2=80=99s exact timeline is right. Could be =
18 months, could be 36. But I know how to read the curve myself now, and I =
want you to learn that too.
Because exponentials are hard to time but easy to miss entirely if you=E2=
=80=99re not paying attention.
Let=E2=80=99s learn to think in exponentials, and skill up!

YES, I specifically built this to go with my Executive Briefing AI fluency =
assessment [ https://substack.com/redirect/ba26f00e-11e4-4323-a6fc-cd99a04c=

 This one is designed to measure your ability to adapt as AI continues to g=
ain capabilities rapidly=E2=80=94as the exponential takes hold. As before, =
it=E2=80=99s a series of prompts you can use to talk to an LLM like ChatGPT=
 and assess your readiness, plus a score overall. Have fun and good luck ri=
ding the curve!
How to Think in Exponentials: What Julian Schrittwieser=E2=80=99s AI Predic=
tions Mean for All of Us
I keep seeing the same pattern. People argue about whether AI is overhyped =
while the actual capability curves just keep climbing. And most people miss=
 it completely=E2=80=94the same way so many of us missed exponential COVID =
growth until it was too late.
Here=E2=80=99s what I mean: while the industry as a whole was debating the =
AI bubble (especially in the last month), autonomous task length has been o=
n a doubling pace for over 18 months now: from 15 minutes to 2+ hours. That=
=E2=80=99s not hype. That=E2=80=99s measured capability growth from METR, a=
n independent AI safety organization that tracks how long models can work w=
ithout human intervention. Specifically METR measures how long a human-equi=
valent task a model can complete.=20
So in this case models can now autonomously complete tasks that take humans=
 two hours, with (of course) anecdotes of much much longer tasks getting do=
ne in certain situations. I know a Principal PM who used a nicely formatted=
 Deep Research prompt to save himself ~3 months of human work, for instance=
=2E
I=E2=80=99ve mentioned METR before. I like them because they are hard to ga=
me. Julian Schrittwieser likes them too. He=E2=80=99s the researcher who bu=
ilt AlphaGo, MuZero, and now works at Anthropic, and he is someone to liste=
n to when he has an opinion.
In this case, he=E2=80=99s gone on the record saying we=E2=80=99re missing =
the exponential again, and says we=E2=80=99ve all got maybe 18 months befor=
e the AI exponential scales past human expertise in many areas. And here=E2=
=80=99s the thing: he=E2=80=99s not guessing. He=E2=80=99s reading data mos=
t people can=E2=80=99t see, pointing at data (like METR) we CAN see, and he=
=E2=80=99s already been proven right once when he called out the original d=
oubling law for autonomous agent execution.
The question I want you to wrestle with isn=E2=80=99t whether to trust his =
specific timeline. It=E2=80=99s whether you know how to read exponential cu=
rves yourself, and whether you=E2=80=99re building the skills that compound=
 as AI capabilities accelerate. Because if Schrittwieser is even directiona=
lly correct, the gap between people who figured out AI fluency in 2025 and =
people who figure it out in 2027 could be two years of compounding advantag=
e.=20
That=E2=80=99s not a gap you make up.
Why You Should Listen to Julian Schrittwieser
So who is this Julian guy?
Julian Schrittwieser isn=E2=80=99t making predictions from the sidelines. H=
e spent the last decade inside the two labs=E2=80=94Google DeepMind and Ant=
hropic=E2=80=94that have arguably made the most significant breakthroughs i=
n AI. And his track record isn=E2=80=99t just impressive, it=E2=80=99s a hi=
ghlight reel of =E2=80=9Cimpossible=E2=80=9D achievements that became reali=
ty.
He built AlphaGo, the system that beat world Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016 =
when most experts said it wouldn=E2=80=99t happen for another decade. Then =
he made AlphaGo Zero, which learned from scratch without any human games. T=
hen MuZero, which learned to play games without even knowing the rules. The=
n AlphaCode, which writes competitive programming solutions. Then AlphaTens=
or, which discovered new algorithms for matrix multiplication. And AlphaPro=
of, which proves mathematical theorems.
When he talks about exponential progress, he=E2=80=99s describing the syste=
ms he=E2=80=99s building, not speculating about someone else=E2=80=99s work=
=2E He sees internal evaluations showin=
g capability improvements months befor=
e they become public. He watches competing labs=E2=80=94OpenAI, Anthropic, =
DeepMind=E2=80=94hit the same exponential slopes independently, which sugge=
sts they=E2=80=99re all discovering the same fundamental scaling laws rathe=
r than gaming benchmarks.
Here=E2=80=99s why his credibility matters: he=E2=80=99s been proven right =
before when everyone else was wrong. When AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in 2016, i=
t was his system that made the remarkable Move 37. It was a move that viola=
ted basic Go strategy, that experts called a mistake, that later proved opt=
imal. That moment demonstrated AI discovering solutions humans hadn=E2=80=
=99t even considered. Schrittwieser was core to making that happen.
So when he says we=E2=80=99re in an exponential regime and people are missi=
ng it, I pay attention. And that=E2=80=99s exactly what he=E2=80=99s saying=
 in his blog [ https://substack.com/redirect/70e5659a-9a33-4481-90a3-871d92=
5ee837?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 =
], and on a 70 minute podcast that released this week.
Why I=E2=80=99m Writing This
Look, I need to be direct about something. If you=E2=80=99re in San Francis=
co, if you visit the frontier labs, if you talk to people who are on the cu=
tting edge of AI research, none of them are saying we=E2=80=99ve hit a wall=
=2E And it=E2=80=99s not just the people w=
ith gigantic piles of equity like S=
am Altman who have the incentive to pump things up. It=E2=80=99s researcher=
s like Julian who are just trying to understand how to make systems work be=
tter.
And yet I keep getting asked from OUTSIDE SF: =E2=80=9CIs there an AI bubbl=
e, Nate?=E2=80=9D
I gotta say, I see the same thing Julian sees. I don=E2=80=99t see evidence=
 of a bubble. And I=E2=80=99m really glad he did this podcast and blog post=
 because he articulates it better than I can. There=E2=80=99s a peculiar in=
formation asymmetry happening right now=E2=80=94people building these syste=
ms see explosive progress in metrics that matter economically, while the ou=
tside world debates whether we=E2=80=99ve plateaued.
That gap matters. And I want to close it.
So what=E2=80=99s in Julian=E2=80=99s blog post?
On September 27, 2024, Schrittwieser published =E2=80=9CFailing to Understa=
nd the Exponential, Again=E2=80=9D on his personal blog. The title alone te=
lls you everything: he=E2=80=99s calling out the same cognitive failure tha=
t happened with COVID-19, where politicians and commentators dismissed expo=
nential case growth even when the data was screaming at them.
His argument cuts through the noise. People see models making mistakes and =
conclude AI will never work, completely ignoring that these same tasks were=
 impossible science fiction three years ago. They compare two consecutive m=
odel releases, don=E2=80=99t notice much difference in casual ChatGPT conve=
rsations, and declare scaling is over. All while missing the exponential tr=
endline that=E2=80=99s visible in rigorous evaluations.
I=E2=80=99ve been after Wall Street and journalists both for missing this f=
or awhile now, and both camps have been instrumental in peddling the AI bub=
ble narrative in the last month. And don=E2=80=99t get me wrong: the narrat=
ive is real (even if the facts are not).
This graph is wrong, and Julian and I are both right.
Here=E2=80=99s Julian=E2=80=99s argument: we can see evidence of a reliably=
 predictable exponential on metrics that matter across multiple measures th=
at cannot be gamed.
Let=E2=80=99s dive into what he means:=20
First, METR measured how long AI can work autonomously on software engineer=
ing tasks. The result: capability doubles every 7 months, growing from roug=
hly 15-minute tasks to 2+ hour tasks in seven months. That=E2=80=99s not a =
projection. That=E2=80=99s what actually happened.
Second, OpenAI=E2=80=99s GDPval evaluated AI performance across 1,320 real =
work tasks spanning 44 professions=E2=80=94lawyers, doctors, consultants, e=
ngineers=E2=80=94graded by experienced professionals who couldn=E2=80=99t t=
ell if they were rating human or AI work. The result: the same exponential =
slope, with Claude Opus 4.1 already matching human expert performance acros=
s industries.
Now here=E2=80=99s what separates this from typical AI hype: METR published=
 their finding that autonomous task duration doubles every seven months. Se=
ven months later, new models from competing labs=E2=80=94Anthropic=E2=80=99=
s Opus 4.1, xAI=E2=80=99s Grok 4, OpenAI=E2=80=99s GPT-5=E2=80=94were relea=
sed and landed exactly where the math predicted.
This wasn=E2=80=99t curve-fitting after the fact. It was a forecast that he=
ld up when tested by independent companies racing against each other. That=
=E2=80=99s the difference between hype and signal.
And by the way, Julian specifically praised OpenAI for publishing GDPval ev=
en though Anthropic=E2=80=99s model performed best. That=E2=80=99s intellec=
tual integrity=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re not trying to game their own benchma=
rks, they=E2=80=99re trying to measure real capability.
One more thing, GDPVal was published for the first time AFTER the models it=
 measured were released. Again, the models couldn=E2=80=99t be trained to g=
ame it. And Julian is correct that OpenAI admitting Claude was better reinf=
orces the integrity of the measure.
How Tech Drives an Exponential
So what about it? What is making this exponential believable and not just c=
orrelation? Julian gets into that as well.
Understanding the mechanism matters because it helps you evaluate whether t=
he exponential can continue or will hit fundamental limits. And the mechani=
sm is actually elegant once you see it.
Pre-training=E2=80=94reading massive amounts of human-written text, code, a=
nd data=E2=80=94accomplishes two things simultaneously. First, it builds an=
 internal model of how the world works by predicting what comes next, which=
 requires understanding cause and effect, physical constraints, and human b=
ehavior. Second, it instills baseline alignment by observing what humans va=
lue and care about.
Here=E2=80=99s something most people don=E2=80=99t know: Reddit has mostly =
been purged from frontier model training data. It wasn=E2=80=99t high enoug=
h quality. The training corpus now focuses much more heavily on very curate=
d sources, like scientific papers, high-quality books, and curated text. Th=
at matters because starting with a clean, excellent corpus of human knowled=
ge gives you both efficiency and safety benefits=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re not=
 trying to filter out garbage after the fact.
This is why starting from scratch isn=E2=80=99t necessary. Human data provi=
des both the knowledge base and the value system.
After pre-training, reinforcement learning enables trial-and-error improvem=
ent. Here=E2=80=99s the crucial breakthrough that makes this exponential ra=
ther than linear: better AI generates better training data for itself.
An intermediate-level coding AI writes intermediate-level code that can be =
automatically checked for correctness. That becomes training data for reach=
ing advanced-level capability. Then advanced AI generates harder problems, =
creating a flywheel where improvement accelerates because you=E2=80=99re no=
t constrained by =E2=80=9Chow much human-generated data exists?=E2=80=9D
This data generation mechanism is why concerns about training data exhausti=
on miss the point. The bottleneck shifts from =E2=80=9Chow much human data =
is available?=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Chow efficiently can models explore and e=
valuate solution spaces?=E2=80=9D As long as you can automatically verify c=
orrectness=E2=80=94which you can for code, math, science, and increasingly =
other domains=E2=80=94the model generates its own curriculum.
Schrittwieser spent significant podcast time explaining why this took years=
 to scale. Not theoretical barriers, but engineering challenges around stab=
ility (RL training can be unstable), feedback loop complexity (how do you p=
rovide useful learning signal?), and infrastructure (running millions of ev=
aluations to generate training data requires enormous computation). The lab=
s that figured out these engineering problems first are now seeing exponent=
ial returns.
The Move 37 concept helps understand what=E2=80=99s possible when you combi=
ne search with learning. AlphaGo=E2=80=99s famous move violated basic Go st=
rategy, looked like a mistake to expert players, then proved optimal. This =
demonstrated AI finding solutions by exploring possibilities rather than mi=
micking human play.
Modern language models show similar behavior in programming and mathematics=
=E2=80=94generating approaches that surprise domain experts but prove corre=
ct upon examination. This matters because it means AI can make genuine disc=
overies rather than just remix existing knowledge.
The prediction of Nobel-level breakthroughs by 2027-28 isn=E2=80=99t about =
AI reading all the papers faster than humans. It=E2=80=99s about AI explori=
ng solution spaces=E2=80=94potential drug compounds, material structures, m=
athematical approaches=E2=80=94more thoroughly than human intuition can gui=
de. AlphaGo didn=E2=80=99t just play like the best humans. It found moves t=
he best humans hadn=E2=80=99t considered. The same dynamic could apply to s=
cientific discovery.
So What About Humans?
This is where most analysis goes wrong. The question isn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=
=9Cwhat skills survive AI?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cwhat skil=
ls compound as AI capabilities grow?=E2=80=9D
Julian is very clear that he views AI skills as critical, but that fundamen=
tally he sees a future of AI-human collaboration as the future of work. So =
do I.
I went a bit farther than Julian and named some skills I think pop out as u=
seful:
AI Direction (the ability to direct AI usefully and efficiently) is the met=
a-skill that matters most. Can you take a fuzzy problem and decompose it in=
to clear, executable instructions? This isn=E2=80=99t about knowing magic p=
rompts. It=E2=80=99s about understanding what you want well enough to speci=
fy it precisely, recognizing what context AI needs that you haven=E2=80=99t=
 provided, and iterating efficiently when the first attempt misses. This sk=
ill gets better with deliberate practice and increases in leverage as AI ca=
pabilities grow. The person who can nail the specification in one conversat=
ion versus ten has a 10x time advantage that compounds across every task.
AI Evaluation means catching when outputs are brilliant versus plausible-so=
unding nonsense. This isn=E2=80=99t about knowing everything=E2=80=94it=E2=
=80=99s pattern recognition for =E2=80=9Cdoes this make sense given the con=
straints?=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwhat assumptions did I forget to specify?=
=E2=80=9D As AI gets better, the errors get subtler, making evaluation more=
 rather than less valuable. The people who develop strong evaluation instin=
cts become quality gates for high-stakes decisions. They=E2=80=99re the dif=
ference between =E2=80=9Cwe can use AI for this=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwe ca=
n=E2=80=99t trust AI for this.=E2=80=9D
Task Decomposition is knowing what to delegate to AI versus what to do your=
self. Not based on fixed rules like =E2=80=9CAI can=E2=80=99t do creative w=
ork=E2=80=9D (wrong=E2=80=94AI can generate hundreds of creative options), =
but situational judgment: =E2=80=9CAI can explore this solution space in te=
n minutes, I=E2=80=99ll pick the right direction in thirty seconds.=E2=80=
=9D The skill is recognizing which tasks benefit from AI=E2=80=99s breadth =
(generation, exploration, iteration) versus human strengths (taste, strateg=
ic direction, final decisions under ambiguity).
Learning Velocity is a must. AI capabilities are changing every month, lite=
rally. Waiting for =E2=80=9Cbest practices=E2=80=9D to emerge means you=E2=
=80=99re always 6-12 months behind. The skill is adopting new capabilities =
fast, learning what works through experimentation, and moving to the next c=
apability before others have mastered the last one. This is classic builder=
 mentality, just operating at higher speed.
These are large skill clusters in reality. They need to be operable across =
multiple toolsets and evolve themselves as AI evolves. These skills compoun=
d because each improvement in AI capability multiplies their value. Getting=
 10% better at AI direction when models can handle 30-minute tasks means yo=
u save 3 minutes per task. Getting 10% better when models can handle 3-hour=
 tasks means you save 18 minutes. The same skill improvement has 6x more im=
pact.
This is why early investment in these skills has asymmetric returns=E2=80=
=94you=E2=80=99re building capabilities that become more valuable as the ex=
ponential continues.
No, AI Will Not Take the Jobs
But here=E2=80=99s what almost everyone gets wrong when they look at these =
curves. They see METR showing exponential growth in autonomous work duratio=
n=E2=80=9415 minutes to 2+ hours=E2=80=94and they immediately jump to =E2=
=80=9CAI is going to automate all the jobs.=E2=80=9D
That=E2=80=99s not what=E2=80=99s happening. And the data proves it. Julian=
 did NOT get into this as much, so I=E2=80=99m bringing in my own research =
and data here and making what I believe is a novel articulation of a jobs t=
hesis in the age of AI:
Exponential gains in AI agent execution time will not translate into full a=
utomation, because jobs are much more complex than a sum of tasks.
In other words, you can get a LOT better at task delegation on even big tas=
ks and make almost no progress on automation. This gets back to Polanyi=E2=
=80=99s Paradox [ https://substack.com/redirect/c4633f2c-7662-4106-9c6a-058=
2c3597e73?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPO=
w0 ], which I=E2=80=99ve written about before.
And the data is starting to show exactly that.
The Remote Labor Index from Scale AI and the Center for AI Safety tested AI=
=E2=80=99s ability to fully automate hundreds of real-world projects from r=
emote work platforms. These are actual tasks that matter economically=E2=80=
=94software development, architecture, game development, scientific documen=
t preparation. The kind of work that METR measures in terms of hours of aut=
onomous activity.
Current automation rate: less than 3%.
Think about what this means. Autonomous work duration is growing exponentia=
lly. But full task automation remains near zero. These aren=E2=80=99t contr=
adictory findings=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re revealing something crucial about=
 how this exponential actually manifests.
The 15 minutes to 2+ hours curve means AI can handle longer stretches of wo=
rk within a human-directed workflow. The sub-3% automation rate means it=E2=
=80=99s not remotely on track to replace entire projects or jobs independen=
tly. AI is becoming dramatically better at executing within context, but it=
 still needs humans to set direction, provide judgment, and handle the ambi=
guous parts.=20
In other words, there is a low gear ratio between having an agent work for =
awhile and actually seeing full role automation. The former doesn=E2=80=99t=
 touch enough of the complexity of a real job to really replace a human.
This is the most data-backed version of Julian=E2=80=99s complementarity th=
esis. The exponential is real. The capabilities are real. But what we=E2=80=
=99re seeing isn=E2=80=99t wholesale replacement=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s colla=
boration leverage. Humans + AI doing 10x more work, not AI doing 100% of th=
e work.
I=E2=80=99m already seeing this with solo founders. They=E2=80=99re able to=
 pick up their weak spots=E2=80=94the marketing they=E2=80=99ve always stru=
ggled with, the financial modeling they=E2=80=99ve avoided, the code they n=
ever had time to write properly=E2=80=94in ways that solo founders have tra=
ditionally just had to suffer through. They=E2=80=99re not getting replaced=
=2E They=E2=80=99re getting superpowers in=
 their weak areas while staying foc=
used on their strengths.
This is what 10x productivity actually looks like in practice. Not one pers=
on replaced by AI, but one person empowered to do what used to require a te=
am. The exponential shows up as capability expansion, not capability replac=
ement.
Sidebar: for those saying I need to wait 6 months and then things will be m=
ore doom-filled, I say=E2=80=94I just did. I=E2=80=99ve heard that argument=
 since early last year in fact. And I am not seeing evidence that rapidly s=
caling intelligence gains are leading to huge chunks of jobs getting automa=
ted reliably.
As an example: no software engineer will tell you their job is in danger if=
 they are worth any salt. And yet code is where automation is supposed to h=
it first! Gergely Orosz has laid out exactly why engineering is more than c=
oding over the last year in a series of posts, and I encourage you to read =
him if you=E2=80=99re wondering.=20
How to Measure Your Own Fluency
The trap is treating AI fluency as binary=E2=80=94you either have it or you=
 don=E2=80=99t. The reality is it=E2=80=99s a spectrum that you can measure=
 and improve deliberately.
It=E2=80=99s much more complex than that, and I built a whole diagnostic to=
 help you figure out how well positioned you are for an exponential world. =
I love it so much I am putting it in this post twice, just in case you miss=
ed it at the top.
You grab your AI exponential diagnostic here [ https://substack.com/redirec=

QJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
A Few Closing Thoughts for Builders
If Schrittwieser is directionally correct about exponential capability grow=
th, three dynamics reshape how you should think about building.
First, leverage becomes everything. One person with strong AI fluency can o=
utput what used to require a team. This has profound implications for what =
you can attempt solo. The ambitious product that seemed to require raising =
money for a team of 5-8 people might now be tractable if you=E2=80=99re exc=
ellent at AI direction. Capital requirements for software businesses are co=
llapsing, but fluency requirements are rising. Small teams with deep AI cap=
abilities beat large teams with casual AI usage, and the gap is widening.
Second, speed compounds differently. You can iterate 10x faster on implemen=
tation, which means you can try 10x more ideas, which means you find produc=
t-market fit faster. But the advantage isn=E2=80=99t just =E2=80=9Cbuild fa=
ster=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Clearn faster.=E2=80=9D Running =
100 experiments in the time competitors run 10 creates an information advan=
tage that accumulates. Early experimentation when others are still cautious=
 produces disproportionate learning.
Third, first-mover advantage intensifies. If capabilities are doubling ever=
y 7 months, getting fluent now versus waiting 6-12 months could mean the di=
fference between leading and catching up. People who figure out AI leverage=
 in 2025 have time to establish themselves, build proof of what=E2=80=99s p=
ossible, and develop advanced skills before it becomes obvious to everyone.=
 The window where being early provides meaningful advantage might be shorte=
r than in previous technology transitions because the capability growth is =
faster.
Look, I say this all the time but it bears repeating: the preparation windo=
w is closing fast. If you can draw straight lines on a chart and you see th=
em going up exponentially, we have to get ready for this now. There=E2=80=
=99s not another moment. It will not get easier if you wait six months. The=
 skills that compound=E2=80=94direction, evaluation, decomposition, learnin=
g velocity=E2=80=94they build on each other over time. Starting later means=
 you=E2=80=99re always playing catch-up while the gap widens.
The smart move is learning to read the exponential yourself. Watch the metr=
ics that matter: autonomous task duration, evaluation scores on real work, =
adoption patterns in leading companies. Track your own fluency improvements=
=2E Build the skills that compound rega=
rdless of whether the timeline is 18 m=
onths or 36 months.
Exponentials are hard to time but easy to miss entirely if you=E2=80=99re n=
ot paying attention.
The Optimistic Frame
I want to be clear about something. I do think the evidence is starting to =
point us toward abundance, not replacement. One person can do much more tha=
n before BUT we don=E2=80=99t see real evidence that indicates dispensing w=
ith the human touch is going to be good, profitable, or useful anytime soon=
=2E And as this post argues, we=E2=80=99re=
 starting to see evidence that AI i=
s in fact best positioned as a helper for humans.
All this means that small companies can compete with large ones. Ambitious =
projects become tractable. The barriers to building are collapsing for peop=
le who invest in fluency.
If you=E2=80=99re scrappy, learn fast, and willing to iterate, the next 12-=
24 months represent the highest-leverage skill-building period in decades. =
The question isn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cwill AI replace me?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94it=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Chow fast can I learn to leverage AI to build things tha=
t were previously impossible?=E2=80=9D
Schrittwieser=E2=80=99s thesis isn=E2=80=99t doomer. It=E2=80=99s not even =
primarily about jobs or displacement. It=E2=80=99s about recognizing that w=
e=E2=80=99re in an exponential growth phase for AI capabilities, and that e=
xponentials create massive opportunities for people who understand them ear=
ly.
The people who win aren=E2=80=99t the ones who predict the exact timeline. =
They=E2=80=99re the ones who develop the skills that compound as capabiliti=
es grow, who build when others are still debating, who learn in public whil=
e others wait for certainty. They=E2=80=99re the ones who read the curve th=
emselves rather than waiting for experts to tell them what to think.
Learn to think in exponentials. Measure your fluency. Build the skills that=
 compound.
Everything else is noise.

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">I keep seeing the same pattern. People argue about whether AI is ove=
rhyped while the actual capability curves just keep climbing. And most peop=
le miss it completely=E2=80=94the same way so many of us missed exponential=
 COVID growth until it was too late.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>Here=E2=80=99s w=
hat I mean: while the industry as a whole was debating the AI bubble (espec=
ially in the last month), autonomous task length has been on a doubling pac=
e for over 18 months now: from 15 minutes to 2+ hours. That=E2=80=99s not h=
ype. That=E2=80=99s measured capability growth from METR, an independent AI=
 safety organization that tracks how long models can work without human int=
ervention. Specifically METR measures how long a </span><em>human-equivalen=

20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So in this =
case models can now autonomously complete tasks that take humans two hours,=
 with (of course) anecdotes of much much longer tasks getting done in certa=
in situations. I know a Principal PM who used a nicely formatted Deep Resea=

 and says we=E2=80=99ve all got maybe 18 months before the AI exponential s=
cales past human expertise in many areas. And here=E2=80=99s the thing: he=
=E2=80=99s not guessing. He=E2=80=99s reading data most people can=E2=80=99=

 When AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in 2016, it was his system that made the remar=

METR measured how long AI can work autonomously on software engineering tas=
ks. The result: capability doubles every 7 months, growing from roughly 15-=
minute tasks to 2+ hour tasks in seven months. That=E2=80=99s not a project=

: METR published their finding that autonomous task duration doubles every =
seven months. Seven months later, new models from competing labs=E2=80=94An=
thropic=E2=80=99s Opus 4.1, xAI=E2=80=99s Grok 4, OpenAI=E2=80=99s GPT-5=E2=

 by the way, Julian specifically praised OpenAI for publishing GDPval even =

=E2=80=94reading massive amounts of human-written text, code, and data=E2=
=80=94accomplishes two things simultaneously. First, it builds an internal =
model of how the world works by predicting what comes next, which requires =
understanding cause and effect, physical constraints, and human behavior. S=
econd, it instills baseline alignment by observing what humans value and ca=
re about.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=

 wasn=E2=80=99t high enough quality. The training corpus now focuses much m=
ore heavily on very curated sources, like scientific papers, high-quality b=

><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=

engineering challenges around stability (RL training can be unstable), feed=
back loop complexity (how do you provide useful learning signal?), and infr=
astructure (running millions of evaluations to generate training data requi=

oughts for Builders</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If Schrittwieser is directionally corr=
ect about exponential capability growth, three dynamics reshape how you sho=
uld think about building.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First, leverage becomes everythin=
g. One person with strong AI fluency can output what used to require a team=
. This has profound implications for what you can attempt solo. The ambitio=
us product that seemed to require raising money for a team of 5-8 people mi=
ght now be tractable if you=E2=80=99re excellent at AI direction. Capital r=
equirements for software businesses are collapsing, but fluency requirement=
s are rising. Small teams with deep AI capabilities beat large teams with c=
asual AI usage, and the gap is widening.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, speed comp=
ounds differently. You can iterate 10x faster on implementation, which mean=
s you can try 10x more ideas, which means you find product-market fit faste=
r. But the advantage isn=E2=80=99t just =E2=80=9Cbuild faster=E2=80=9D=E2=
=80=94it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Clearn faster.=E2=80=9D Running 100 experiments =
in the time competitors run 10 creates an information advantage that accumu=
lates. Early experimentation when others are still cautious produces dispro=
portionate learning.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Third, first-mover advantage intensifi=
es. If capabilities are doubling every 7 months, getting fluent now versus =
waiting 6-12 months could mean the difference between leading and catching =
up. People who figure out AI leverage in 2025 have time to establish themse=
lves, build proof of what=E2=80=99s possible, and develop advanced skills b=
efore it becomes obvious to everyone. The window where being early provides=
 meaningful advantage might be shorter than in previous technology transiti=
ons because the capability growth is faster.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Look, I say th=
is all the time but it bears repeating: the preparation window is closing f=
ast. If you can draw straight lines on a chart and you see them going up ex=
ponentially, we have to get ready for this now. There=E2=80=99s not another=
 moment. It will not get easier if you wait six months. The skills that com=
pound=E2=80=94direction, evaluation, decomposition, learning velocity=E2=80=
=94they build on each other over time. Starting later means you=E2=80=99re =
always playing catch-up while the gap widens.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The smart mov=
e is learning to read the exponential yourself. Watch the metrics that matt=
er: autonomous task duration, evaluation scores on real work, adoption patt=
erns in leading companies. Track your own fluency improvements. Build the s=
kills that compound regardless of whether the timeline is 18 months or 36 m=
onths.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
