If you=E2=80=99re reading this, you already sense the tectonic shifts under=
way=E2=80=94AI isn=E2=80=99t coming, it=E2=80=99s here. Let=E2=80=99s cut t=
he generic forecasts: you don=E2=80=99t need more vague predictions about w=
hether AI creates or kills jobs. You need precise, actionable intel on how =
AI reshapes your specific role, impacts your daily tasks, and shifts salari=
es.
Every other report treats the workforce as a broad blur. This guide is diff=
erent.
It dives deeply into 15 critical roles, mapping exactly how each mutates: w=
hich tasks vanish, which elevate, and which skills command salary premiums.=
 For example, you=E2=80=99ll learn why:
Software Engineers are seeing entry-level coding tasks vanish overnight, re=
placed by niche, hyper-valuable roles like GPU-cost tuning specialists who =
now command $250/hour.
Data Scientists face a rapid commoditization of traditional model-building =
because of AutoML=E2=80=94yet simultaneously find surging opportunities in =
AI auditing, bias detection, and ethical model oversight, commanding premiu=
ms that push salaries into the $220K range.
Vector Database Engineers, once obscure, are now one of tech=E2=80=99s hott=
est roles, with demand outstripping supply 4-to-1 and salaries rapidly appr=
oaching $300K.
Customer Success professionals face existential pressure as tier-one troubl=
eshooting evaporates=E2=80=94thanks to Sam Altman openly declaring frontlin=
e support as =E2=80=9Ctotally gone=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94but see new roles like =
strategic =E2=80=9CAI-Success Orchestrators=E2=80=9D emerge at salaries upw=
ards of $190K, centered around deep relationship management.
But this guide isn=E2=80=99t just about how existing roles evolve. It also =
reveals 12 entirely new roles=E2=80=94emerging roles without official title=
s yet, quietly forming the next high-value AI career opportunities. These a=
ren=E2=80=99t speculative=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re already beginning to crys=
tallize right now, even if your org chart hasn=E2=80=99t caught up yet. Rol=
es like:
Agent-Fleet Orchestrators, managing routing, resource allocation, and confl=
ict resolution between multiple autonomous AI agents=E2=80=94essential as e=
nterprises become agent-driven.
Context-Supply-Chain Managers, handling sophisticated version control for R=
etrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data, optimizing relevance, and ensurin=
g fresh, accurate context to enterprise-scale AI models=E2=80=94crucial inf=

g reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems=E2=80=94the hid=
den architects behind future AI behaviors.
Red-Team Psychologists, uniquely positioned at the intersection of security=
 and psychology, crafting adversarial prompts and systematically exploiting=
 LLM vulnerabilities=E2=80=94an absolute must-have skill set in an age of c=
onstant AI jailbreak threats.
Carbon-Aware Schedulers, who manage AI training runs based on real-time car=
bon intensity and ESG commitments=E2=80=94already emerging in leading-edge =
AI-first organizations prioritizing sustainability.
Edge-Inference Optimizers, specializing in distillation and quantization to=
 run AI efficiently on tiny devices=E2=80=94a role that will explode as int=
elligence moves into every physical device we touch.
Here=E2=80=99s why clarity at this depth matters and why you won=E2=80=99t =
find anything comparable anywhere else online:
Major industry reports (McKinsey, World Economic Forum) predict 92 million =
jobs displaced by 2030, while simultaneously millions of new roles emerge=
=E2=80=94but none drill down job-by-job, leaving you guessing about persona=
l risks and opportunities. Other research from Deloitte and Microsoft confi=
rms surging demand in certain roles=E2=80=94like cybersecurity specialists =
or AI ethics officers=E2=80=94but lacks specificity around exactly why thes=
e roles are exploding, or precisely how to position yourself to capture tho=
se salary spikes.
This guide exists because I=E2=80=99ve spoken personally with hundreds of t=
alented, worried professionals=E2=80=94real people uncertain how to pivot i=
n the face of AI-driven disruption. It matters deeply to me that you not on=
ly understand these seismic shifts but have a tactical map to navigate them=
 confidently.=20
This is part 3 in a loose trilogy I=E2=80=99ve been crafting on AI and jobs=
 over the last few weeks. If you=E2=80=99re interested, check out this note=
 on the hardest hitting questions on AI and jobs [ https://substack.com/red=

ocused on the job search and people=E2=80=99s worries. This piece is more i=
n-depth: it focuses on the jobs themselves and how they are evolving.
Full disclosure: You won=E2=80=99t find anything like this elsewhere. No on=

 upside, and emerging high-value skills at this level of detail and precisi=

AI and Jobs: The Four Dynamics Reshaping Every Career in 2025
I get asked this question more than any other: "Nate, what about my job?" A=
nd those jobs are all distinct and unique. Today, we're diving into the spe=
cifics=E2=80=94the big dynamics, the 15 roles getting hit hardest, and exac=
tly where the opportunities are hiding.
The TL;DR
Four seismic dynamics are reshaping work right now. AI isn't just coming fo=
r your job=E2=80=94it's creating massive new opportunities if you know wher=
e to look. AI proficiency now commands a ~28% salary premium, and professio=
nals with AI skills earn ~21% more than their peers. If I had to guess, bot=
h those numbers will be higher next year. The gap is widening. And you can =
evolve into the AI-enabled roles adjacent to what you do best=E2=80=94but o=
nly if you understand what's really happening beneath the headlines.
The Four Core Dynamics That Actually Matter
Dynamic 1: Automation Avalanche - Execution Getting Cheaper
You've seen the headlines. PMs expected to prompt-engineer their way to dou=
ble productivity. Engineers shipping twice as much code with Cursor. Custom=
er success doing "other things" because AI handles the tickets.
This is execution getting cheaper. It's real, it's happening now, and frank=
ly, it's the least interesting part of the story.
Dynamic 2: Trust Deficit - Speed Creates Quality Nightmares
Here's what nobody talks about: execution getting cheaper creates jobs beca=
use of quality and security disasters.
I know engineers who won't touch AI-generated code because it's "dirty." I =
know others who say it's fine=E2=80=94they rewrite it from scratch anyway. =
The point is, there are new security and quality challenges everywhere.
Example: Gina (35) is closing deals faster with ChatGPT, but she knows the =
bot hallucinated a roadmap feature to her customer. That's a credibility cr=
isis waiting to happen. 80% of presales professionals are using ChatGPT in =
their workflow=E2=80=94living with this constant risk.
Sales teams feed Slack threads and decks into ChatGPT before calls. They do=
n't prompt carefully. They get hallucinated presentations. Then the company=
 is committed to something AI made up.
If you can't figure out how to hedge your LLM so it only answers within a s=
pecified range, if you try to inject it and it responds with nonsense, you'=
re in trouble. These aren't edge cases=E2=80=94these are Tuesday afternoons=
 in 2025.
Dynamic 3: Infrastructure Tsunami - Compute Costs Exploding
AI engineers are experiencing exceptional demand in 2025, with average sala=
ries soaring to $206K=E2=80=94a huge $50K increase from the previous year. =
Why? Because compute costs are absolutely exploding.
Example: Mo (41) sees his monthly GPU bill eclipse his entire payroll. Not =
exaggeration=E2=80=94actual financial crisis. AI-ready data centers requiri=
ng $5.2 trillion of the $6.7 trillion compute capex by 2030. This is the la=
rgest infrastructure build in human history.
When compute costs explode, it creates a whole forest of downstream jobs. B=
eing able to tune GPU costs is lucrative business because everyone is hemor=
rhaging money on AI. There are whole forests of new roles that people don't=
 talk about much because they think of AI as scale-free. It's not.
Dynamic 4: Human-AI Boundary Crisis - Perfect Tech, Terrible UX
You can have perfect tech and still have users rage-quitting your chatbot. =
77% of UX professionals name ChatGPT their #1 GenAI tool but only 45% are s=
atisfied with results.
Humans and AI don't have interaction norms yet. There's vast confusion betw=
een the two. When someone tells you "AI is hallucinating," that sounds clea=
r to them. But it takes someone very technical to debug that. Is it an unde=
sired response? Lack of response? Over-complete response? Just the one some=
one noticed while 15 other examples went undetected?
That tension reveals the boundary crisis. Where there are problems like tha=
t, there are jobs.
The 15 Roles Getting Hit=E2=80=94and Where the Opportunities Are
15 Tech Roles in the AI Era
1. Product Manager
Product managers sit right in the middle of the automation and trust crisis=
=2E You need to scale your ability to m=
anage agents, become more technical, a=
nd you've never had more value in scaling trust.
Here's what matters: You need to be able to filter all the vibe-coded ideas=
 your organization generates. You need to be technical enough to have real =
conversations with engineering about AI models. You need to articulate a pa=
th forward that creates trust and deliver quality models in production.
When you do all that, you're talking about real value.
This highlights the age-old PM and MBA debate. MBAs aren't learning this st=
uff. If you need hard AI skills, you learn by building AI yourself or on th=
e job=E2=80=94there's no other way because academics isn't keeping up.
Everyone tells you to build as a PM, and you should. But here's what people=
 aren't telling you: the ability to earn trust in chaos matters more than a=
nything else. Product management has always been about managing chaos and e=
arning trust. AI multiplies that chaos, which means you have more opportuni=
ty than ever to earn trust. Nobody talks about this aspect enough.
2. Program and Project Manager
These folks are nervous when I talk to them. They worry that AI plans entir=
e programs better than they can. AI writes Slack messages, email updates, a=
nd AI agents schedule meetings. Where does the program manager go in this s=
cenario?
Here's what program managers really do: they're accountable for delivering =
against time, budget, and resources. LLMs aren't taking that accountability=
 away from humans.
You want AI tooling that builds Gantt charts? That makes sense. You want fl=
uency in AI to marshal resources and manage exploding AI projects? Absolute=
ly necessary. But the heart of the role is accountability, and that isn't g=
oing anywhere.
Great program managers understand that accountability is the beating heart =
of their role. You still need people who are accountable for outcomes. Infr=
astructure costs for AI are exploding, and more money pours into AI than ev=
er before. We need people who hold teams accountable to resource use.
3. Customer Success
This role always gets the black flag. Sam Altman talks about it going away =
completely, which makes me wonder why he's so focused on eliminating it.
The brilliant customer success people I know don't succeed by answering tic=
kets=E2=80=94they succeed by holding relationships. That's fundamentally hu=
man work that you can't get an LLM to handle effectively.
Customer success is sticking around, but it's leaning into relationship man=
agement. The person who advocates for customers internally=E2=80=94aggressi=
vely challenging those pesky PMs=E2=80=94and who talks with sales about exp=
ansion revenue isn't getting automated. The ticket stuff is getting automat=
ed, which is great=E2=80=94let AI handle that piece.
The beating heart of the role is the relationship, and that directly extend=
s the customer's lifetime value.
4. Software Engineering
I see people just out of college saying no one should study computer scienc=
e anymore. Don't run away from engineering right now.
You may have to change how you engineer, but this role has evolved more tim=
es than I can count over 70 years. Software engineering is compute-enabled =
by definition, so of course it evolves with AI. That's not a reason to walk=
 away from the field.
Do you know how many people need their vibe-coded work cleaned up? Insane a=
mounts of code get generated with security holes and quality issues. Going =
faster creates massive speed and quality problems.
AI makes you not care about technical debt if you want the prototype fast, =
and I understand that approach. But if you're production deploying, you hav=
e to build well.
The beating heart of good engineering is understanding how to design durabl=
e technical systems that scale. Some engineers lean toward prototyping=E2=
=80=94that's fantastic work. Some can code something up in a weekend that s=
hows how it works. I know engineers who do this brilliantly=E2=80=94they kn=
ock together something with real data in a weekend and call it a tracer bul=
let. People are wowed by this approach, and this skill isn't going out of s=
tyle.
Can you production deploy to 100 million boxes? This skill isn't going out =
of style either.
Don't let AI writing code confuse you about the fundamentals. You must lear=
n how technical systems get put together=E2=80=94that's the path to career =
leadership. Senior engineers worry about juniors over-depending on AI witho=
ut understanding fundamentals. The risk isn't that there will be no jobs; t=
he risk is that there will be no qualified people for jobs because they bel=
ieve AI will write code for them. That's simply not true.
5. Executive Leadership (Senior Managers and Directors)
Senior managers and directors=E2=80=94those chairs are at risk. I know peop=
le who feel it in their bones, and you're kind of right to be concerned.
Look at the dynamics, because none of them favor senior managers and direct=
ors. Faster execution doesn't help when your core job isn't execution. Spee=
d-trust-quality issues don't help because you're the one who has to deliver=
 anyway.
Middle managers are fundamentally information bottlenecks. Their entire job=
 has been filtering information for most of corporate history, and LLMs are=
 already good at filtering information.
People joke that the CEO should be AI. I think middle managers are more at =
risk=E2=80=94not of being replaced by an AI agent (I don't buy that throwaw=
ay line in Project Vend about Claudius being a middle manager). The role is=
 limited and somewhat endangered.
We'll still have directors and senior managers, but their spans will be muc=
h bigger. They'll be more stressed and will depend more on AI tooling to la=
dder up information flow. They'll chiefly exist as strategic accountability=
 points.
If the company is executing a strategy, you want to hand a big piece to som=
eone who's accountable for it=E2=80=94that's the director. You're going to =
hand that responsibility to the director, not an AI agent.
If you want to get ready for that reality, it's like the PM and program man=
ager roles. Get good at accountability. Get good at saying, "I can take thi=
s strategy and put legs on it with the people and resources I have with alm=
ost no direction from my VP or SVP. I can just go and execute it." That's t=
he heart of being a director.
If you are good at that, and if you are good at building AI cultures for yo=
ur team, you're probably going to be okay. But don't expect that role to gr=
ow=E2=80=94there won't be lots more directors because the dynamics aren't i=
n favor of job growth.
6. Data Scientists
The demand is skyrocketing for this role. People worry that data scientists=
 might not be doing well because there are research scientists for AI now. =
Maybe data scientists are becoming obsolete.
It's not working out that way at all. People have so many needs for data sc=
ience related to preparing their data for the AI age. This is one of the mo=
st blessed roles in the age of AI because there's so much data in the world=
 that has to be prepared for AI applications. There's so much custom work t=
hat needs to be done at the enterprise level to suit models to datasets. Da=
ta scientists are never bored.
The heart of the role is design=E2=80=94it's fundamentally a creative role.=
 People think it's not creative, but it absolutely is. I've worked with dat=
a scientists, and it's a really thoughtful role. It is not a role that is e=
asy to automate, and it is a role where quality matters tremendously. All o=
f those factors strongly argue for this trend of boosted demand for data sc=
ience being durable. I'm quite bullish on data science.
7. DevOps and Machine Learning Operations
Demand is exploding, especially for machine learning ops. People don't know=
 how to implement machine learning pipelines and operations effectively. If=
 you as a DevOps person can transition from helping developers deploy softw=
are effectively to helping AI engineers effectively deploy and maintain mod=
els, you're handling automation out of new chaos patterns=E2=80=94which is =
exactly what you've always done.
What you do in DevOps is fundamentally taking the herd of cats that is a bu=
nch of developers and figuring out how to get them into a clean production =
pipeline. Similarly, you now have a herd of cats that are ML engineers or A=
I engineers, and you have to herd them into an effective deployment pipelin=
e and effectively manage the model as it's in production.
If you are in DevOps or machine learning ops now, the beautiful thing is yo=
u are solving human problems. Engineers are not going out of style, and you=
 are still going to be needed to solve those human problems. Yes, there are=
 going to be AI tools that help you with the work.
But the heart of this work is helping to align the complex work of building=
 good software to production value. When do you deploy? Why do you deploy? =
How do you fix issues? What do fixes look like? How do you deploy securely?=
 What do your different environments look like? The heart of it is getting =
all of that aligned so you deliver value to the customer and solve problems=
 for engineers so they can focus on building software. Those are human prob=
lems you're solving, and those aren't going out of style.
8. UX and Human-AI Interaction Design
The problems of the human-AI boundary are real, and I see it happening all =
the time. The current AI interfaces are deeply imperfect and create a lot o=
f confusion for users.
We need to understand that as execution gets faster, UI craft is becoming m=
ore valuable because the cheap stuff is becoming more commoditized. If you =
have really polished UI, it's going to stand out more because the sea of th=
e internet is going to be filled with vibe-coded stuff that is not well-cra=
fted.
Let me give you an example that just came out. Perplexity has done a really=
 good job with UX interaction design. They just launched the ability to pas=
s a message to the AI as you read the chain of thought in the middle of a r=
esearch task. As far as I know, no one else lets you do that yet, and it's =
brilliant.
How many times have you as a user sat there and typed out a prompt, and the=
n thought, "I forgot to say this"? You have to add it and then wait for the=
 whole research prompt to run again. Not anymore. Now with Perplexity, you =
just pass the AI a note and it modifies its approach.
That is AI-enabled functionality, but it's also UX human interaction design=
=2E It's solving some of the human-AI b=
oundary issues because you're recogniz=
ing the old truth that humans are better at correcting mistakes we have mad=
e than checking our work beforehand. That's why good email systems will oft=
en give you a delay on send and an undo button=E2=80=94they know you instin=
ctively check your work after you send. That's UX design at work.
If you are designing for human-AI interaction, your world is getting richer=
 with opportunities. If you are designing for humans using AI systems, it's=
 the same kind of problem you've always solved. All of the systems we're us=
ing now are getting rapidly AI-enabled.
When people say, "Well, I'm not designing for AI," I respond, "But really?"=
 Because almost everything is getting AI-ified at a tremendous rate. If it'=
s not true for you now, it probably will be because your board is going to =
ask you to implement it soon. The trend is unbelievably pervasive.
This is not a case where UX professionals have to go and get AI experience =
because the AI experience is largely going to come to you. People are going=
 to be asking you to design these interactions. The challenge for you is to=
 think deeply about human-AI design and figure out how to build trust throu=
gh interactions.
I'll give you another example that we haven't solved yet: How do you take t=
he models we have, which are not good at taking accountability, and build i=
n interaction dynamics that track accountability over time for models? If I=
 tell the model, "That is incorrect, do not do that again," how can you sig=
npost that and indicate to the user that you have instructed the LLM in a s=
pecific way? Then on the back end, can you work with AI engineers to pass t=
hat as a prompt to remind the LLM, thus improving the experience of even si=
mple chatting because you're actually reinforcing accountability from the u=
ser?
There are a hundred different ideas like that around UX human interaction d=
esign. It's tremendous opportunity waiting to be explored.
9. Security and Red Team
There is a new AI jailbreak issue almost every day. Red teaming and securit=
y work=E2=80=94there are just not enough qualified people in the world. If =
you are able to start playing with jailbreaking, start playing with LLMs as=
 attack services, start looking at prompts for potential vulnerabilities, s=
tart looking at systematic vulnerability databases, and start reviewing vib=
e-coded pieces of work for security issues, you will never be out of work.
That represents an absolutely huge area of work. It requires the same set o=
f instincts that has made security people excel at what they do. I knew Gre=
yhat people back in the day, and it's the same instinct to go and try to me=
ss with systems and break them. Well, it turns out we have a whole new inte=
lligence surface and we have to jailbreak that to make it more secure. Ther=
e are huge opportunities in this space.
10. Cloud AI Infrastructure Engineers
This is where the infrastructure explosion is happening. You pay for yourse=
lf in this role by cutting spending. If you can find ways to master GPU arb=
itrage, to master the way you pass calls to the GPUs, and to master your cl=
oud infrastructure build, you're literally optimizing for what is collectiv=
ely the largest infrastructure build in human history.
AI data centers are on track for trillions of dollars in compute capital ex=
penditure by 2030. We're talking about six or seven trillion dollars, somet=
hing like that, and it'll probably be higher by the time we get there. They=
 need cloud AI engineers to avoid spending more money than they have to. At=
 that level, an engineer who can do their job well pays for their salary 10=
 or 100 times over in the way they handle these larger and larger fleets of=
 GPUs.
It's an incredibly valuable occupation. If you were already working in clou=
d as an engineer, you're well-prepared for this transition.
11. Data Engineering
This involves figuring out how to transition from ETLs into AI pipelines. Y=
ou may think AI is going to come for automated pipeline builds, but I don't=
 think you're realizing how much data is going to be needed and how much da=
ta preparation there will be. This is the same situation as with data scien=
ce=E2=80=94most of the failures I see in AI projects come from the data sid=
e.
If you are good at figuring out feature store governance, at figuring out v=
ector ETLs, and if you're good at figuring out how new data types can be ma=
de accessible and useful for business use cases, that's where the value lie=
s.
Extraordinary data engineers have always been distinguished by understandin=
g both the technical side of the business and the customer use case. In thi=
s case, you need to understand the AI customer use case, how AI is changing=
 what customers are expecting, the kinds of queries that are coming through=
, and then understand how the technical side enables that. You need to unde=
rstand how vectorizing data is different from storing data traditionally. I=
t's the same fundamental job, just with a new technology stack.
12. QA and AI Quality
This is an interesting area because we are fundamentally seeing a transform=
ation here, and I don't know of anyone talking about it enough. Right now, =
we are putting most of our energy into QA software before it launches. With=
 AI, we need to shift and put much more of our energy into QA as a durable =
quality threshold that is always active in production.
Why this shift? Because these systems produce probabilistic responses, whic=
h means you cannot deterministically test all this software. The value in Q=
A now is sustaining the value of the software and guarding it over time. Th=
at's the heart of QA=E2=80=94sustaining the quality of the software=E2=80=
=94but you get even more work to do because there's more complexity, and be=
cause quality must be sustained over time. You can't just launch and forget=
 the way you could with deterministic software.
This represents a major mindset shift. Most QA people I talk to are not rea=
dy for this world. They are used to P0, P1, P2 priorities=E2=80=94do the te=
st and launch. That mindset won't work in the AI era. I do worry a bit, not=
 because the jobs won't be there, but because the QA people I know aren't r=
eally thinking this way yet. This is an area where a mindset shift is absol=
utely critical.
13. Sales and Solutions Engineers
These roles can be very popular. Forward deployed engineers is another term=
 for this type of work. Some people say that's different, but it's very sim=
ilar. This is a case where AI is a powerful enabler for this job=E2=80=94yo=
u can code something up very quickly that demonstrates a personalized solut=
ion for the customer effectively.
The challenge is you also have the quality component to consider. It's on y=
ou as the forward deployed or solutions engineer to know what is actually d=
oable from your product technically, and to vibe code or quickly code only =
those things that you can actually reliably deliver.
You are also on the front lines of one of the most interesting trends in B2=
B SaaS. Because speed and execution are getting better at the code level, i=
t is possible to extend SaaS frameworks in ways that weren't possible befor=
e. When I was coming up in product, we were always taught to say no=E2=80=
=94PM says no. We were always taught to say no because you couldn't extend =
the software because it was so expensive to code.
It's not expensive to code anymore=E2=80=94it's cheap. If it's not expensiv=
e to code anymore, then you should be able to extend and personalize the so=
ftware more, which means more opportunities for sales and solutions enginee=
rs, as long as you are careful about quality. I know a lot of solutions eng=
ineers who want to advocate for the customer and lean in on customization. =
Just make sure that you know the software stack you're working with and you=
 don't overcommit to what you can deliver.
14. Edge Engineers
These are people who can put intelligence into smaller devices. This one is=
 brand new=E2=80=94this is not a role that exists widely right now. There a=
re absolutely indie hackers out there who love to build LLMs onto small dev=
ices. They think, "Let me run it on my laptop. Let me quantize it and run i=
t on my phone. Let me compress this vision model." If you are that person, =
this role is going to exist specifically for you.
I know a lot of people who are like the Unix tinkerers in the 1990s and 200=
0s and the Linux tinkerers=E2=80=94they just can't stop tinkering and playi=
ng with technology. That's fantastic preparation for this kind of role. We =
are going to want intelligence in everything. If you think we don't, somebo=
dy is going to hire you to implement it anyway. Someone is going to hire yo=
u for the smart refrigerator and the smart toaster and the smart home robot=
 that folds your laundry and the smart washing machine. All of them are goi=
ng to need little large language models that can fit on the device and that=
 need to be secure and that need to run on-premises.
Anyone who can figure out how to deploy intelligence at the edge=E2=80=94if=
 you have the ability to talk about use cases and you're not just intereste=
d in your own technical work=E2=80=94you're going to have steady work.
15. Vector Database and Retrieval Engineers
This field is exploding. No one can get their hands on these people right n=
ow. If you work with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), you are in one o=
f the most valuable places in tech, which is why I've pointed out in the pa=
st that understanding how RAG works is one of those cheat codes right now i=
n the job market. If you are an engineer who works with RAG, you are even m=
ore valuable than you were before. It's absolutely incredible.

The Bottom Line
These four dynamics=E2=80=94automation avalanche, trust deficit, infrastruc=
ture tsunami, and human-AI boundary crisis=E2=80=94aren't abstract trends. =
They're creating specific problems that need specific solutions. People get=
 paid to solve problems.
The question isn't whether AI will affect your job. The question is whether=
 you'll position yourself where the problems are moving, or where they used=
 to be.
97 million new roles may emerge by 2025, creating a net positive of 12 mill=
ion jobs globally. But only for those who understand that AI isn't eliminat=
ing work=E2=80=94it's reshaping where value gets created.
The jobs I've outlined here aren't theoretical. They're being posted right =
now, with real salary ranges, by real companies with real budgets. The oppo=
rtunities are massive.
My goal laying out these roles has been to give you a compass and a map to =
specifici roles. Not just general guideposts. Take this as your starting po=
int and dive in. The world of AI awaits.

Here's what matters: You need to be able to filter all the vibe-coded ideas=

his scenario?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=

fundamentally taking the herd of cats that is a bunch of developers and fig=

ect and create a lot of confusion for users.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We need to und=
erstand that as execution gets faster, UI craft is becoming more valuable b=
ecause the cheap stuff is becoming more commoditized. If you have really po=
lished UI, it's going to stand out more because the sea of the internet is =
going to be filled with vibe-coded stuff that is not well-crafted.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">Let me give you an example that just came out. Perplexity has done =
a really good job with UX interaction design. They just launched the abilit=
y to pass a message to the AI as you read the chain of thought in the middl=
e of a research task. As far as I know, no one else lets you do that yet, a=
nd it's brilliant.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">How many times have you as a user sat th=
ere and typed out a prompt, and then thought, &quot;I forgot to say this&qu=
ot;? You have to add it and then wait for the whole research prompt to run =
again. Not anymore. Now with Perplexity, you just pass the AI a note and it=
 modifies its approach.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That is AI-enabled functionality, b=
ut it's also UX human interaction design. It's solving some of the human-AI=
 boundary issues because you're recognizing the old truth that humans are b=
etter at correcting mistakes we have made than checking our work beforehand=
. That's why good email systems will often give you a delay on send and an =
undo button=E2=80=94they know you instinctively check your work after you s=
end. That's UX design at work.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If you are designing for hum=
an-AI interaction, your world is getting richer with opportunities. If you =
are designing for humans using AI systems, it's the same kind of problem yo=
u've always solved. All of the systems we're using now are getting rapidly =
AI-enabled.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When people say, &quot;Well, I'm not designing =
for AI,&quot; I respond, &quot;But really?&quot; Because almost everything =
is getting AI-ified at a tremendous rate. If it's not true for you now, it =
probably will be because your board is going to ask you to implement it soo=
n. The trend is unbelievably pervasive.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is not a case =
where UX professionals have to go and get AI experience because the AI expe=
rience is largely going to come to you. People are going to be asking you t=
o design these interactions. The challenge for you is to think deeply about=
 human-AI design and figure out how to build trust through interactions.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">I'll give you another example that we haven't solved yet: How=
 do you take the models we have, which are not good at taking accountabilit=
y, and build in interaction dynamics that track accountability over time fo=
r models? If I tell the model, &quot;That is incorrect, do not do that agai=
n,&quot; how can you signpost that and indicate to the user that you have i=
nstructed the LLM in a specific way? Then on the back end, can you work wit=
h AI engineers to pass that as a prompt to remind the LLM, thus improving t=
he experience of even simple chatting because you're actually reinforcing a=
ccountability from the user?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=

ecause these systems produce probabilistic responses, which means you canno=

 QA=E2=80=94sustaining the quality of the software=E2=80=94but you get even=

 very popular. Forward deployed engineers is another term for this type of =
work. Some people say that's different, but it's very similar. This is a ca=

-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The challenge is you also have the quality =
component to consider. It's on you as the forward deployed or solutions eng=
ineer to know what is actually doable from your product technically, and to=

 deliver.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=

's not expensive to code anymore, then you should be able to extend and per=
sonalize the software more, which means more opportunities for sales and so=
lutions engineers, as long as you are careful about quality. I know a lot o=
f solutions engineers who want to advocate for the customer and lean in on =
customization. Just make sure that you know the software stack you're worki=
