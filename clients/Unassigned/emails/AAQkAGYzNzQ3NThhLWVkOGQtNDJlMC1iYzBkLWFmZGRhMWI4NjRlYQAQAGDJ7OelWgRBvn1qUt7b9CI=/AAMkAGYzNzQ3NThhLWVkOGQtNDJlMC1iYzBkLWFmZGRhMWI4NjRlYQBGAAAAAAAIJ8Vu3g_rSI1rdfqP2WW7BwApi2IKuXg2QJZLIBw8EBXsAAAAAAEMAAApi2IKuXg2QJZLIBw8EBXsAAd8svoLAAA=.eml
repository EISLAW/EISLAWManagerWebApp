Welcome, Watcher! This week in LLM Watch, we will learn about LLM agent sys=
tems, reinforcement learning techniques, multimodal models, and theoretical=
 analyses. The highlights include:
A method to diagnose failures in multi-agent LLM systems
Surveys of agentic RL and implicit reasoning in LLMs
A new medical LLM achieving state-of-the-art via interactive training
 Insight into the limits of embedding-based retrieval
And many more! Feel free to check out the glossary below or jump straight t=
o the paper section.
Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
Agentic RL: Using reinforcement learning to make LLMs act - plan, call tool=
s, and adapt - rather than just generate text.
Failure attribution (in agents): Figuring out which step, tool call, or sub=
-agent caused a multi-agent pipeline to fail.
TIR (Tool-Integrated Reasoning): Letting a model iteratively invoke tools (=
code, search, calculators) across multiple turns to solve a problem.
Void turn (SimpleTIR): A step that produces no useful progress (no result, =
no final answer). Filtering these stabilizes RL for multi-turn tool use.
Generative judge (Stepwise judging): A =E2=80=9Ccritic=E2=80=9D model that =
reasons step-by-step with the solver to evaluate each intermediate step, no=
t just the final answer.
Implicit reasoning: Useful internal computation the model performs without =
printing chain-of-thought - faster, cheaper, and sometimes more robust.
Pretraining optimizer: The algorithm (e.g., AdamW, Muon, Soap) that updates=
 weights during large-scale training; real speedups depend on fair tuning a=
t scale.
Embedding-based retrieval: Fetching items by nearest neighbors in a vector =
space, powerful but bounded by the embedding dimension=E2=80=99s expressivi=
ty.
Top-k set (retrieval): The k items an index returns for a query; theory sho=
ws a fixed-dimensional embedding can only realize a limited variety of thes=
e sets.
AgenTracer: Who Is Inducing Failure in the LLM Agentic Systems? (paper [ ht=

AgenTracer introduces a framework to pinpoint which agent or step causes er=
rors in complex multi-agent LLM systems. Such systems (with multiple LLMs, =
tools, and orchestration) are powerful but fragile =E2=80=93 identifying th=
e culprit behind a failure (the failure attribution problem) has been very =
challenging (current LLMs succeed <10% of the time). The authors generate a=
 specialized dataset of failed agent trajectories via counterfactual replay=
s and fault injection, and train AgenTracer-8B (an 8-billion parameter trac=
er model) with reinforcement learning to efficiently diagnose errors in len=
gthy multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B sig=
nificantly outperforms much larger proprietary LLMs (e.g. Gemini-2.5-Pro, C=
laude-4-Sonnet) by up to 18.2% in accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art =
for failure attribution. Moreover, plugging AgenTracer-8B into existing mul=
ti-agent frameworks (like MetaGPT and MaAS) yields 4.8=E2=80=9314.2% perfor=
mance improvements by providing actionable feedback, enabling these agentic=
 systems to better self-correct and evolve.
SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated=
 Reasoning (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/32101287-7b3f-43f2-a681-6=
0478ab74fd0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRM=

)
SimpleTIR proposes a solution to train LLMs to use tools over multiple turn=
s via reinforcement learning without the typical instability and collapse. =
Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) lets an LLM iteratively call ext=
ernal tools (e.g. code execution) to improve reasoning, but prior RL attemp=
ts often diverged due to feedback-induced distribution drift =E2=80=93 the =
model generates low-probability tokens, compounding over turns and blowing =
up gradients. SimpleTIR stabilizes training by filtering out =E2=80=9Cvoid=
=E2=80=9D turns (turns that produce neither a code result nor a final answe=
r). By removing these no-progress trajectories from the RL policy updates, =
it prevents the harmful gradient spikes and keeps learning on track. Experi=
ments on challenging math reasoning tasks show dramatic gains: starting fro=
m a Qwen2.5-7B base, SimpleTIR boosts the AIME24 competition score from 22.=
1 to 50.5, far above a text-only baseline. Notably, because it avoids the c=
onstraints of supervised fine-tuning, the RL-trained model exhibits emergen=
t behaviors like self-correction and cross-validation of its answers, demon=
strating more robust and diverse reasoning patterns.

This survey charts the rapidly evolving field of =E2=80=9CAgentic RL,=E2=80=
=9D where large language models are treated not just as passive text genera=
tors but as autonomous agents that plan, act, and interact in dynamic envir=
onments. The authors formalize the conceptual shift from conventional LLM r=
einforcement learning (which can be seen as a degenerate single-step MDP) t=
o agentic RL framed as a temporally extended, partially observable MDP, bet=
ter capturing the decision-making setting of LLM agents. They propose a two=
-part taxonomy: one dimension categorizes core capabilities needed for agen=
tic behavior (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, perc=
eption), and the other covers applications across diverse task domains. Cen=
tral to their thesis is that reinforcement learning is the critical mechani=
sm to turn these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive,=

Jointly Reinforcing Diversity and Quality in Language Model Generations (pa=

Modern LLM fine-tuning often improves accuracy and helpfulness at the cost =
of diversity =E2=80=93 models become safer and more correct, but also more =
predictable and prone to repetitive answers. This paper tackles that trade-=
off by introducing DARLING (Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning), a fram=
ework to jointly optimize for high-quality and high-diversity outputs. Inst=
ead of naively measuring diversity by lexical differences, DARLING learns a=
 partition function that captures deeper semantic diversity beyond surface-=
level variation. During RL fine-tuning, a reward for this semantic diversit=
y is combined with the quality reward, encouraging the model to explore a b=
roader space of responses. Experiments show that DARLING achieves the best =
of both worlds: on five creative tasks (open-ended instruction following, s=
torytelling, brainstorming), it produces responses that are not only more n=
ovel but also higher quality than those from standard RL fine-tuning. Even =
on verifiable tasks like math problem solving, explicitly optimizing for di=
versity yields higher solution accuracy (pass@1) and a greater variety of c=
orrect solutions (pass@k). Interestingly, the authors note that fostering d=
iversity actually improves quality =E2=80=93 by incentivizing exploration, =
the model uncovers better solutions, illustrating how diversity can catalyz=
e learning in online RL.

This survey examines how large language models can perform reasoning =E2=80=
=9Cunder the hood=E2=80=9D, without externalizing intermediate chain-of-tho=
ught steps. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought explicitly ask=
 the model to generate reasoning steps, implicit reasoning happens silently=
 inside the model=E2=80=99s latent computations, never surfacing as text. S=
uch implicit reasoning is appealing because it can reduce generation cost a=
nd latency, and avoid distractions or inconsistencies in the output. The au=
thors point out that, despite some prior discussions of latent representati=
ons, there hasn=E2=80=99t been a dedicated mechanism-level analysis of how =
LLMs reason internally. This survey fills that gap by proposing a taxonomy =
focused on how and where internal computation unfolds in the model. They cl=
assify implicit reasoning methods into three execution paradigms: (1) laten=
t optimization (the model internally optimizes a hidden objective or plan),=
 (2) signal-guided control (external signals or hints influence hidden stat=
es to guide reasoning), and (3) layer-recurrent execution (iterative reason=
ing steps implemented across layers or through recurrent passes within the =
model). The survey also reviews various structural and behavioral evidence =
that LLMs do carry out implicit reasoning, and it compiles the evaluation m=
etrics and benchmarks used to assess reasoning quality and reliability. A c=
ontinually updated project page of resources is provided for researchers in=
terested in this emerging area.
Baichuan-M2: Scaling Medical Capability with Large Verifier System (paper [=

Baichuan-M2 is a new open-source 32B-parameter medical LLM that closes the =
gap between exam-style benchmark performance and real-world clinical decisi=
on-making. The authors note that existing medical LLMs often excel at stati=
c benchmarks like USMLE exams, yet struggle with the dynamic, interactive n=
ature of actual medical consultations. To bridge this discrepancy, Baichuan=
-M2 is trained within a dynamic verifier framework instead of relying on st=
atic answer checking. This framework consists of two key components: a Pati=
ent Simulator that generates realistic clinical interaction scenarios from =
de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that produc=
es multi-dimensional, context-dependent evaluation metrics on the fly. Toge=
ther they create a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive RL environment fo=
r training the model. Using a multi-stage RL strategy (with a customized Gr=
oup Relative Policy Optimization algorithm), Baichuan-M2 learns to converse=
 and reason like a clinician. The result is a model that sets a new state-o=
f-the-art on the HealthBench suite: Baichuan-M2 not only outperforms all ot=
her open-source medical LLMs, but even surpasses most proprietary models, a=
chieving a score above 32 on the hardest HealthBench subset (a level previo=
usly reached only by GPT-5). This work shows that a robust dynamic verifier=
 system is crucial for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical us=
e, establishing a new Pareto frontier in the performance=E2=80=93model size=
 trade-off for medical AI.
Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them (paper [ https://su=

Despite numerous new optimizers claiming to significantly speed up transfor=
mer training, AdamW remains the de facto standard for LLM pretraining. This=
 study investigates why these =E2=80=9Cfantastic=E2=80=9D optimizers haven=
=E2=80=99t been widely adopted, and conducts a fair, systematic comparison =
of 10 popular deep learning optimizers under controlled settings. The autho=
rs identify two issues that plagued prior comparisons: (i) unequal hyperpar=
ameter tuning =E2=80=93 often new optimizers were compared using suboptimal=
 settings for AdamW or vice-versa, and (ii) misleading evaluation setups =
=E2=80=93 e.g. measuring progress at intermediate checkpoints rather than a=
fter full training. In their experiments across four model scales (from 100=
M to 1.2B params) and varying data sizes, they rigorously tune each optimiz=
er and evaluate at end-of-training. The findings reveal a more nuanced pict=
ure: many optimizers=E2=80=99 actual speedups over a well-tuned AdamW are s=
maller than advertised, and the gain shrinks with model size. For 1.2B-para=
meter models, the fastest optimizers only offer about a 1.1x speedup over A=
damW (far from the 1.4=E2=80=932x sometimes claimed). Moreover, performance=
 rankings can flip during training (due to different learning rate decay be=
haviors), so judging too early can be misleading. Interestingly, the truly =
top-performing optimizers (like Muon and Soap) share a trait: they use matr=
ix-based preconditioning (applying a matrix to adjust gradient updates rath=
er than simple elementwise scaling). These matrix methods do offer faster c=
onvergence for smaller models (e.g. ~1.4x at 100M), but their advantage dim=
inishes as models grow, down to ~1.1x at billion-plus scale. Overall, this =
100+ page study provides a grounded assessment of optimizer performance and=
 emphasizes the importance of fair tuning when seeking real training speedu=
ps.
OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimo=

 ])
OpenVision 2 is a next-generation open-source visual encoder that achieves =
CLIP-like multimodal performance with far less training cost. It simplifies=
 the original OpenVision architecture by removing the text encoder and the =
contrastive loss, using only a single generative objective (image-to-captio=
n) for pretraining. In other words, OpenVision 2 is trained only to caption=
 images (using synthetic and web-crawled captions) and does not explicitly =
learn to align images with separate text embeddings. Despite this drastic s=
implification, the model matches the original OpenVision on a broad suite o=
f vision-language benchmarks. Crucially, it is much more efficient: for a V=
iT-L/14 backbone, OpenVision 2 cuts training time by ~1.5=C3=97 (from 83 ho=
urs to 57 hours) and reduces GPU memory usage by ~1.8=C3=97 (24.5 GB =E2=86=
=92 13.8 GB), which allows using much larger batch sizes (up to 8k images).=
 This improved efficiency enabled the authors to scale up the vision encode=
r to billion-plus parameters, far beyond the largest in the original OpenVi=
sion family. The success of this captioning-only, generative pretraining pa=
radigm suggests a compelling direction for future multimodal foundation mod=
els =E2=80=93 the authors argue that a lightweight generative encoder can a=
chieve strong vision-language performance without the overhead of dual enco=
ders and contrastive training.
On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval (paper [ https:=

This paper delivers a theoretical wake-up call for embedding-based retrieva=
l methods. Vector embeddings are now used to fetch not just relevant docume=
nts, but code snippets, reasoning chains, etc., for virtually any query =E2=
=80=93 raising the question of whether a single fixed-dimensional embedding=
 space can truly handle =E2=80=9Cany notion of relevance=E2=80=9D. Prior wo=
rks had noted certain theoretical limitations (e.g. the curse of dimensiona=
lity or linear separability issues), but many assumed these only manifest o=
n contrived queries and that scaling up models and data would overcome them=
=2E Here, the authors prove that fundam=
ental limits arise even in realistic s=
ettings: specifically, the number of distinct top=E2=80=91k sets a similari=
ty search can produce is bounded by the embedding dimension. In simple term=
s, no matter how good the model is, a $d$-dimensional embedding can only re=
alize a limited variety of retrieval outcomes (top=E2=80=91k document ranki=
ngs) =E2=80=93 a limit that exists even for very basic queries. They demons=
trate this empirically for k=3D2 on a synthetic task by optimally training =
embeddings: even with free rein to learn, a low-dimensional embedding canno=
t distinguish all the needed retrieval cases. To stress-test real models, t=
he authors construct a dataset called LIMIT that embodies these theoretical=
 constraints, yet uses straightforward queries and document relationships. =
On LIMIT, even state-of-the-art embeddings struggle, failing to retrieve th=
e correct items in cases that the theory predicts they should fail. This wo=
rk shows that the single-vector retrieval paradigm has an inherent ceiling =
in what it can represent. It calls for research into new retrieval methods =
(e.g. higher-dimensional, multi-vector, or adaptive approaches) to bypass t=
his fundamental limitation and handle the growing demands on retrieval syst=
ems.
Wrap-Up
If last month was about =E2=80=9Cbigger brains,=E2=80=9D this week is about=
 =E2=80=9Cbetter habits.=E2=80=9D We saw tools to diagnose agent failures, =
RL recipes that make multi-turn tool use finally stable, and judges that ke=
ep chain-of-thought honest. Two surveys (agentic RL and implicit reasoning)=
 that identify what practitioners are already doing in the wild - turning p=
attern matchers into adaptive actors.
On the application side, medicine gets a lift from interactive verifier sys=
tems that reward real clinical reasoning, not just trivia recall. Under the=
 hood, a careful look at pretraining optimizers reminds us that claimed spe=
edups often shrink at scale. Meanwhile, caption-only visual encoders show w=
e can simplify multimodal pretraining and still hit SOTA. And for everyone =
building RAG: theory says single-vector retrieval has ceilings - time to ex=
plore multi-vector and adaptive retrievers.
The bottom line? The next gains won=E2=80=99t come from one trick, they=E2=
=80=99ll come from systems thinking - better critics, steadier training loo=
ps, smarter memory, and retrieval that matches the task. If you=E2=80=99re =
shipping agents, this is your blueprint to make them faster, safer, and mor=

plex multi-agent LLM systems. Such systems (with multiple LLMs, tools, and =
orchestration) are powerful but fragile =E2=80=93 identifying the culprit b=
ehind a failure (the failure attribution problem) has been very challenging=
 (current LLMs succeed &lt;10% of the time). The authors generate a special=
ized dataset of failed agent trajectories via counterfactual replays and fa=
ult injection, and train AgenTracer-8B (an 8-billion parameter tracer model=
) with reinforcement learning to efficiently diagnose errors in lengthy mul=
ti-agent interactions. On the Who&amp;When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B signifi=
cantly outperforms much larger proprietary LLMs (e.g. Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claud=
e-4-Sonnet) by up to 18.2% in accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for =
failure attribution. Moreover, plugging AgenTracer-8B into existing multi-a=
gent frameworks (like MetaGPT and MaAS) yields 4.8=E2=80=9314.2% performanc=
e improvements by providing actionable feedback, enabling these agentic sys=

LLMs to use tools over multiple turns via reinforcement learning without th=
e typical instability and collapse. Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (T=
IR) lets an LLM iteratively call external tools (e.g. code execution) to im=
prove reasoning, but prior RL attempts often diverged due to feedback-induc=
ed distribution drift =E2=80=93 the model generates low-probability tokens,=
 compounding over turns and blowing up gradients. SimpleTIR stabilizes trai=
ning by filtering out =E2=80=9Cvoid=E2=80=9D turns (turns that produce neit=
her a code result nor a final answer). By removing these no-progress trajec=
tories from the RL policy updates, it prevents the harmful gradient spikes =
and keeps learning on track. Experiments on challenging math reasoning task=
s show dramatic gains: starting from a Qwen2.5-7B base, SimpleTIR boosts th=
e AIME24 competition score from 22.1 to 50.5, far above a text-only baselin=
e. Notably, because it avoids the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, th=
e RL-trained model exhibits emergent behaviors like self-correction and cro=
ss-validation of its answers, demonstrating more robust and diverse reasoni=
ng patterns.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: =

evolving field of =E2=80=9CAgentic RL,=E2=80=9D where large language models=
 are treated not just as passive text generators but as autonomous agents t=
hat plan, act, and interact in dynamic environments. The authors formalize =
the conceptual shift from conventional LLM reinforcement learning (which ca=
n be seen as a degenerate single-step MDP) to agentic RL framed as a tempor=
ally extended, partially observable MDP, better capturing the decision-maki=
ng setting of LLM agents. They propose a two-part taxonomy: one dimension c=
ategorizes core capabilities needed for agentic behavior (planning, tool us=
e, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, perception), and the other covers a=
pplications across diverse task domains. Central to their thesis is that re=
inforcement learning is the critical mechanism to turn these capabilities f=
rom static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust behaviors. The survey c=
onsolidates over 500 recent works, along with open-source environments, ben=
chmarks, and frameworks, into a practical compendium. It highlights current=
 opportunities and challenges that will shape progress toward more scalable=
, general-purpose AI agents in the future.</p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px=

dern LLM fine-tuning often improves accuracy and helpfulness at the cost of=
 diversity =E2=80=93 models become safer and more correct, but also more pr=
edictable and prone to repetitive answers. This paper tackles that trade-of=
f by introducing DARLING (Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning), a framew=
ork to jointly optimize for high-quality and high-diversity outputs. Instea=
d of naively measuring diversity by lexical differences, DARLING learns a p=
artition function that captures deeper semantic diversity beyond surface-le=
vel variation. During RL fine-tuning, a reward for this semantic diversity =
is combined with the quality reward, encouraging the model to explore a bro=
ader space of responses. Experiments show that DARLING achieves the best of=
 both worlds: on five creative tasks (open-ended instruction following, sto=
rytelling, brainstorming), it produces responses that are not only more nov=
el but also higher quality than those from standard RL fine-tuning. Even on=
 verifiable tasks like math problem solving, explicitly optimizing for dive=
rsity yields higher solution accuracy (pass@1) and a greater variety of cor=
rect solutions (pass@k). Interestingly, the authors note that fostering div=
ersity actually improves quality =E2=80=93 by incentivizing exploration, th=
e model uncovers better solutions, illustrating how diversity can catalyze =
learning in online RL.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"positio=

e language models can perform reasoning =E2=80=9Cunder the hood=E2=80=9D, w=
ithout externalizing intermediate chain-of-thought steps. While prompting s=
trategies like Chain-of-Thought explicitly ask the model to generate reason=
ing steps, implicit reasoning happens silently inside the model=E2=80=99s l=
atent computations, never surfacing as text. Such implicit reasoning is app=
ealing because it can reduce generation cost and latency, and avoid distrac=
tions or inconsistencies in the output. The authors point out that, despite=
 some prior discussions of latent representations, there hasn=E2=80=99t bee=
n a dedicated mechanism-level analysis of how LLMs reason internally. This =
survey fills that gap by proposing a taxonomy focused on how and where inte=
rnal computation unfolds in the model. They classify implicit reasoning met=
hods into three execution paradigms: (1) latent optimization (the model int=
ernally optimizes a hidden objective or plan), (2) signal-guided control (e=
xternal signals or hints influence hidden states to guide reasoning), and (=
3) layer-recurrent execution (iterative reasoning steps implemented across =
layers or through recurrent passes within the model). The survey also revie=
ws various structural and behavioral evidence that LLMs do carry out implic=
it reasoning, and it compiles the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used to=
 assess reasoning quality and reliability. A continually updated project pa=

ameter medical LLM that closes the gap between exam-style benchmark perform=
ance and real-world clinical decision-making. The authors note that existin=
g medical LLMs often excel at static benchmarks like USMLE exams, yet strug=
gle with the dynamic, interactive nature of actual medical consultations. T=
o bridge this discrepancy, Baichuan-M2 is trained within a dynamic verifier=
 framework instead of relying on static answer checking. This framework con=
sists of two key components: a Patient Simulator that generates realistic c=
linical interaction scenarios from de-identified medical records, and a Cli=
nical Rubrics Generator that produces multi-dimensional, context-dependent =
evaluation metrics on the fly. Together they create a large-scale, high-fid=
elity interactive RL environment for training the model. Using a multi-stag=
e RL strategy (with a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization algorit=
hm), Baichuan-M2 learns to converse and reason like a clinician. The result=
 is a model that sets a new state-of-the-art on the HealthBench suite: Baic=
huan-M2 not only outperforms all other open-source medical LLMs, but even s=
urpasses most proprietary models, achieving a score above 32 on the hardest=
 HealthBench subset (a level previously reached only by GPT-5). This work s=
hows that a robust dynamic verifier system is crucial for aligning LLM capa=
bilities with practical clinical use, establishing a new Pareto frontier in=
 the performance=E2=80=93model size trade-off for medical AI.</span></p><h2=

 up transformer training, AdamW remains the de facto standard for LLM pretr=
aining. This study investigates why these =E2=80=9Cfantastic=E2=80=9D optim=
izers haven=E2=80=99t been widely adopted, and conducts a fair, systematic =
comparison of 10 popular deep learning optimizers under controlled settings=
. The authors identify two issues that plagued prior comparisons: (i) unequ=
al hyperparameter tuning =E2=80=93 often new optimizers were compared using=
 suboptimal settings for AdamW or vice-versa, and (ii) misleading evaluatio=
n setups =E2=80=93 e.g. measuring progress at intermediate checkpoints rath=
er than after full training. In their experiments across four model scales =
(from 100M to 1.2B params) and varying data sizes, they rigorously tune eac=
h optimizer and evaluate at end-of-training. The findings reveal a more nua=
nced picture: many optimizers=E2=80=99 actual speedups over a well-tuned Ad=
amW are smaller than advertised, and the gain shrinks with model size. For =
1.2B-parameter models, the fastest optimizers only offer about a 1.1x speed=
up over AdamW (far from the 1.4=E2=80=932x sometimes claimed). Moreover, pe=
rformance rankings can flip during training (due to different learning rate=
 decay behaviors), so judging too early can be misleading. Interestingly, t=
he truly top-performing optimizers (like Muon and Soap) share a trait: they=
 use matrix-based preconditioning (applying a matrix to adjust gradient upd=
ates rather than simple elementwise scaling). These matrix methods do offer=
 faster convergence for smaller models (e.g. ~1.4x at 100M), but their adva=
ntage diminishes as models grow, down to ~1.1x at billion-plus scale. Overa=
ll, this 100+ page study provides a grounded assessment of optimizer perfor=
mance and emphasizes the importance of fair tuning when seeking real traini=
ng speedups.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relativ=

2</strong><span> is a next-generation open-source visual encoder that achie=
ves CLIP-like multimodal performance with far less training cost. It simpli=
fies the original OpenVision architecture by removing the text encoder and =
the contrastive loss, using only a single generative objective (image-to-ca=
ption) for pretraining. In other words, OpenVision 2 is trained only to cap=
tion images (using synthetic and web-crawled captions) and does not explici=
tly learn to align images with separate text embeddings. Despite this drast=
ic simplification, the model matches the original OpenVision on a broad sui=
te of vision-language benchmarks. Crucially, it is much more efficient: for=
 a ViT-L/14 backbone, OpenVision 2 cuts training time by ~1.5=C3=97 (from 8=
3 hours to 57 hours) and reduces GPU memory usage by ~1.8=C3=97 (24.5 GB =
=E2=86=92 13.8 GB), which allows using much larger batch sizes (up to 8k im=
ages). This improved efficiency enabled the authors to scale up the vision =
encoder to billion-plus parameters, far beyond the largest in the original =
OpenVision family. The success of this captioning-only, generative pretrain=
ing paradigm suggests a compelling direction for future multimodal foundati=
on models =E2=80=93 the authors argue that a lightweight generative encoder=
 can achieve strong vision-language performance without the overhead of dua=
l encoders and contrastive training.</span></p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-p=

ers a theoretical wake-up call for embedding-based retrieval methods. Vecto=
r embeddings are now used to fetch not just relevant documents, but code sn=
ippets, reasoning chains, etc., for virtually any query =E2=80=93 raising t=
he question of whether a single fixed-dimensional embedding space can truly=
 handle =E2=80=9Cany notion of relevance=E2=80=9D. Prior works had noted ce=
rtain theoretical limitations (e.g. the curse of dimensionality or linear s=
eparability issues), but many assumed these only manifest on contrived quer=
ies and that scaling up models and data would overcome them. Here, the auth=
ors prove that fundamental limits arise even in realistic settings: specifi=
cally, the number of distinct top=E2=80=91k sets a similarity search can pr=
oduce is bounded by the embedding dimension. In simple terms, no matter how=
 good the model is, a $d$-dimensional embedding can only realize a limited =
variety of retrieval outcomes (top=E2=80=91k document rankings) =E2=80=93 a=
 limit that exists even for very basic queries. They demonstrate this empir=
ically for k=3D2 on a synthetic task by optimally training embeddings: even=
 with free rein to learn, a low-dimensional embedding cannot distinguish al=
l the needed retrieval cases. To stress-test real models, the authors const=
ruct a dataset called LIMIT that embodies these theoretical constraints, ye=
t uses straightforward queries and document relationships. On LIMIT, even s=
tate-of-the-art embeddings struggle, failing to retrieve the correct items =
in cases that the theory predicts they should fail. This work shows that th=
e single-vector retrieval paradigm has an inherent ceiling in what it can r=
epresent. It calls for research into new retrieval methods (e.g. higher-dim=
ensional, multi-vector, or adaptive approaches) to bypass this fundamental =
limitation and handle the growing demands on retrieval systems.</p><div sty=
