The AI hype cycle has ended. What remains isn=E2=80=99t speculation =E2=80=
=94 it=E2=80=99s execution. In 2025, the difference between breakout winner=
s and stalled experiments comes down to GTM architecture: how fast you can =
wedge into a workflow, how defensible your moats are [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/358c577e-1612-4718-924f-59bcf936dbb4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], and how deeply your product embe=
ds into daily operations. This report distills the patterns shaping the nex=
t wave of durable AI growth.
Two Winning Archetypes in AI GTM
When it comes to AI growth, founders often confuse speed with sustainabilit=
y. The truth is, there are only a couple of repeatable velocity models that=
 consistently scale.
Operator Callout: Not all AI rocket ships follow the same trajectory =E2=80=
=94 your GTM strategy should match your velocity model.
Playbook Tip: For most founders, Shooting Star pacing wins =E2=80=94 fast, =
but with healthy economics and defensibility.
Memory + Context =3D The New Moat
AI-native products that remember and adapt are sticky by design. In SaaS 1.=
0, retention was a function of integrations and customer success. In AI 2.0=
, it=E2=80=99s about whether the product itself remembers, understands, and=
 grows with the customer.
Operator Callout: In 2025, memory is the new integration layer. Products th=
at can carry forward customer context don=E2=80=99t just retain =E2=80=94 t=
hey expand automatically.
Three Levels of AI Memory:
Short-term (session memory): Large context windows allow for coherent, mult=
i-turn sessions =E2=80=94 but without persistence, every new login feels li=
ke amnesia.
Long-term (persistent memory): The product recalls a user=E2=80=99s history=
, preferences, and workflows across sessions. This enables personalization =
that compounds over time.
Semantic (understanding memory): Going beyond storing data, the product act=
ually understands meaning =E2=80=94 surfacing insights, anticipating next s=
teps, and adapting to changes.
Why This Is a Moat:
Switching costs rise the longer a product =E2=80=9Cknows=E2=80=9D a custome=
r=E2=80=99s world. Moving to a competitor means retraining from scratch.
Trust compounds =E2=80=94 when users feel =E2=80=9Cseen=E2=80=9D by the pro=
duct, they stick, even if competitors have cheaper features.
Expansion accelerates =E2=80=94 memory unlocks upsells (=E2=80=9Csince you =
do X, let me help with Y=E2=80=9D) without heavy sales touch.
Playbook Tip: Make retention a product feature, not just a CSM function. If=
 your product knows the customer=E2=80=99s world better than they do, churn=
 becomes unthinkable.
From Systems of Record =E2=86=92 Systems of Action
Traditional SaaS was built as systems of record: places where data was stor=
ed, tagged, and occasionally queried. The new frontier is systems of action=
: platforms that don=E2=80=99t just record activity, but perform it
Operator Callout: The biggest SaaS categories are no longer safe. If your G=
TM strategy relies on =E2=80=9Cintegrating with Salesforce,=E2=80=9D you ma=
y wake up to a world where Salesforce itself is a background database, not =
the workflow hub.
What=E2=80=99s Changing:
Legacy SaaS is exposed =E2=80=94 CRM, ERP, and HRIS tools were built for ma=
nual inputs and dashboards. They rely on people to act.
AI-native challengers act directly on data =E2=80=94 drafting the email, up=
dating the forecast, scheduling the meeting =E2=80=94 without a human movin=
g between tools.
Agentic workflows =3D 10x ROI =E2=80=94 instead of incremental efficiency g=
ains (2=E2=80=935%), you get step-changes (90% of a workflow automated end-=
to-end).
Playbook Tip: Don=E2=80=99t retrofit AI into old workflows. Rebuild so the =
output is the work. The winning AI products won=E2=80=99t ask for inputs =
=E2=80=94 they=E2=80=99ll deliver results.
And just as systems of action redefine workflows, the sharpest AI companies=
 are entering markets through a single wedge that unlocks expansion.
The AI GTM Wedge Play
Every breakout AI company of the past three years has started with a sharp =
wedge =E2=80=94 a painful, frequent, high-value problem that nobody else so=
lved well. The wedge gets you in the door, but it=E2=80=99s only the beginn=
ing. The winners expand sideways into the workflow, and eventually capture =
the category.
Operator Callout: Too many founders pick a wedge that=E2=80=99s interesting=
 to them but not economically sharp enough. If customers don=E2=80=99t feel=
 the pain every day, it=E2=80=99s not a wedge =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s a feat=
ure.
Examples of the Wedge =E2=86=92 Workflow =E2=86=92 Category Path:
Legal demand automation =E2=86=92 case preparation =E2=86=92 full legal OS
Clinical note-taking =E2=86=92 patient record integration =E2=86=92 healthc=
are platform
AI sales notes =E2=86=92 pipeline management =E2=86=92 AI CRM
AI GTM Wedge Map (3 Steps)
Identify a sharp wedge
Look for problems that are expensive, frequent, and high-friction
Validate that customers already pay to solve them, even with duct-taped sol=
utions
Win the workflow
Expand into adjacent tasks so the product becomes indispensable in daily op=
erations
Make switching impossible by owning the full workflow, not just one step
Capture the category
Reframe the narrative from tool =E2=86=92 platform =E2=86=92 operating syst=
em
Build integrations and ecosystem layers to make your wedge the default hub
Playbook Tip: Solve the sharpest pain first. Use that foothold to win the w=
orkflow, then the category.
The Browser Is the New OS
Agentic browsers like Comet and Dia are turning the web into a programmable=
 command center. Instead of being a passive window, the browser is becoming=
 the orchestration layer where AI agents live, act, and collaborate.
Operator Callout: If your AI product requires users to constantly log in, u=
pload data, or juggle integrations, you=E2=80=99re at risk. The browser lay=
er will compress those steps into one.
Why this matters for GTM:
Distribution shifts: In a browser-native world, the entry point isn=E2=80=
=99t your app =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s the AI tab. Whoever owns the =E2=80=9C=
control center=E2=80=9D can mediate user flows across apps, making traditio=
nal SaaS navigation obsolete.
Workflow consolidation: Tabs, extensions, and plug-ins become orchestrated =
tasks. A browser agent can draft the contract in Google Docs, file it in No=
tion, and push it into Salesforce =E2=80=94 all without a human switching c=
ontext.
Identity + memory: Because the browser sits at the intersection of apps, it=
 naturally becomes the keeper of user state and memory. This creates the po=
tential for horizontal moats bigger than single-app verticals.
Playbook Tip: If your AI product lives online, design for browser-native, m=
ulti-step workflows now. Think in terms of flows, not screens. The =E2=80=

=99re not in it, you=E2=80=99re invisible.
Private Evals =3D Enterprise Confidence
Leaderboard scores don=E2=80=99t win enterprise deals =E2=80=94 private pro=
of does.
Enterprise Eval Readiness Checklist:
=E2=98=90 Can your product run on proprietary customer data in a sandboxed =
environment?
=E2=98=90 Do you track latency, accuracy, and hallucination rates in real-t=
ime?
=E2=98=90 Is there a clear audit trail (data lineage, compliance flags)?
=E2=98=90 Can security/legal review your setup in under 30 minutes?
=E2=98=90 Do you provide a simple before/after ROI snapshot?
Operator Callout: Benchmarks don=E2=80=99t close deals. Trust does.
Playbook Tip: Treat evals as a sales motion, not an engineering favor. Ente=
rprise trust is earned through controlled trials, not benchmarks.
Once trust is established through private evals, the question shifts to whe=
re AI delivers the deepest ROI =E2=80=94 and that=E2=80=99s where vertical =
focus comes into play.
Why Vertical AI Is Winning Fast
Industries long dismissed as =E2=80=9Cslow to adopt=E2=80=9D weren=E2=80=99=
t resistant to technology =E2=80=94 they were waiting for tools that could =
handle their real work. Horizontal AI tools struggle with context, complian=
ce, and integration complexity. Vertical AI companies win by embedding deep=
ly into domain workflows.
Where It=E2=80=99s Happening:
Healthcare: Clinical note-taking =E2=86=92 patient record automation =E2=86=
=92 healthcare platform
Legal: Demand automation =E2=86=92 workflows =E2=86=92 legal OS
Education: AI tutoring =E2=86=92 LMS =E2=86=92 personalized education platf=
orms
Operator Callout: Going vertical doesn=E2=80=99t shrink TAM =E2=80=94 it of=
ten expands it. By solving a domain=E2=80=99s hardest problems, you capture=
 not just one workflow but the entire category stack.
Playbook Tip: Deep vertical focus can deliver a bigger TAM than chasing hor=
izontal. Start with a wedge that screams ROI in one industry, then expand u=
p the stack until you own the category.
Incumbents Are Waking Up
The early =E2=80=9CAI tooling=E2=80=9D wave was written off by many incumbe=
nts as hype. That=E2=80=99s over. In 2025, Big SaaS knows the stakes =E2=80=
=94 and they=E2=80=99re responding with their balance sheets.
Where to Expect Activity:
Regulated industries: Healthcare, finance, and legal (credibility + complia=
nce are bought, not built).
Service-heavy verticals: HR, accounting, customer support (continuity and s=
tickiness matter).
Infrastructure layers: Memory, orchestration, evaluation, and agentic brows=
ers (prime M&A targets).
Operator Callout: Big SaaS isn=E2=80=99t standing still =E2=80=94 they=E2=
=80=99re shopping. If your GTM looks like a feature inside Salesforce, Work=
day, or ServiceNow, assume you=E2=80=99ll either compete head-on or be on t=
heir shopping list.
Playbook Tip: Build to own the category, but engineer optionality. Strategi=
c exits in 2025 won=E2=80=99t come from desperation =E2=80=94 they=E2=80=99=
ll come from strength.
The Founder=E2=80=99s Edge in 2025
Speed still matters =E2=80=94 but in 2025, speed with precision is what sep=
arates noise from durable companies.
What Top Founders Are Doing Differently:
Choosing the right wedge =E2=80=94 painful, frequent, expensive
Building moats from day one =E2=80=94 memory, context, data, embedding
Creating must-have workflows =E2=80=94 products customers can=E2=80=99t wor=
k without
Operator Callout: Precision is the edge.
=E2=9A=A1 Operator=E2=80=99s Takeaway
The 2025 GTM frontier isn=E2=80=99t about chasing hype =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=
=99s about velocity with precision. Match your archetype, own your wedge, a=
nd make retention the moat.
