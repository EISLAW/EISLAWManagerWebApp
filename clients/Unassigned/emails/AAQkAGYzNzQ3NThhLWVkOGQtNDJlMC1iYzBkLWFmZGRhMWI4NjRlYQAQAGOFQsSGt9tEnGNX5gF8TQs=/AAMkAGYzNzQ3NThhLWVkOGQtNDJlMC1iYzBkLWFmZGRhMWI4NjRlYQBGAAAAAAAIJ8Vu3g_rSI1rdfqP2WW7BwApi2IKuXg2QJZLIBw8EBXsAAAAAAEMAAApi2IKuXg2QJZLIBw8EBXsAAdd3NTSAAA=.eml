AS SYRIA GOES, SO GOES THE MIDDLE EAST [3]
MANY MAJOR POWERS WANT THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ROOT.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
Situated at the crossroads of more powerful countries, Syria is the fulcrum of a tumultuous region. What happens to the country has important implications for the national security interests of Turkey
and Israel. Turkey needs the new Syrian government to consolidate itself, while Israel sees the government as a threat, led as it is by the country’s largest Islamist group. As for the U.S., it will
be difficult to manage two allies with such markedly different perspectives on Syria.
On July 23, the Turkish Defense Ministry acceded to Syrian requests to provide military support after Israeli airstrikes targeted Syrian government and Islamist militias that had attacked Druze
minority communities in the southern province of Sweida. This came a day after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan – in an oblique reference to Israel – warned that his country would directly
intervene against any attempt to fragment Syria and thwart any attempt by groups seeking autonomy there. Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to Syria (who is also the American ambassador to
Turkey), Tom Barrack, was quoted in an AP report from July 21 as saying, “Strong nation-states are a threat – especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel.” Earlier, a July 20 report
from Axios quoted several unnamed White House officials who expressed serious frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to engage in military action in Syria.
Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s influence in the Levant has had an unintended consequence. The strategic vacuum in Syria has been filled by the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham
– the backbone of the interim government headed by President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Put simply, weakening Iran and its radical Shiite proxies empowers Sunni jihadism and vice versa. There is no immediate
escape for Israel from this cycle.

This is why the Israel Defense Forces established a 91-square-mile (236-square-kilometer) buffer zone beyond the Golan Heights in the southern Syrian province of Quneitra. The stated purpose of this
zone, which stretches from Mount Hermon on the Lebanon-Syria border to the Yarmouk River Valley along Jordan’s border with Syria and Israel, is to protect northern Israel from Islamist factions
allied with the al-Sharaa government. The new HTS regime has said it does not seek conflict with Israel, and the two countries have been engaged in talks mediated by the United States and the United
Arab Emirates, with some discussion facilitated by Azerbaijan. But for Israel, the new government’s intentions and capabilities are still unclear.
Through its own indigenous Druze communities, Israel has close ties to certain factions among the Syrian Druze, who oppose the new government’s efforts to establish its influence in Sweida. Israel
thus intervened when clashes broke out between the Islamist militias and Arab tribes allied with the al-Sharaa government and the separatist Druze factions. The IDF conducted airstrikes targeting
Islamist and Bedouin tribal fighters, Syrian forces en route to Sweida, and the government’s military headquarters in Damascus. This created friction between Israel and Turkey, the principal backer
of the Syrian government.
Despite the souring of ties that began after the 2008-09 Gaza War and the broader Palestinian issue, for years there was no risk of a conflict between Turkey and Israel. Iran’s influence in the
Levant confined Turkey to a limited military presence in northern Syria, where Ankara was focused on containing Kurdish separatism on both sides of the border. Israel’s priority was countering the
threat from Iran and its allies. Until last fall. Israel's decimation of Hezbollah’s leadership and dismantling of its offensive capabilities created a historic opportunity for Turkey and its Syrian
allies to oust the Assad regime.
Turkey wants the new Syrian regime to consolidate power – a process that, barring major disruptions, will take many years. Ankara needs a friendly government in Damascus whose power extends to all
parts of the country, especially the northeast, where Syrian Kurds led by the Syrian Democratic Forces have ruled themselves since 2012. The SDF has been the primary force fighting the Islamic State
group and thus gained even more power, which has amplified Ankara’s threat perception. Therefore, it would like the SDF and the broader Syrian Kurdish movement that it represents to be integrated
into the new Syrian state.
The clashes with the Druze (and before that with the Alawites in northwestern Syria) undermine this goal. From Turkey’s point of view, Israel’s support for the Druze sets a bad precedent for
others to follow. The Druze constitute about 3 percent of the Syrian population, and only certain factions of the community are aligned with Israel. Ankara is more concerned about future Israeli
support for the Kurds, which make up as much as 10 percent of the country’s population and are militarily a more formidable challenge to Damascus.
So even though Turkey and Israel have no interest in a conflict with each other, their respective imperatives diverge. Since April, there have been three rounds of deconfliction talks between the two
sides in Baku, which is a close ally of both countries. But the discussions have yet to address the strategic differences between the Turks and the Israelis. What complicates things further for Israel
is that Washington – not to mention Arab powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE – also wants the al-Sharaa government to succeed.
Turkey and Saudi Arabia are the two pillars of the Trump administration’s strategy for managing the Arab world. The first step in this management is to steer Syria away from conflict and toward
economic development. This much was clear when Trump met with al-Sharaa in Riyadh in the presence of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan attending virtually. For the U.S., adding Israel to this mix will be critical to ensure that Syria does not descend into civil war as Libya and Yemen did. That outcome would have dire
security repercussions for the entire region.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Situated at the cr=
ossroads of more powerful countries, Syria is the fulcrum of a tumultuous r=
egion. What happens to the country has important implications for the natio=
nal security interests of Turkey and Israel. Turkey needs the new Syrian go=
vernment to consolidate itself, while Israel sees the government as a threa=
t, led as it is by the country=E2=80=99s largest Islamist group. As for the=
 U.S., it will be difficult to manage two allies with such markedly differe=
nt perspectives on Syria.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On July 23, the Tu=
rkish Defense Ministry acceded to Syrian requests to provide military suppo=
rt after Israeli airstrikes targeted Syrian government and Islamist militia=
s that had attacked Druze minority communities in the southern province of =
Sweida. This came a day after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan =E2=80=
=93 in an oblique reference to Israel =E2=80=93 warned that his country wou=
ld directly intervene against any attempt to fragment Syria and thwart any =
attempt by groups seeking autonomy there. Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald =
Trump's envoy to Syria (who is also the American ambassador to Turkey), Tom=
 Barrack, was quoted in an AP report from July 21 as saying, =E2=80=9CStron=
g nation-states are a threat =E2=80=93 especially Arab states are viewed as=
 a threat to Israel.=E2=80=9D Earlier, a July 20 report from Axios quoted s=
everal unnamed White House officials who expressed serious frustration with=
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu=E2=80=99s decision to engage in =
military action in Syria.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s s=
uccess in rolling back Iran=E2=80=99s influence in the Levant has had an un=
intended consequence. The strategic vacuum in Syria has been filled by the =
Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham =E2=80=93 the backbone of the int=
erim government headed by President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Put simply, weakening =
Iran and its radical Shiite proxies empowers Sunni jihadism and vice versa.=
 There is no immediate escape for Israel from this cycle.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This is why the Is=
rael Defense Forces established a 91-square-mile (236-square-kilometer) buf=
fer zone beyond the Golan Heights in the southern Syrian province of Quneit=
ra. The stated purpose of this zone, which stretches from Mount Hermon on t=
he Lebanon-Syria border to the Yarmouk River Valley along Jordan=E2=80=99s =
border with Syria and Israel, is to protect northern Israel from Islamist f=
actions allied with the al-Sharaa government. The new HTS regime has said i=
t does not seek conflict with Israel, and the two countries have been engag=
ed in talks mediated by the United States and the United Arab Emirates, wit=
h some discussion facilitated by Azerbaijan. But for Israel, the new govern=
ment=E2=80=99s intentions and capabilities are still unclear.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Through its own in=
digenous Druze communities, Israel has close ties to certain factions among=
 the Syrian Druze, who oppose the new government=E2=80=99s efforts to estab=
lish its influence in Sweida. Israel thus intervened when clashes broke out=
 between the Islamist militias and Arab tribes allied with the al-Sharaa go=
vernment and the separatist Druze factions. The IDF conducted airstrikes ta=
rgeting Islamist and Bedouin tribal fighters, Syrian forces en route to Swe=
ida, and the government=E2=80=99s military headquarters in Damascus. This c=
reated friction between Israel and Turkey, the principal backer of the Syri=
an government.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite the sourin=
g of ties that began after the 2008-09 Gaza War and the broader Palestinian=
 issue, for years there was no risk of a conflict between Turkey and Israel=
. Iran=E2=80=99s influence in the Levant confined Turkey to a limited milit=
ary presence in northern Syria, where Ankara was focused on containing Kurd=
ish separatism on both sides of the border. Israel=E2=80=99s priority was c=
ountering the threat from Iran and its allies. Until last fall. Israel's de=
cimation of Hezbollah=E2=80=99s leadership and dismantling of its offensive=
 capabilities created a historic opportunity for Turkey and its Syrian alli=
es to oust the Assad regime.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Turkey wants the n=
ew Syrian regime to consolidate power =E2=80=93 a process that, barring maj=
or disruptions, will take many years. Ankara needs a friendly government in=
 Damascus whose power extends to all parts of the country, especially the n=
ortheast, where Syrian Kurds led by the Syrian Democratic Forces have ruled=
 themselves since 2012. The SDF has been the primary force fighting the Isl=
amic State group and thus gained even more power, which has amplified Ankar=
a=E2=80=99s threat perception. Therefore, it would like the SDF and the bro=
ader Syrian Kurdish movement that it represents to be integrated into the n=
ew Syrian state.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The clashes with t=
he Druze (and before that with the Alawites in northwestern Syria) undermin=
e this goal. From Turkey=E2=80=99s point of view, Israel=E2=80=99s support =
for the Druze sets a bad precedent for others to follow. The Druze constitu=
te about 3 percent of the Syrian population, and only certain factions of t=
he community are aligned with Israel. Ankara is more concerned about future=
 Israeli support for the Kurds, which make up as much as 10 percent of the =
country=E2=80=99s population and are militarily a more formidable challenge=
 to Damascus.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">So even though Tur=
key and Israel have no interest in a conflict with each other, their respec=
tive imperatives diverge. Since April, there have been three rounds of deco=
nfliction talks between the two sides in Baku, which is a close ally of bot=
h countries. But the discussions have yet to address the strategic differen=
ces between the Turks and the Israelis. What complicates things further for=
 Israel is that Washington =E2=80=93 not to mention Arab powers like Saudi =
Arabia and the UAE =E2=80=93 also wants the al-Sharaa government to succeed=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Turkey and Saudi A=
rabia are the two pillars of the Trump administration=E2=80=99s strategy fo=
r managing the Arab world. The first step in this management is to steer Sy=
ria away from conflict and toward economic development. This much was clear=
 when Trump met with al-Sharaa in Riyadh in the presence of Saudi Arabia's =
de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Turkish President Re=
cep Tayyip Erdogan attending virtually. For the U.S., adding Israel to this=
 mix will be critical to ensure that Syria does not descend into civil war =
as Libya and Yemen did. That outcome would have dire security repercussions=
 for the entire region.</p>
