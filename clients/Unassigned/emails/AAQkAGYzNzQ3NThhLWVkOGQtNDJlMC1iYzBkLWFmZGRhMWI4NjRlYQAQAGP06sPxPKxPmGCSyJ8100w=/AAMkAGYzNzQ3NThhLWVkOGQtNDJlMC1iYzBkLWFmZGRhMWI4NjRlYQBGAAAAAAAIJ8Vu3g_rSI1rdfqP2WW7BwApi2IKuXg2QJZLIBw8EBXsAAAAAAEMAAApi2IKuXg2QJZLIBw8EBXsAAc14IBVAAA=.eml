PAKISTAN'S CRUCIAL ROLE IN CHINA'S MILITARY STRATEGY [3]
FOR BEIJING, WARGAMES AND PROXY BATTLES ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR REAL-WORLD COMBAT.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
Had India not conducted unprecedented airstrikes in Pakistan [4] on May 7 – retaliation for a terrorist attack in Kashmir two weeks earlier – Chinese-made air systems would have remained untested.
The downing of Indian jets by Pakistani forces using Chinese-made warplanes and missiles highlighted the advancement of Beijing’s military technology, though primarily in terms of hardware. The
early loss of Indian jets during the 100 hours of fighting revealed more about the human capability – or "humanware" – of Pakistan’s military, which successfully integrated Chinese platforms
into its command-and-control structures and processes. This suggests that China, which lacks Pakistan’s combat experience, does not necessarily pose a greater threat than previously thought in the
Western Pacific.
Over the past few weeks, prominent Western outlets, including Bloomberg, AFP, BBC and The New York Times, have reported on how the four-day India-Pakistan war showcased the increasing lethality of
Chinese jets and missiles against Western aircraft. The downing of three French Rafale fighters – and possibly a Russian MiG-29 and a Sukhoi-30 – by Chinese J-10C aircraft armed with PL-15E
long-range air-to-air missiles gave Beijing a rare chance to test its aerospace industry in real combat conditions. The incident demonstrated that after years of research and billions of dollars in
investment, China is becoming increasingly competitive in aviation and avionics.
These developments are now reshaping perceptions of China’s military as it projects power across the Pacific. Buoyed by Chinese state-backed information operations, media coverage has begun
exploring what the India-Pakistan air battles reveal about China’s ability to take Taiwan. The performance of the Chinese-made jets and missiles coincides with a rise in Chinese wargames [5] along
the coast since late 2021. In addition to recent encirclement drills around Taiwan [6], the Chinese navy has expanded its exercises as far north as the Aleutian Islands, near Alaska, and as far south
as the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.

This scale of wargaming is a relatively recent development for the People’s Liberation Army. It will take time for Chinese forces to conduct sophisticated exercises and master operational
tradecraft. More important, Beijing understands that despite the value of these increasingly complex drills, they cannot substitute for real-world combat. Simulations can mimic battlespace
environments, but they cannot replicate the unpredictability of actual kinetic engagements – especially against the United States.
China has also been closely observing Russia’s underwhelming performance in Ukraine. This is despite Russia being the world's second most powerful military force, with a robust defense industrial
base and centuries of experience in projecting power beyond its borders. The Russia-Ukraine war has likely prompted Beijing to reassess its strategic planning. Unlike Russia, China has not deployed
multidivisional forces beyond its borders since the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan and Mongolia in the late 17th century.
More recently, the People’s Republic of China has fought limited wars with India (1962), the Soviet Union (1969) and Vietnam (1979), all confined to its land borders. Its focus on economic and
technological growth has created a gap between its development of advanced military hardware and its actual combat experience. Moreover, China’s weapons remain largely untested because of this
absence of real warfare, and few nations operate Chinese weapon systems.
Among those that do, Pakistan is unique. It is China’s largest arms buyer, accounting for 63 percent of Chinese weapons exports from 2020 to 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. (During the same period, 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports came from China.) Pakistan is also the most powerful military among major Chinese arms recipients, and unlike
others, it has a sophisticated weapons development program of its own.
This makes the Pakistan-China defense partnership especially significant, despite the many issues that Beijing has with Islamabad [9]. The Chengdu Aircraft Corp., which makes the J-10C, jointly
developed the fifth-generation JF-17 with Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. While many JF-17 components are manufactured by PAC, Pakistan’s key contribution is the integration of avionics, engines,
airframes and weapons. This systems integration capability – combined with decades of experience fighting the much more powerful Indian military and the need for constant innovation – has helped
Pakistan develop the human expertise that China lacks.

Chinese support greatly enhanced Pakistan’s training, tactics and ability to integrate different systems using sophisticated operational protocols. (India also alleges that this collaboration
extended beyond hardware to include satellite support.) But other nations using Chinese equipment have reported problems in the past. In 2022, Myanmar grounded its fleet of Chinese fighter jets due to
structural and technical issues. In 2024, Bangladesh raised quality concerns about Chinese arms. Even Pakistan’s navy has faced challenges with the F-22P frigates, which it operates below full
capacity.
It is also worth noting that the assessment of Chinese systems is based on a single event: Pakistan’s defensive response to Indian airstrikes on May 7. While the shootdowns highlighted the strengths
of Chinese missiles and the J-10C, more engagements might have exposed weaknesses. Regardless, China views the Pakistani air force as a crucial partner for testing its weapons and shaping global
perceptions of its military strength. The India-Pakistan conflict serves as a testing ground, letting China achieve strategic objectives without the costs of direct conflict.

Although China also faces a prolonged border standoff with India [14], using that theater to demonstrate its military capabilities would be far costlier, with repercussions extending into economic
areas. Thus, China is likely to continue leveraging Pakistan as a proxy to counter growing U.S.-India alignment. An India militarily distracted by Pakistan cannot effectively assist the U.S. [15] in
curbing Chinese manufacturing dominance.
Even so, China must manage this proxy strategy carefully to avoid uncontrollable escalation between the two South Asian nuclear powers. Moving forward, Beijing will have to consider how Washington and
New Delhi respond to this evolving dynamic [16]. Just because the J-10C proved effective for Pakistan does not mean it will perform as well for China in a potential confrontation over Taiwan. Chinese
military personnel do not match Pakistan's experience, and their potential adversary in the Pacific is not India – it is the United States.

nes and missiles highlighted the advancement of Beijing=E2=80=99s military =
technology, though primarily in terms of hardware. The early loss of Indian=

kistan=E2=80=99s combat experience, does not necessarily pose a greater thr=
eat than previously thought in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Over the past few =
weeks, prominent Western outlets, including Bloomberg, AFP, BBC and The New=
 York Times, have reported on how the four-day India-Pakistan war showcased=
 the increasing lethality of Chinese jets and missiles against Western airc=
raft. The downing of three French Rafale fighters =E2=80=93 and possibly a =
Russian MiG-29 and a Sukhoi-30 =E2=80=93 by Chinese J-10C aircraft armed wi=
th PL-15E long-range air-to-air missiles gave Beijing a rare chance to test=
 its aerospace industry in real combat conditions. The incident demonstrate=
d that after years of research and billions of dollars in investment, China=
 is becoming increasingly competitive in aviation and avionics.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These developments=
 are now reshaping perceptions of China=E2=80=99s military as it projects p=
ower across the Pacific. Buoyed by Chinese state-backed information operati=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This scale of warg=
aming is a relatively recent development for the People=E2=80=99s Liberatio=
n Army. It will take time for Chinese forces to conduct sophisticated exerc=
ises and master operational tradecraft. More important, Beijing understands=
 that despite the value of these increasingly complex drills, they cannot s=
ubstitute for real-world combat. Simulations can mimic battlespace environm=
ents, but they cannot replicate the unpredictability of actual kinetic enga=
gements =E2=80=93 especially against the United States.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">China has also bee=
n closely observing Russia=E2=80=99s underwhelming performance in Ukraine. =
This is despite Russia being the world's second most powerful military forc=
e, with a robust defense industrial base and centuries of experience in pro=
jecting power beyond its borders. The Russia-Ukraine war has likely prompte=
d Beijing to reassess its strategic planning. Unlike Russia, China has not =
deployed multidivisional forces beyond its borders since the Qing dynasty c=
onquered Taiwan and Mongolia in the late 17th century.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">More recently, the=
 People=E2=80=99s Republic of China has fought limited wars with India (196=
2), the Soviet Union (1969) and Vietnam (1979), all confined to its land bo=
rders. Its focus on economic and technological growth has created a gap bet=
ween its development of advanced military hardware and its actual combat ex=
perience. Moreover, China=E2=80=99s weapons remain largely untested because=
 of this absence of real warfare, and few nations operate Chinese weapon sy=
stems.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Among those that d=
o, Pakistan is unique. It is China=E2=80=99s largest arms buyer, accounting=
 for 63 percent of Chinese weapons exports from 2020 to 2024, according to =
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (During the same peri=
od, 81 percent of Pakistan=E2=80=99s arms imports came from China.) Pakista=
n is also the most powerful military among major Chinese arms recipients, a=
nd unlike others, it has a sophisticated weapons development program of its=
 own.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This makes the Pak=
istan-China defense partnership especially significant, despite the <a href=

ny issues that Beijing has with Islamabad</a>. The Chengdu Aircraft Corp., =
which makes the J-10C, jointly developed the fifth-generation JF-17 with Pa=
kistan Aeronautical Complex. While many JF-17 components are manufactured b=
y PAC, Pakistan=E2=80=99s key contribution is the integration of avionics, =
engines, airframes and weapons. This systems integration capability =E2=80=
=93 combined with decades of experience fighting the much more powerful Ind=
ian military and the need for constant innovation =E2=80=93 has helped Paki=
stan develop the human expertise that China lacks.</p>

eatly enhanced Pakistan=E2=80=99s training, tactics and ability to integrat=
e different systems using sophisticated operational protocols. (India also =
alleges that this collaboration extended beyond hardware to include satelli=
te support.) But other nations using Chinese equipment have reported proble=
ms in the past. In 2022, Myanmar grounded its fleet of Chinese fighter jets=
 due to structural and technical issues. In 2024, Bangladesh raised quality=
 concerns about Chinese arms. Even Pakistan=E2=80=99s navy has faced challe=
nges with the F-22P frigates, which it operates below full capacity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It is also worth n=
oting that the assessment of Chinese systems is based on a single event: Pa=
kistan=E2=80=99s defensive response to Indian airstrikes on May 7. While th=
e shootdowns highlighted the strengths of Chinese missiles and the J-10C, m=
ore engagements might have exposed weaknesses. Regardless, China views the =
Pakistani air force as a crucial partner for testing its weapons and shapin=
g global perceptions of its military strength. The India-Pakistan conflict =
serves as a testing ground, letting China achieve strategic objectives with=
out the costs of direct conflict.</p>
