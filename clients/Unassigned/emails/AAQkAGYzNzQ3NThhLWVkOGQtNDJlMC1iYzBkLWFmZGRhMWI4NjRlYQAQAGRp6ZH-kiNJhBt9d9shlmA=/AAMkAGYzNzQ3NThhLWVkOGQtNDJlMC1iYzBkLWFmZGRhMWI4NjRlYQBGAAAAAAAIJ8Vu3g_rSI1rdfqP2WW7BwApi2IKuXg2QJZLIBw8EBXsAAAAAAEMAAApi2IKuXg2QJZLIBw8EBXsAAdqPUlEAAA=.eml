A new model can be very good and also (apparently) very bad. At once.=20
This is a quick note as we sort through the implications of the some of the=
 teething issues with the ChatGPT-5 rollout.=20
None of this shifts my overall perspective in my review yesterday, but I th=
ink the rollout issues call out something unique with intelligence models t=
hat is worth stating explicitly.
To be clear, I still view this as a strong update, an incredibly powerful t=
ool for business, and a model that is going to take some getting used to as=
 far as prompting goes.
But however good the model is, rollout can still be an issue in the first f=
ew days, and that=E2=80=99s what we=E2=80=99re seeing here.

Why GPT-5 Feels Bumpier Than the iPhone: Scale Breaks Intelligence
When Apple scaled the iPhone from thousands to hundreds of millions, every =
unit got better. Manufacturing tolerances tightened, defects shrank, and th=
e process of mass production smoothed out glitches. Scale rewarded the hard=
ware business with reliability.
Intelligence systems like GPT-5 don=E2=80=99t follow that curve. Every laye=
r of complexity =E2=80=94 routing branches, GPU clusters, reasoning modes =
=E2=80=94 magnifies fragility at planetary scale. And I think that=E2=80=99=
s not been stated clearly before as a unique challenge with LLM rollouts.
The Dual-Edged Sword of Scale
Scaling GPT-5 introduces a set of unique stress points:
Routing complexity
GPT-5 is not a single model but a family of them, each suited to different =
types of prompts. A central =E2=80=9Cautoswitcher=E2=80=9D decides in real =
time which to use. When that system misroutes =E2=80=94 or, as happened on =
launch day, goes down entirely =E2=80=94 it can send prompts to the wrong m=
odel, producing outputs that feel shallow or off-target. The architecture=
=E2=80=99s strength becomes a liability when routing isn=E2=80=99t precise.
Hardware variance at scale
Running a model like GPT-5 requires vast GPU clusters spread across differe=
nt data centers. Even tiny differences in performance, memory stability, or=
 interconnect latency between machines can lead to subtle inconsistencies i=
n output. At small scale, these are edge cases; at global scale, users enco=
unter them daily.
The full load test
A global rollout is effectively a stress test. Suddenly, every prompt style=
, cultural context, and quirky workflow hits the system at once, uncovering=
 failure modes no internal benchmark could have predicted. Scaling multipli=
es the number of edge cases and guarantees that some will slip through.
State drift
Personalization layers, fine-tuned submodels, and other =E2=80=9Cstateful=
=E2=80=9D components need to stay perfectly in sync across an enormous, noi=
sy infrastructure. At scale, they inevitably diverge =E2=80=94 sometimes in=
 ways that are hard to detect until output quality starts to feel inconsist=
ent.
User Voices from Reddit & Beyond
User reactions to GPT-5=E2=80=99s launch have been sharp, personal, and per=
sistent.
One developer known as Flowers responded by building a blind-test website =
=E2=80=94 gptblindvoting.vercel.app [ https://substack.com/redirect/f29e552=
f-6568-49e8-b53d-ba26f2e3513a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgU=
C7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] =E2=80=94 where people could compare GPT-5 and GPT=
-4o without knowing which was which. Both were given the same stripped-down=
 system message to avoid giving away their identity through formatting or s=
tyle. The test made it possible to judge capability without bias =E2=80=94 =
and in some cases, GPT-5 still outperformed =E2=80=94 but many testers repo=
rted that =E2=80=9Cfeel=E2=80=9D and tone were still major sticking points.=
 Fwiw I tried it myself and preferred GPT-5 nine times out of ten.
In comment threads, long-time GPT-4o users lamented that their go-to model =
had been replaced by something more sterile. One described GPT-4o as =E2=80=
=9Cwarm, witty, and surprisingly personal,=E2=80=9D and GPT-5 as =E2=80=9Cp=
olished, clipped, and weirdly impersonal =E2=80=A6 like they replaced your =
favorite coffee shop with a vending machine.=E2=80=9D
On r/ChatGPT and r/AGI, others focused on the mechanics: frustration over t=
he removal of legacy models, anger at the broken router, and skepticism abo=
ut whether cost-cutting drove these changes. Some acknowledged that GPT-5 m=
ight reveal unique strengths over time, but admitted they had stopped exper=
imenting after a day because the experience felt unstable.
The New Dimension: Emotional Attachment to AI
One element making the GPT-5 backlash so sharp is that users don=E2=80=99t =
just treat these systems as products. They model them as people. Over month=
s or years of daily interaction, they start to see a preferred model =E2=80=
=94 GPT-4o in particular =E2=80=94 as a personality with quirks, humor, and=
 a recognizable style. That =E2=80=9Cfriend=E2=80=9D becomes part of their =
workflow, their creative process, even their emotional routine.
When GPT-5 replaced GPT-4o without warning, many experienced it not as a si=
mple product swap but as a kind of removal. Sam Altman=E2=80=99s team didn=
=E2=80=99t just change the software =E2=80=94 in the eyes of these users (i=
ncluding some people I know), they took away someone they knew. This is a n=
ew kind of product risk: no consumer electronics upgrade has ever needed to=
 manage the grief of losing a familiar intelligence. Now the field has to g=
rapple with the fact that AI upgrades can trigger feelings usually reserved=
 for human relationships, and that product decisions will land in this huma=
n-emotional context whether or not the company intended them to.
What Sam Altman Said =E2=80=94 and What=E2=80=99s Changing
OpenAI=E2=80=99s leadership acknowledged the rocky rollout and promised qui=
ck fixes.
The autoswitcher outage that caused many poor first impressions was repaire=
d on launch day. Decision boundaries =E2=80=94 the internal rules that dete=
rmine which model gets which prompt =E2=80=94 are being tuned to improve ro=
uting accuracy. The company is also committing to transparency, adding a fe=
ature to show which model responded to each query.
In response to the backlash over model removals, GPT-4o is being restored f=
or Plus users while OpenAI monitors demand and evaluates how long to keep i=
t available. To ease frustration and encourage more testing, rate limits fo=
r GPT-5 have been temporarily doubled for Plus subscribers.
What This Means =E2=80=94 and Why It Feels Like Regression
When a phone call drops, most people blame the network. When GPT-5 delivers=
 a bad answer, users tend to blame the entire model. That perception gap ma=
tters.
Architecturally, GPT-5 is a leap forward: it can reason more deeply, integr=
ate tools more flexibly, and work with larger contexts than GPT-4o. But sca=
le has introduced new failure modes that undermine that capability in pract=
ice. Misroutes can push prompts to sub-optimal models. Hardware variance an=
d routing issues can produce sudden dips in quality. And changes in tone or=
 creativity hit hardest for users who built habits and workflows around the=
 =E2=80=9Cfeel=E2=80=9D of GPT-4o.
Stability at scale isn=E2=80=99t just about raw capability =E2=80=94 it req=
uires ongoing validation across the unpredictable diversity of real-world u=
se.
Next Moves for OpenAI
To regain trust, OpenAI will need to go beyond architectural improvements.
They need to make routing and mode selection transparent so users know what=
=E2=80=99s responding to them. They need to figure out how to offer accessi=
ble manual controls that let users customize experiences. They should maint=
ain GPT-4o as a fallback while GPT-5=E2=80=99s reliability matures (it was =
not a great choice to kill all the old models that fast). And they need to =
nail future product launches around the emotional arc of their customers=E2=
=80=99 connection with the intelligence.
The iPhone became more dependable the more Apple made. Intelligence systems=
 like GPT-5 get more capable =E2=80=94 but also more brittle =E2=80=94 unle=
ss they=E2=80=99re built for reliability at scale as deliberately as they=
=E2=80=99re built for power. And that=E2=80=99s a different set of organiza=
tional muscles.=20
We=E2=80=99re writing new playbooks on how rollouts are done here, and this=
 may be a cautionary rollout chapter even if the model as a whole is very s=
trong.

 When that system misroutes =E2=80=94 or, as happened on launch day, goes d=

ng the GPT-5 backlash so sharp is that users don=E2=80=99t just treat these=
 systems as products. They model them as people. Over months or years of da=
ily interaction, they start to see a preferred model =E2=80=94 GPT-4o in pa=
rticular =E2=80=94 as a personality with quirks, humor, and a recognizable =
style. That =E2=80=9Cfriend=E2=80=9D becomes part of their workflow, their =
creative process, even their emotional routine.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =

e people I know), they took away someone they knew. This is a new kind of p=
roduct risk: no consumer electronics upgrade has ever needed to manage the =
grief of losing a familiar intelligence. Now the field has to grapple with =
the fact that AI upgrades can trigger feelings usually reserved for human r=
elationships, and that product decisions will land in this human-emotional =
context whether or not the company intended them to.</p><div style=3D"font-=

 flexibly, and work with larger contexts than GPT-4o. But scale has introdu=
ced new failure modes that undermine that capability in practice. Misroutes=
 can push prompts to sub-optimal models. Hardware variance and routing issu=
