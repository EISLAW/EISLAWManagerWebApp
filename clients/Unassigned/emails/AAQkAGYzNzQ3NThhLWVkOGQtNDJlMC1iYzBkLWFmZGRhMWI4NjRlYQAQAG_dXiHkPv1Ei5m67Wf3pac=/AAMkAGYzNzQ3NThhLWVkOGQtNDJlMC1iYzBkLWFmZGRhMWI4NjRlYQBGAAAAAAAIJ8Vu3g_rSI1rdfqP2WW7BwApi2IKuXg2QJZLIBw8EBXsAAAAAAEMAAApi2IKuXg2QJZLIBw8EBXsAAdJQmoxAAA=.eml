1. ALE-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Objective-Driven Algorithm Engin=
eering
Watching: ALE-Bench (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f54b4a9-41b0-45=
db-8faf-8c48d707dbc0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6R=

What problem does it solve? Current LLM benchmarks for competitive programm=
ing focus on short-duration, pass/fail problems with exact solutions. Howev=
er, real-world algorithm engineering often involves NP-hard optimization pr=
oblems where finding the true optimum is computationally infeasible.  ALE-B=
ench is a new benchmark based on AtCoder Heuristic Contests, where particip=
ants spend weeks iteratively refining solutions to maximize scores rather t=
han achieving binary correctness. This tests AI systems' ability for long-h=
orizon reasoning and continuous improvement, essential for industrial optim=
ization tasks like routing and scheduling.
How does it solve the problem? The authors developed ALE-Agent, which combi=
nes two key methods. Method 1 injects domain knowledge directly into prompt=
s, providing guidance on standard algorithm engineering techniques like sim=
ulated annealing and beam search, including search space design and acceler=
ation tricks. Method 2 employs diversity-oriented search using best-first s=
earch with a beam width of 30, generating multiple child nodes simultaneous=
ly to avoid local optima. This approach generated approximately 1000 soluti=
on codes compared to ~100 for standard iterative refinement, with paralleli=
zed candidate generation to manage API latency effectively.
What are the key findings? ALE-Agent dramatically outperformed other soluti=
ons, achieving an average performance of 1879 (top 6.8%) compared to sequen=
tial refinement approaches like o4-mini-high (1411), Gemini 2.5 Pro (1198),=
 and GPT-4.1 mini (1016). The performance distribution showed remarkable co=
nsistency with 100% of problems achieving =E2=89=A5400 performance and 70% =
achieving =E2=89=A51600 performance. Its greatest achievement was scoring 2=
880 on problem AHC039, placing 5th in the original human contest.
Why does it matter? These results demonstrate that sophisticated scaffoldin=
g can elevate AI performance from novice/intermediate levels to compete wit=
h human experts in algorithm engineering. The synergistic effect of combini=
ng domain knowledge with extensive search (61.1% improvement from base) sho=
ws that the right architectural choices matter more than raw model capabili=
ty alone. This has immediate practical implications for deploying AI in ind=
ustrial optimization domains like package delivery, crew scheduling, and po=
wer-grid balancing, where even small improvements can yield significant rea=
l-world impact.

2. From Bytes to Ideas: Language Modeling with Autoregressive U-Nets

What problem does it solve? Language models typically rely on tokenization =
schemes like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) that chop text into fixed vocabulary =
units before training even begins. This creates a rigid system where models=
 are locked into a specific granularity - they can't access individual char=
acters when needed for tasks like spelling, yet they're forced to process c=
ommon words as multiple tokens. The tokenizer becomes a bottleneck: models =
struggle with rare languages not well-represented in the vocabulary, fail a=
t character-level reasoning, and require massive embedding tables that map =
each token ID to a vector while obscuring obvious relationships (like "stra=
wberry" and "strawberries" sharing most letters).
How does it solve the problem? AU-Net (Autoregressive U-Net) processes raw =
bytes directly and learns its own hierarchical tokenization during training=
=2E The architecture uses a U-Net desig=
n with contracting and expanding paths=
: Stage 1 processes individual bytes, Stage 2 pools at word boundaries, Sta=
ge 3 at word pairs, and Stage 4 at four-word chunks. Instead of using looku=
p tables, AU-Net employs attention mechanisms to create contextualized embe=
ddings at each level. The key innovation is that deeper stages naturally pr=
edict further into the future - while Stage 1 predicts the next byte, Stage=
 4 effectively predicts the next four words, creating an implicit multi-sca=
le prediction objective without auxiliary losses.
What are the key findings? When evaluated under identical compute budgets, =
AU-Net matches or exceeds strong BPE baselines across multiple benchmarks, =
with deeper hierarchies (2-3 stages) showing particularly promising scaling=
 trends. The architecture excels at character-level manipulation tasks on t=
he CUTE benchmark and demonstrates superior cross-lingual generalization on=
 FLORES-200, especially for low-resource languages that share orthographic =
patterns with better-represented languages. For instance, on a 1B parameter=
 model trained on 370B tokens, AU-Net-3 achieves 72.9% on HellaSwag compare=
d to 70.2% for the BPE baseline, while AU-Net-4 reaches 31.7% on MMLU versu=
s 27.0% for BPE.
Why does it matter? This challenges the assumption that tokenization must b=
e a separate preprocessing step, showing that models can learn their own ad=
aptive representations while maintaining competitive performance. By operat=
ing on raw bytes, AU-Net eliminates vocabulary constraints, enabling better=
 handling of morphologically rich languages, code switching, and character-=
level reasoning - all without sacrificing the efficiency benefits of hierar=
chical processing. The approach is particularly valuable for multilingual a=
pplications and low-resource languages, where traditional tokenizers often =
fail. More broadly, it suggests that many "fixed" components of the LLM pip=
eline might benefit from being learned end-to-end, opening new avenues for =
more flexible and capable language models.

 of the most widely deployed categories of LLM-based agents, capable of aut=
onomously orchestrating web exploration, retrieval, and synthesis to transf=
orm hours of manual desk research into minutes. However, evaluating these a=
gents comprehensively remains a major challenge. Current benchmarks focus o=
n isolated capabilities like web browsing or text generation, but fail to a=
ssess the end-to-end performance of agents conducting actual deep research.=
 Moreover, evaluating the quality of lengthy research reports is inherently=
 subjective - there's no clear "ground truth" for complex research queries,=
 and the agents' internal reasoning processes remain opaque.
How does it solve the problem? DeepResearchBench was built by first analyzi=
ng 96,147 real user queries to understand actual research needs, ultimately=
 identifying 44,019 that qualified as deep research tasks. They recruited P=
hD-level experts across 22 domains to craft 100 high-quality benchmark task=
s that reflect this real-world distribution. To evaluate DRAs, they develop=
ed two novel frameworks: RACE dynamically generates task-specific evaluatio=
n criteria and weights, then uses reference-based scoring to compare report=
s - essentially asking "how does this report compare to a high-quality refe=
rence?" rather than scoring in isolation. FACT extracts statement-URL pairs=
 from reports and verifies whether cited sources actually support the claim=
s made, measuring both citation accuracy and the total volume of verifiable=
 information retrieved.
What are the key findings? When evaluating leading DRAs, Gemini-2.5-Pro Dee=
p Research achieved the highest overall performance with a RACE score of 48=
=2E88 and an impressive 111.21 effectiv=
e citations per task - far exceeding o=
ther models. However, citation accuracy varied significantly: while Perplex=
ity Deep Research achieved 90.24% citation accuracy, Gemini and OpenAI's of=
ferings lagged at around 77-81%. The RACE framework demonstrated remarkable=
 human alignment, achieving 71.33% pairwise agreement with expert evaluator=
s - actually exceeding the 68.44% agreement between human experts themselve=
s. Among general LLMs with search tools, Claude-3.7-Sonnet performed surpri=
singly well, even outscoring some specialized DRAs.
Why does it matter? The high human consistency of the evaluation frameworks=
 means developers can now reliably benchmark their systems without expensiv=
e human evaluation at scale. The results reveal a critical trade-off: model=
s that retrieve the most information don't necessarily cite it most accurat=
ely, highlighting different architectural strengths. Perhaps most important=
ly, by grounding the benchmark in real user needs and making both the datas=
et and evaluation tools open-source, this research provides a concrete targ=
et for advancing DRAs toward practical, trustworthy systems that can genuin=
ely augment human research capabilities.

em does it solve?</strong><span> Current LLM benchmarks for competitive pro=
gramming focus on short-duration, pass/fail problems with exact solutions. =
However, real-world algorithm engineering often involves NP-hard optimizati=
on problems where finding the true optimum is computationally infeasible.  =
ALE-Bench is a new benchmark based on AtCoder Heuristic Contests, where par=
ticipants spend weeks iteratively refining solutions to maximize scores rat=
her than achieving binary correctness. This tests AI systems' ability for l=
ong-horizon reasoning and continuous improvement, essential for industrial =
optimization tasks like routing and scheduling.</span></p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><str=
ong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> The authors developed ALE=
-Agent, which combines two key methods. Method 1 injects domain knowledge d=
irectly into prompts, providing guidance on standard algorithm engineering =
techniques like simulated annealing and beam search, including search space=
 design and acceleration tricks. Method 2 employs diversity-oriented search=
 using best-first search with a beam width of 30, generating multiple child=
 nodes simultaneously to avoid local optima. This approach generated approx=
imately 1000 solution codes compared to ~100 for standard iterative refinem=
ent, with parallelized candidate generation to manage API latency effective=
ly.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings? </strong><spa=
n>ALE-Agent dramatically outperformed other solutions, achieving an average=
 performance of 1879 (top 6.8%) compared to sequential refinement approache=
s like o4-mini-high (1411), Gemini 2.5 Pro (1198), and GPT-4.1 mini (1016).=
 The performance distribution showed remarkable consistency with 100% of pr=
oblems achieving =E2=89=A5400 performance and 70% achieving =E2=89=A51600 p=
erformance. Its greatest achievement was scoring 2880 on problem AHC039, pl=
acing 5th in the original human contest.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why=
 does it matter? </strong><span>These results demonstrate that sophisticate=
d scaffolding can elevate AI performance from novice/intermediate levels to=
 compete with human experts in algorithm engineering. The synergistic effec=
t of combining domain knowledge with extensive search (61.1% improvement fr=
om base) shows that the right architectural choices matter more than raw mo=
del capability alone. This has immediate practical implications for deployi=
ng AI in industrial optimization domains like package delivery, crew schedu=
ling, and power-grid balancing, where even small improvements can yield sig=
nificant real-world impact.</span></p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;line-he=

What problem does it solve?</strong><span> Language models typically rely o=
n tokenization schemes like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) that chop text into fi=
xed vocabulary units before training even begins. This creates a rigid syst=
em where models are locked into a specific granularity - they can't access =
individual characters when needed for tasks like spelling, yet they're forc=
ed to process common words as multiple tokens. The tokenizer becomes a bott=
leneck: models struggle with rare languages not well-represented in the voc=
abulary, fail at character-level reasoning, and require massive embedding t=
ables that map each token ID to a vector while obscuring obvious relationsh=

e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem? </s=
trong><span>AU-Net (Autoregressive U-Net) processes raw bytes directly and =
learns its own hierarchical tokenization during training. The architecture =
uses a U-Net design with contracting and expanding paths: Stage 1 processes=
 individual bytes, Stage 2 pools at word boundaries, Stage 3 at word pairs,=
 and Stage 4 at four-word chunks. Instead of using lookup tables, AU-Net em=
ploys attention mechanisms to create contextualized embeddings at each leve=
l. The key innovation is that deeper stages naturally predict further into =
the future - while Stage 1 predicts the next byte, Stage 4 effectively pred=
icts the next four words, creating an implicit multi-scale prediction objec=
tive without auxiliary losses.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the =
key findings? </strong><span>When evaluated under identical compute budgets=
, AU-Net matches or exceeds strong BPE baselines across multiple benchmarks=
, with deeper hierarchies (2-3 stages) showing particularly promising scali=
ng trends. The architecture excels at character-level manipulation tasks on=
 the CUTE benchmark and demonstrates superior cross-lingual generalization =
on FLORES-200, especially for low-resource languages that share orthographi=
c patterns with better-represented languages. For instance, on a 1B paramet=
er model trained on 370B tokens, AU-Net-3 achieves 72.9% on HellaSwag compa=
red to 70.2% for the BPE baseline, while AU-Net-4 reaches 31.7% on MMLU ver=
sus 27.0% for BPE.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </str=
ong><span>This challenges the assumption that tokenization must be a separa=
te preprocessing step, showing that models can learn their own adaptive rep=
resentations while maintaining competitive performance. By operating on raw=
 bytes, AU-Net eliminates vocabulary constraints, enabling better handling =
of morphologically rich languages, code switching, and character-level reas=
oning - all without sacrificing the efficiency benefits of hierarchical pro=
cessing. The approach is particularly valuable for multilingual application=
s and low-resource languages, where traditional tokenizers often fail. More=
 broadly, it suggests that many &quot;fixed&quot; components of the LLM pip=
eline might benefit from being learned end-to-end, opening new avenues for =
more flexible and capable language models.</span></p><div style=3D"font-siz=

font-size: 16px;"><strong>What problem does it solve? </strong><span>Deep R=
esearch Agents (DRAs) have emerged as one of the most widely deployed categ=
ories of LLM-based agents, capable of autonomously orchestrating web explor=
ation, retrieval, and synthesis to transform hours of manual desk research =
into minutes. However, evaluating these agents comprehensively remains a ma=
jor challenge. Current benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities like web b=
rowsing or text generation, but fail to assess the end-to-end performance o=
f agents conducting actual deep research. Moreover, evaluating the quality =
of lengthy research reports is inherently subjective - there's no clear &qu=
ot;ground truth&quot; for complex research queries, and the agents' interna=
l reasoning processes remain opaque.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How doe=
s it solve the problem? </strong><span>DeepResearchBench was built by first=
 analyzing 96,147 real user queries to understand actual research needs, ul=
timately identifying 44,019 that qualified as deep research tasks. They rec=
ruited PhD-level experts across 22 domains to craft 100 high-quality benchm=
ark tasks that reflect this real-world distribution. To evaluate DRAs, they=
 developed two novel frameworks: RACE dynamically generates task-specific e=
valuation criteria and weights, then uses reference-based scoring to compar=
e reports - essentially asking &quot;how does this report compare to a high=
-quality reference?&quot; rather than scoring in isolation. FACT extracts s=
tatement-URL pairs from reports and verifies whether cited sources actually=
 support the claims made, measuring both citation accuracy and the total vo=
lume of verifiable information retrieved.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Wh=
at are the key findings? </strong><span>When evaluating leading DRAs, Gemin=
i-2.5-Pro Deep Research achieved the highest overall performance with a RAC=
E score of 48.88 and an impressive 111.21 effective citations per task - fa=
r exceeding other models. However, citation accuracy varied significantly: =
while Perplexity Deep Research achieved 90.24% citation accuracy, Gemini an=
d OpenAI's offerings lagged at around 77-81%. The RACE framework demonstrat=
ed remarkable human alignment, achieving 71.33% pairwise agreement with exp=
ert evaluators - actually exceeding the 68.44% agreement between human expe=
rts themselves. Among general LLMs with search tools, Claude-3.7-Sonnet per=
formed surprisingly well, even outscoring some specialized DRAs.</span></p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span>The high human cons=
istency of the evaluation frameworks means developers can now reliably benc=
hmark their systems without expensive human evaluation at scale. The result=
s reveal a critical trade-off: models that retrieve the most information do=
n't necessarily cite it most accurately, highlighting different architectur=
al strengths. Perhaps most importantly, by grounding the benchmark in real =
user needs and making both the dataset and evaluation tools open-source, th=
is research provides a concrete target for advancing DRAs toward practical,=
 trustworthy systems that can genuinely augment human research capabilities=
