Hi Mary,

Unfortunately, our legal department is not satisfied with the terms in the
contract and are concerned about the interpretation of Sunday being the
employer vs VAA in an audit. Therefore we will not be moving forwards with
VAA at this time.

Thanks

James

>> role of directing the VA's day-to-day tasks and managing their work
>> product, similar to how they would manage an employee hired directly.
>> This division of responsibilities is reflected in the agreement's terms
>> and the pricing structure. The allocation of risks mirrors this operatio=
nal
>> model =E2=80=93 the Company takes responsibility for the sourcing and ba=
sic

nt

>> are not merely legal points but touch upon this fundamental commercial
>> structure. Our responses aim to maintain this balance, which allows the
>> Company to offer its services at the current competitive rates.
>> Please find our responses to your specific comments below, following the
>> section numbering in your email:
>>
>>    - 2.1 (VA Suitability & Basis): We accept the addition of the word
>>    "suitable". However, we cannot delete the "As Is" and "As Available" =
basis.
>>    The Company provides VAs based on the pool of trained personnel avail=
able
>>    at any given time. While we always strive to find the best match, we =
cannot
>>    guarantee the constant availability of VAs meeting every specific
>>    requirement instantly.
>>    - 2.4 (VA Management): The proposed deletion is not acceptable. This
>>    clause is central to our operating model. The day-to-day management o=
f the
>>    VAs, including task assignment and supervision, must remain solely wi=
th the
>>    Customer. The Company provides VAs who have undergone relevant traini=
ng
>>    based on the needs defined by the Customer, but we do not manage thei=
r
>>    ongoing work or service-related activities. The proposed addition reg=
arding
>>    alignment with Customer requirements is acceptable in principle, as i=
t
>>    reflects the intended relationship.
>>    - 2.9 (VA Termination Notice): We accept the change from 15 to 30
>>    days regarding the advance notice we seek from VAs. However, please n=
ote
>>    that this reflects a "reasonable commercial effort" on our part, as s=
tated
>>    in the clause. We cannot contractually guarantee that every VA will a=
dhere
>>    to this notice period, although we make every effort to enforce it.
>>    - 3.2 (Timeframe Discrepancy): The proposed addition requiring
>>    written evidence and a timestamp signed by the VA in case of discrepa=
ncies
>>    is acceptable.
>>    - 3.3 (Payment Due Date): This is a commercial point. The Company's
>>    standard terms, reflecting its cash flow management for VA payments,
>>    require payment by the 10th of the month for the invoice issued at th=
e
>>    beginning of that month. Changing this to thirty days after receipt
>>    significantly alters the commercial basis. We request that this claus=
e
>>    remains as originally drafted.
>>    - 5.2 (Employer Acknowledgment): The proposed addition clarifying
>>    that the Company is the sole employer of the VAs and responsible for
>>    employment-related obligations (wages, taxes in the Philippines, etc.=
) is
>>    acceptable.
>>    - 6.3 (Confidentiality): The proposed deletion/change is not
>>    acceptable. This clause accurately reflects the operational reality a=
nd
>>    risk allocation. The Company recruits, trains, and manages assignment=
s and
>>    payments. Confidential Information disclosed *directly* by the
>>    Customer to the VA is managed within that direct relationship. The Co=
mpany
>>    cannot assume liability for breaches of confidentiality by VAs concer=
ning
>>    information it was never privy to. Our liability is limited to Confid=
ential
>>    Information disclosed *to the Company* itself.
>>    - 7.4 (IP Rights Liability): The proposed deletion is not acceptable.
>>    Consistent with the model where the Customer directs the VA's work, t=
he
>>    responsibility for ensuring the VA's work does not infringe third-par=
ty IP
>>    rights rests with the Customer. The Company provides trained personne=
l but
>>    does not oversee the specific tasks or content created. This risk
>>    allocation is factored into the service pricing.
>>    - 8.1 (Limitation of Liability - Negligence): The addition of "gross
>>    negligence" as an exception to the limitation of liability for the
>>    Company's actions is not acceptable. The Company's liability is limit=
ed to
>>    damages resulting from its own willful misconduct. Regarding the
>>    carve-outs, we agree that the limitation of liability shall not apply=
 where
>>    liability is mandatory under the governing law, which is Israeli law.=
 We
>>    propose amending the end of the sentence to reflect this: "...or wher=
e
>>    liability is mandatory under applicable Israeli law (e.g., statutory
>>    provisions that cannot be contractually excluded)."
>>    - 8.2 (Liability for VA Actions): Similarly, adding "gross
>>    negligence" here is not acceptable. The Company is not liable for dam=
ages
>>    caused by VAs, unless directly resulting from the Company's own willf=
ul
>>    misconduct.
>>    - 8.3 (Compliance with Laws & Indemnity): The proposed addition
>>    regarding the Company's compliance with applicable labor, tax, and
>>    employment laws in the Philippines (and other locations where VAs mig=
ht be
>>    based) is acceptable. The indemnification obligation for the Customer
>>    against claims arising from the Company's non-compliance in these spe=
cific
>>    areas is also acceptable.
>>    - 8.4 (VA Equipment Warranty): We can represent that VAs use their
>>    own computing equipment. However, we cannot warrant that this equipme=
nt
>>    universally meets unspecified standards for hardware, software, and d=
ata
>>    security necessary for *all* potential client tasks. Data security
>>    policies and the funding for any specific or enhanced security measur=
es
>>    (special software, hardware, VPNs, etc.) required by the Customer's
>>    internal policies must be the responsibility of the Customer, who dir=
ects
>>    the VA's work and understands the sensitivity of the data being handl=
ed.
>>    The Company cannot bear responsibility or cost for client-specific IT
>>    security requirements.
>>    - 10.4 (Governing Law & Jurisdiction): The request to change the
>>    governing law and jurisdiction to Switzerland/Zurich is not acceptabl=
e. The
>>    agreement shall remain governed by the laws of the State of Israel, w=
ith
>>    exclusive jurisdiction granted to the competent courts in Tel Aviv-Ja=
ffa.
>>    - Signature Line: We accept the request and will add a second
>>    signature line for Sunday Natural's Managing Directors.
>>
>> We believe these positions reasonably reflect the commercial nature of
>> the services provided and the associated risk allocation. We hope this

>> We are available to discuss any of these points further should you wish.

Thank you for your email and for providing the detailed comments from your =
legal team on the draft Services Agreement. My name is Eitan Shamir, and I =
serve as legal counsel for VAA Philippines (the &quot;Company&quot;). Gilad=
 asked me to review your comments and respond
 directly.</div>

We appreciate the thorough review and the suggestions aimed at reaching a m=
utually agreeable contract. We are certainly keen to establish a successful=
 partnership with Sunday Natural.</div>

Before addressing the specific clauses, I'd like to provide some context re=
garding the Company's business model, which informs the structure and risk =
allocation in the agreement. The Company's core service is to recruit, vet,=
 and train qualified Virtual Assistants
 (VAs) in the Philippines, making them available to clients like yourselves=
. This model saves clients significant overhead associated with the recruit=
ment, hiring, and initial training processes. Consequently, the client (Sun=
day Natural) assumes the role of
 directing the VA's day-to-day tasks and managing their work product, simil=
ar to how they would manage an employee hired directly.</div>

ock;font-family:Aptos,Aptos_EmbeddedFont,Aptos_MSFontService,Calibri,Helvet=
ica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">
This division of responsibilities is reflected in the agreement's terms and=
 the pricing structure. The allocation of risks mirrors this operational mo=
del =E2=80=93 the Company takes responsibility for the sourcing and basic t=
raining, while the client takes responsibility
 for the ongoing management and the outcomes of the VA's work. Therefore, m=
any of the comments below are not merely legal points but touch upon this f=
undamental commercial structure. Our responses aim to maintain this balance=
, which allows the Company to offer
 its services at the current competitive rates.</div>

<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Hi James,<br>
<br>
Thank you for reaching out. To answer your question, at VAA Philippines, we=
 have a comprehensive process in place to ensure that you are matched with =
a VA who meets your specific requirements. Here's an overview of our proces=
s and the services we offer:<br>
<br>
<b>Recruitment &amp; Filtering:</b>&nbsp;We recruit potential VAs based on =
their skills, experience, and suitability for the role. We also conduct emp=
loyment and character background checks to ensure reliability and we pre-sc=
reen and interview VAs before recruiting
 them.<br>
<br>
<b>Extensive Training:</b>&nbsp;Once selected, our VAs undergo a rigorous 4=
-week training program to ensure they are well-equipped to handle various t=
asks effectively and have knowledge on the basic processes in Amazon or Wal=
mart. In addition to the training we
 give our VAs, we continuously support and train them even after they are a=
lready connected with the sellers.<br>
<br>
<b>Matching: </b>After completing their training, we match the VAs with sel=
lers based on their expertise and the specific needs of the business.<br>
<br>
<b>Continued Support: </b>Our team provides ongoing assistance to ensure sm=
ooth collaboration between you and your VA, including handling the VA's pay=
roll to ensure timely and accurate payments.<br>
<br>
<b>Performance Review:</b>&nbsp;We conduct check-ins to ensure performance =
expectations are met.<br>
<br>
By following this process, we aim to streamline the selection and onboardin=
g process for our clients, saving them time and ensuring they are matched w=
ith the right VA for their business needs and are consistently supported.<b=
r>
<br>
Additionally, it has been a long time since you had the conversation about =
our services and we'd be happy to schedule a new meeting with you in order =
to revisit the information and discuss new details about our services. We'r=
e also interested in understanding
 your business again in order to see how our Amazon trained VAs can assist =
you.<br>

<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Hello James,<br>
<br>
Happy New Year to you as well! I'll answer your questions below on Bridgitt=
e's behalf.<br>
<br>
1) The contract does not have any specific clauses about the VA's and confi=
dentiality. To rectify this, is it possible to ask the VA and VAA (the comp=
any as a whole) to sign NDA's?<br>
<span style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,255)">Of course, it's not a problem if you nee=
d your VA to sign an NDA with you directly. As for the company as a whole, =
our CEO, Gilad, can sign the NDA as well, but it will only be relevant to t=
he information that he and the
 other STAFF of VAA are exposed to and not the information you share with y=
our VA.</span><br>
<br>
2) Please can you confirm if the VA's are using their own laptops/computers=
 and how cyber security works when we are providing access to sensitive inf=
ormation?<br>
<span style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,255)">Yes, the VAs are using their own equipme=
nt (laptop or computer) to use when working. Since the VAs are working from=
 their homes, security is a risk that sellers should be taking. Our VAs mos=
tly use local networks here in
 the Philippines which are not entirely secure, however, the risk is very l=
ow. We have worked with a lot of VAs for the past 7 years, and security has=
 never been an issue with a lot of other sellers.<br>
<br>
To ensure cyber security when handling sensitive information, we advise cli=
ents to implement specific security measures such as granting access via li=
mited permissions, utilizing password management tools, and employing VPNs =
if needed.</span></div>

<br>
I'm Mary from VAA Philippines, Gilad's Executive Assistant. Bridgitte forwa=
rded your email to me and I'd be happy to address your requests.<br>
<br>
For the business address / location, below are the details.</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr"><br>
</div>
<div style=3D"direction:ltr;color:rgb(0,0,255)">Business Name: <b>F.D e-com=

<div style=3D"direction:ltr">Gilad, our CEO, can sign an NDA for any inform=
ation that he or our management team will be exposed to, which is not the i=
nfo that is given to the VA as the work between you is separated.<br>
<br>
If it's necessary, the assigned VA may also sign an NDA contract with you d=
irectly. You can let the VA sign it before he/she can start working with yo=
u.<br>
<br>
I'll also explain to you a brief summary of the process before connecting y=
ou with a VA. The first step would be the signing of the contract and sendi=
ng of the payment. The payment will be calculated from the suggested start =
date until the end of the month
 based on the number of hours you would like the VA to work for you, and in=
cluding the $250 one-time fee and $250 deposit (both are per department).<b=
r>
<br>
Once the payment and contract are completed, the next step would be the mee=
ting with the manager to have a detailed discussion and understand your nee=
ds in order to connect you with the VA best fit for the job. After the meet=
ing with the manager, they will
 be assessing and filtering our pool of available VAs. And, once they find =
the best VA, they will connect you with the VA.<br>
<br>
I hope this information was helpful. If you're ready to proceed, please let=
 me know and I will guide you through the process.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Mary</div>
