July 14=2C 2025

Question: You=E2=80=99ve written that the lack of warning on the flooding=
 was due partly to a very limited government in Kerr County and a warning=
 system. How do you fix this problem?

Response:
Since then=2C I have learned that there were warnings from the National We=
ather Service. San Antonio had issued a flood watch in the Hill Country (a=
nd elsewhere) on July 3 at 1:18 p.m. The National Water Center Area Hydrol=
ogic Discussion issued a considerable flood warning at 6:22 p.m. on July 3=
 for areas including the city of Kerrville. Both were sent as text message=
s to all cell phones in the area. It should be noted that a flash flood wa=
rning in the Hill Country is the same as a snow warning in Vermont in Dece=
mber. A flash flood indicates the rapidity of and not the depth of the wat=
er in low lying areas. Flash flooding in itself is not dangerous.

Then at 1:14 a.m. on July 4=2C a flash flood warning was issued with the t=
ag =E2=80=9Cconsiderable.=E2=80=9D (There are three levels of warning. The=
re is a warning with no level of impact=2C a warning tagged =E2=80=9Cconsi=
derable=E2=80=9D and one tagged =E2=80=9Ccatastrophic.=E2=80=9D) The warni=
ng was sent via text messages to enabled mobile devices=2C and also issued=
 on the radio. At about 4:35 a.m.=2C the Kerr County sheriff=E2=80=99s off=
ice sent a warning as the river was flooding at low level crossings. So th=
e first warning of a significant or considerable event was sent at 1:14 a.=
m. on July 4. Subsequent warnings upgraded it to an emergency for south Ke=
rr County at 4:03 a.m. and by 5:34 a.m.

So the flooding was forecast=2C and warnings were distributed the day befo=
re. During the night=2C the forecast elevated to levels called considerabl=
e but not catastrophic. Weather forecasting is a science=2C but determinin=
g the intensity of the weather is hard to do. In this sense the technology=
 did not fail=2C and warnings=2C particularly the =E2=80=9Cconsiderable=E2=
=80=9D warning=2C was in place.

But warnings have to be delivered and read. The problem is that because th=
e significance of the event did not emerge until after midnight=2C many pe=
ople were already asleep. So it cannot be said that warnings weren=E2=80=
=99t issued and upgraded enough for the recipients to be concerned. Howeve=
r=2C the problem with cell phone warnings is that cell phone connectivity=
 is not always reliable. Many people turn off their cell phones when they=
 go to sleep=2C while others leave them in another room. So even though th=
e warning was given and delivered=2C the critical warning=2C the one that=
 would alert others=2C was delivered by a means that was unreliable in the=
 idiosyncratic Hill County.

Some would argue that there should have been siren. The problem with siren=
s is that they tell you something is up but not what it is. It could be a=
 fire=2C a car wreck or a flood. Also=2C the audio range of a siren is abo=
ut two miles=2C and as distance grows=2C the sound declines. It is easy to=
 assume that a distant siren could be a police or fire engine rushing to a=
n emergency. It is very possible to sleep through a siren=2C or to confuse=
 its nature=2C and not know what the emergency is. The problem in my mind=
 was not so much the forecast=2C nor the lack of warning=2C but the fact t=
hat the method of warning depended on the recipient=E2=80=99s relationship=
 with cell phones. The other problem is that weather forecasting is able t=
o identify the weather in general but not specific to place nor to intensi=
ty. In these circumstances=2C the idea that there was no warning given was=
 not true. There was a rough warning but the reliability of the cell phone=
 varies by location and time of delivery. And the last is the limit of
technology.

Question: You write about geopolitical trends in many parts of the world t=
hat have over the years come true =E2=80=93 the Russians attacking Ukraine=
=2C China=E2=80=99s economic slowdown =E2=80=93 to name a couple. Why woul=
d someone so deep into analyzing and forecasting what happens in the world=
 want to distance himself from it by living in the Hill Country which is a=
lso so different from where you grew up in densely populated New York=E2=
=80=99s Bronx?

Response:

Growing up in the Bronx was the foundation of my aversion to people. Later=
=2C I was a professor for a couple of decades=2C which compounded that ave=
rsion; colleagues and students and my occasional forays in government ceme=
nted my desire to be alone. So I decided to continue my work in geopolitic=
s and intelligence by selling my analysis in the private sector. There wer=
e risks=2C but having grown up in the Bronx=2C my calculus of risk is diff=
erent than most. At least my customers can=E2=80=99t knife me. I have a wi=
fe who is a bigger risk taker than me and thought it was a great idea. Eve=
ryone else thought I was demented. My business demanded that I anticipate=
 what will happen in the world. My life in the Bronx gave me insight into=
 how nations behaved=2C while the beauty and quiet of the Hill Country fre=
ed me from the noise of the world. I travel to far corners of the world on=
 occasion and then come home to a place of serenity. Who could want more?=
 Hegel once wrote that if you look at the world rationally=2C the
world will show itself to you rationally=2C a mutual relationship. And her=
e I can be rational about the world.

Question: We used to hear that there was a population explosion that would=
 cause devastation by the end of the 20th century. Now we hear there will=
 be a labor shortage due to the low birth rates and a decline in populatio=
n numbers.  China had a one child policy for years. How much should govern=
ments be involved in demographic issues and should we look to immigration=
 from over-populated countries to help solve America=E2=80=99s labor issue=
s?

Response:

I have several good jokes playing around in my head on government and the=
 birth rate but I will spare you them. On the serious side=2C the job of g=
overnments is to protect the national interest.  The problem of old age is=
 that the elderly are not productive on the whole but consume a great deal=
=2C particularly in the medical area. There is a national interest at this=
 point in maintaining productivity for as much of their lives as possible.=
 That is the problem of medical research. What governments can do is fund=
 and increase that research. On the other side of the equation=2C increasi=
ng the birth rate would be desirable (joke deleted)=2C and the government=
 could offer financial incentives for women having babies. But beyond that=
=2C the fact that balancing birth rates and life expectancy is in the nati=
on=E2=80=99s interest. The decline in the birth rate is rooted in the shif=
ting of cultural norms as to the role of women in society=2C along with th=
e financial realities of raising children.

So while governments=2C given their mission=2C have an interest in birth r=
ate=2C the government would have to redefine cultural norms=2C and that is=
 something they are bad at. So I think the government could be helpful on=
 one side of the equation but not the other. It should be added that the U=
nited States=2C as a rapidly growing economy=2C has frequently had the imp=
erative to expand its population=2C something that has historically been s=
olved by immigration =E2=80=93 no one but a Native Americans can claim not=
 to descend from or be migrants to the U.S. But migrants historically crea=
te social stresses while enhancing  the economy=2C so this has to be hande=
d flexibly and subtly=2C which is not a strong suit of governments. At the=
 same time=2C that is the historic solution to increase over time the work=
 force in America.

<br>
<strong>Response: </strong></p>

<div>Since then, I have learned that there were warnings from the National =
Weather Service. San Antonio had issued a flood watch in the Hill Country (=
and elsewhere) on July 3 at 1:18 p.m. The National Water Center Area Hydrol=
ogic Discussion issued a considerable flood warning at 6:22 p.m. on July 3 =
for areas including the city of Kerrville. Both were sent as text messages =
to all cell phones in the area. It should&nbsp;be noted that a flash flood =
warning in the Hill Country is the same as a snow warning in Vermont in Dec=
ember. A flash flood indicates the rapidity of and not the depth of the wat=
er in low lying areas. Flash flooding in itself is not dangerous.<br>
<br>
Then at 1:14 a.m. on July 4, a flash flood warning was issued with the tag =
=E2=80=9Cconsiderable.=E2=80=9D (There are three levels of warning. There i=
s a warning with no level of impact, a warning tagged =E2=80=9Cconsiderable=
=E2=80=9D and one tagged =E2=80=9Ccatastrophic.=E2=80=9D) The warning was s=
ent via text messages to enabled mobile devices, and also issued on the rad=
io. At about 4:35 a.m., the Kerr County sheriff=E2=80=99s office sent a war=
ning as the river was flooding at low level crossings. So the first warning=
 of a significant or considerable event was sent at 1:14 a.m. on July 4. Su=
bsequent warnings upgraded it to an emergency for south Kerr County at 4:03=
 a.m. and by 5:34 a.m.&nbsp;a Flash Flood Emergency was sent out for the Gu=
adalupe River.<br>
<br>
So the flooding was forecast, and warnings were distributed the day before.=
 During the night, the forecast elevated to levels called considerable but =
not catastrophic. Weather forecasting is a science, but determining the int=
ensity of the weather is hard to do. In this sense the technology did not f=
ail, and warnings, particularly the =E2=80=9Cconsiderable=E2=80=9D warning,=
 was in place.<br>
<br>
But warnings have to be delivered and read. The problem is that because the=
 significance of the event did not emerge until after midnight, many people=
 were already asleep. So it cannot be said that warnings weren=E2=80=99t is=
sued and upgraded enough for the recipients to be concerned.&nbsp;However, =
the problem with cell phone warnings is that cell phone connectivity is not=
 always reliable. Many people turn off their cell phones when they go to sl=
eep, while others leave them in another room. So even though the warning wa=
s given and delivered, the critical warning, the one that would alert other=
s, was delivered by a means that was unreliable in the idiosyncratic Hill C=
ounty.<br>
<br>
Some would argue that there should have been siren. The problem with sirens=
 is that they tell you something is up but not what it is. It could be a fi=
re, a car wreck or a flood. Also, the audio range of a siren is about two m=
iles, and as distance grows, the sound declines. It is easy to assume that =
a distant siren could be a police or fire engine rushing to an emergency. I=
t is very possible to sleep through a siren, or to confuse its nature, and =
not know what the emergency is. The problem in my mind was not so much the =
forecast, nor the lack of warning, but the fact that the method of warning =
depended on the recipient=E2=80=99s relationship with cell phones. The othe=
r problem is that weather forecasting is able to identify the weather in ge=
neral but not specific to place nor to intensity. In these circumstances, t=
he idea that there was no warning given was not true. There was a rough war=
ning but the reliability of the cell phone varies by location and time of d=
elivery. And the last is the limit of technology.</div>

<strong>Response:</strong><br>
<br>
Growing up in the Bronx was the foundation of my aversion to people. Later,=
 I was a professor for a couple of decades, which compounded that aversion;=
 colleagues and students and my occasional forays in government cemented my=
 desire to be alone. So I decided to continue my work in geopolitics and in=
telligence by selling my analysis in the private sector. There were risks, =
but having grown up in the Bronx, my calculus of risk is different than mos=
t. At least my customers can=E2=80=99t knife me. I have a wife who is a big=
ger risk taker than me and thought it was a great idea. Everyone else thoug=
ht I was demented. My business demanded that I anticipate what will happen =
in the world. My life in the Bronx gave me insight into how nations behaved=
, while the beauty and quiet of the Hill Country freed me from the noise of=
 the world. I travel to far corners of the world on occasion and then come =
home to a place of serenity. Who could want more? Hegel once wrote that if =
you look at the world rationally, the world will show itself to you rationa=
lly, a mutual relationship. And here I can be rational about the world.</p>

<br>
<strong>Response:</strong><br>
<br>
I have several good jokes playing around in my head on government and the b=
irth rate but I will spare you them. On the serious side, the job of govern=
ments is to protect the national interest.&nbsp; The problem of old age is =
that the elderly are not productive on the whole but consume a great deal, =
particularly in the medical area. There is a national interest at this poin=
t in maintaining productivity for as much of their lives as possible. That =
is the problem of medical research. What governments can do is fund and inc=
rease that research. On the other side of the equation, increasing the birt=
h rate would be desirable (joke deleted), and the government could offer fi=
nancial incentives for women having babies. But beyond that, the fact that =
balancing birth rates and life expectancy is in the nation=E2=80=99s intere=
st. The decline in the birth rate is rooted in the shifting of cultural nor=
ms as to the role of women in society, along with the financial realities o=
f raising children.<br>
<br>
So while governments, given their mission, have an interest in birth rate, =
the government would have to redefine cultural norms, and that is something=
 they are bad at. So I think the government could be helpful on one side of=
 the equation but not the other. It should be added that the United States,=
 as a rapidly growing economy, has frequently had the imperative to expand =
its population, something that has historically been solved by immigration =
=E2=80=93 no one but a Native Americans can claim not to descend from or be=
 migrants to the U.S. But migrants historically create social stresses whil=
e enhancing&nbsp; the economy, so this has to be handed flexibly and subtly=
, which is not a strong suit of governments. At the same time, that is the =
historic solution to increase over time the work force in America.</p>
