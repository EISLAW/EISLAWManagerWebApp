DAILY MEMO: IAEA ASSESSES DAMAGE, NETANYAHU HOLDS FIRM [3]
IRAN'S URANIUM ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE TAKEN A SEVERE HIT.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
DAMAGE DONE. There are no signs that the fighting between Israel and Iran will let up any time soon, but authorities are already assessing the damage. The chief of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Rafael Grossi, said [4]all 15,000 centrifuges at Iran’s largest uranium enrichment plant in Natanz have been severely damaged or destroyed by a power outage caused by Israeli airstrikes. As
for the shipping industry, more than 900 vessels have reportedly experienced navigational problems [5] in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf amid the fighting. The problems include “extreme
jamming” of GPS signals emanating from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Ship owners have been forced to navigate instead by radar and compass, which increases the risk of accidents. Some shipping
companies have temporarily suspended visits to the Persian Gulf.
WASHINGTON'S STANCE. The U.S., meanwhile, is in talks with Iran on holding a meeting this week to discuss a possible resolution. U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly believes [6] the possible
transfer of bunker buster bombs to Israel will be a key source of leverage for the U.S. in the negotiations. Relatedly, Iranian lawmakers are preparing a bill [7] to withdraw Iran from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
ISRAEL'S LIMITS. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to rule out assassinating Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei when asked about the matter in a new interview [8], saying
Israel was “doing what we need to do.” Responding to media reports that Trump rejected Israeli plans to kill Khamenei, Netanyahu said the move would essentially end the conflict, rather than lead
to escalation. He said it was in the U.S. interest to support Israel in its efforts to eliminate Iran’s nuclear program.
AID FROM PYONGYANG. North Korea will send 1,000 troops and 5,000 military construction workers to help reconstruction and demining efforts in Russia’s Kursk region. The head of Russia’s Security
Council, Sergei Shoigu, announced the decision [9] following his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang on Tuesday, his second visit to the country in a month. The Security
Council’s press service had said [10] Shoigu was on a “special assignment” for the Russian president related to the strategic partnership agreement the two countries signed last year.
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS. Russian daily Vedomosti reported that global oil and gas companies are reconsidering their investments in renewable energy projects. The outlet cited a review of the oil market
published by Russian consulting firm Kept [11] that concluded that global demand for oil continues to grow and that the largest players in the industry are seeking to adapt their investments. BP, for
example, plans to increase investments in oil and gas projects by 20 percent to $10 billion per year, while Shell admitted that investments in low-carbon energy projects in 2024 were unprofitable.
Chevron, meanwhile, plans to reduce investments in low-carbon ventures by about 25 percent in 2025 to $1.5 billion.
NO PROGRESS. The European Union has canceled an economic meeting with China ahead of a leaders’ summit in July, the Financial Times reported [12]. The decision was apparently a result of the lack of
progress in resolving multiple trade disputes.
FOCUS ON DRONES. Taiwan has signed a strategic partnership agreement with U.S.-German company Auterion [13] to acquire drone software battle-tested in Ukraine, aiming to strengthen its defenses
against China. The deal includes uncrewed systems and drone swarming technologies that have proved effective in Ukraine against Russian tanks and naval assets. Auterion’s CEO said it would be a
long-term project, potentially producing millions of drones valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.
WATER ISSUES. India has launched a feasibility study focused on building a canal to divert water from Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan states. The project would affect the flow of
water from rivers included in the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan – which was suspended in April following a terrorist attack in the Kashmir region that Indian authorities blamed on a
Pakistani militant group.
REGIONAL SUMMIT. China and the countries of Central Asia are holding a leaders’ summit in Astana [14]. Attendees will discuss strengthening regional cooperation, expanding political dialogue,
deepening trade and economic ties, developing transport and transit integration, energy, innovation and regional security.
