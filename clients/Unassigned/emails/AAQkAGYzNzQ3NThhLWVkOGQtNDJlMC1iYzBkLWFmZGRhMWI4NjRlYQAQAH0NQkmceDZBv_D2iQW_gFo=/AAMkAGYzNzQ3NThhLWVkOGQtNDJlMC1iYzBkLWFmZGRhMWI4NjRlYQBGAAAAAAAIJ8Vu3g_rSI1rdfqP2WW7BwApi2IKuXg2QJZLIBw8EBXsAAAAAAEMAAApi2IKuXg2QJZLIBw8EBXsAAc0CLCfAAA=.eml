k-norms-are-4000-years-old

How long have we done work, more or less? My video up there refers to Ea-n=
=C4=81=E1=B9=A3ir and his copper deal [ https://substack.com/redirect/988bb=
4d4-8351-4583-a576-c9c3b19ad017?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. I am that nerd. The point is we=E2=80=99ve been=
 doing business and work for at least ~4k years. Having spent significant t=
ime in a society transitioning out of hunter-gatherer mode I=E2=80=99d argu=
e we=E2=80=99ve been doing meaningful work for much much longer than that.=
=20
But the years aren=E2=80=99t really the point. The point is that we have ha=
d for all that time a reasonably reliable way to assess quality of work. We=
 were right there. We saw the work.
For most of human history, asking =E2=80=9CWhere are you?=E2=80=9D made no =
sense.
Well, not anymore. Just as we=E2=80=99ve disinter-mediated work geographica=
lly since 2000, AI is starting to disinter-mediate the semantic meaning of =
work, but AI is phenomenally good at producing semantically meaningful text=
=2E And it turns out a lot of knowledge=
 work (which has multiplied since 2000=
) revolves around text.
And so our categories of work are starting to break down. The way we think =
about work is starting to change. We=E2=80=99re starting to doubt ourselves=
=2E Is it good? Is my colleague using A=
I? What if I do use AI? Who will know?=
 So many secret thoughts. And for so many workers these are thoughts that a=
re scary to voice unless their leadership is aggressively pushing on AI-fri=
endly culture. The stakes are high, because the relationship between AI usa=
ge and job security is fraught.=20
So in that world what do we do? How do we restore meaning to work? It=E2=80=
=99s one of the most important questions in the world today, but I don=E2=
=80=99t think we=E2=80=99re talking about it with a real framework that=E2=
=80=99s consistent.=20
And I think that starts with acknowledging where we=E2=80=99ve been: we=E2=
=80=99ve always had intuitive ways of knowing whether work was good quality=
=2E So we=E2=80=99ve never had to complain=
 about it or define it before. Ea-n=
=C4=81=E1=B9=A3ir complained about his copper, but he didn=E2=80=99t doubt =
the quality bar. He complained precisely because the quality bar is known. =
That=E2=80=99s how it=E2=80=99s been throughout history: we=E2=80=99ve been=
 able to know by how someone talks if they know their domain. We=E2=80=99ve=
 been able to know how they gained confidence in a decision because we see =
them speak, write, meet, and annotate. We have known if a person was doing =
work of high value because we could trust that an achievement was done by t=
hem.=20
These things are not true anymore, and we don=E2=80=99t know what to do. An=
d that=E2=80=99s why I wrote this. I want us to have a framework for re-for=
ging norms at work that allow us to use AI constructively. I think that=E2=
=80=99s one of the most important things we can be doing right now. I=E2=80=
=99d love your take on the frame below. Let me know if it resonates!
Subscribers get all these posts!
Where We Are Today =E2=80=94 Drafts Are Free; Ownership Isn=E2=80=99t
A colleague drops a spotless requirements doc into Slack. Ninety seconds ea=
rlier it didn=E2=80=99t exist; one prompt to ChatGPT and=E2=80=94boom=E2=80=
=94eight crisp pages, diagram included. I scroll. It=E2=80=99s perfectly pl=
ausible. That=E2=80=99s the problem.
Have you ever been afraid of being asked who wrote this? What=E2=80=99s you=
r answer? Is =E2=80=9CAI wrote it=E2=80=9D an acceptable excuse? Words are =
cheap now, so what do they mean? They=E2=80=99re still incredibly powerful.=
 They still shape our world. Who takes responsibility for them? How do we r=
eshape work norms around them?
Here=E2=80=99s the new reality: the latency between intent and artifact has=
 collapsed to near-zero. Our old credibility signals=E2=80=94tracked change=
s, marathon workshops, time-stamped toil=E2=80=94evaporate in that compress=
ion. The speed is intoxicating, but it strips away the signals that allowed=
 us to judge work before. The question isn=E2=80=99t whether we should use =
the tools; it=E2=80=99s whether we can keep owning the work after the novel=
ty glow wears off.
This essay is my attempt to start to reconstruct a framework for work that =
survives the change. If an artifact can materialize in a minute, what matte=
rs? Drafts are free; ownership is not, and words still have power. In the p=
ages that follow I=E2=80=99ll lay out how I=E2=80=99m thinking about anchor=
ing that ownership in three habits any professional=E2=80=94PM, CS rep, mar=
keter, analyst=E2=80=94can practice every day.=20
For now, I=E2=80=99ll suggest that if we think about knowing our domains, k=
eeping a record of how we evolve our thinking, and gaining conviction in ho=
w we prove our work=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99ll discover that the underlying bone=
s of work haven=E2=80=99t changed. And that gives us a way forward in chang=
ing times.
The Know-Keep-Prove Framework for Work
I want to challenge you to return to craft, but update for velocity. As hin=
ted, I=E2=80=99ll frame this in three verbs=E2=80=94Know, Keep, Prove=E2=80=
=94easy to remember. Know insists that mastery can=E2=80=99t be outsourced =
to the model; you must still inhabit the logic. Keep suggests you need to h=
ave a record of gaining confidence to reliably and responsibly use AI. Prov=
e demands that reality=E2=80=94not rhetoric=E2=80=94decides whether the wor=
k was any good.=20
Together they form a lightweight, portable ethic that travels with you from=
 brainstorm to board deck. What follows unpacks each verb, shows how they i=
nterlock, and argues that adopting them is less about compliance than about=
 reclaiming the pride of ownership lost in the rush to instant output.
Know =E2=80=94 The Intimacy of Understanding
Before generative models arrived, we earned the label =E2=80=9Csubject-matt=
er expert=E2=80=9D largely by logging hours: the weeks spent researching a =
market, the long nights polishing a spec, the ritual of presenting each dra=
ft to a roomful of peers. That temporal investment bred familiarity, and fa=
miliarity was mistaken for mastery. Today a single, well-aimed prompt can c=
onjure a polished draft in less time than it takes to refill a coffee mug. =
The artifact still looks authoritative, but the incubation period=E2=80=94t=
he slow simmer in which ideas mingle, collide, and clarify=E2=80=94has vani=
shed. Know reclaims that lost intimacy. It is the deep, internal sense that=
 you could step away from every screen, pick up a whiteboard marker, and wa=
lk anyone=E2=80=94colleague, client, critic=E2=80=94through the logic of th=
e work without stumbling.
This intimacy is personal, but it is also ethical. When an LLM offers us a =
finished paragraph, it tempts us to outsource understanding along with comp=
osition. We nod at phrases that =E2=80=9Cfeel right,=E2=80=9D letting styli=
stic fluency masquerade as factual solidity. The risk isn=E2=80=99t just er=
ror; it=E2=80=99s abdication. If we propagate ideas we don=E2=80=99t truly =
grasp, we invite downstream teams=E2=80=94engineering, legal, finance=E2=80=
=94to build on sand. Know demands that we treat each turnkey draft not as a=
 verdict but as raw material, insisting on a second, human pass in which we=
 interrogate every causal claim and hidden assumption until the text feels =
less like a borrowed suit and more like our own skin.
Yet =E2=80=9Cknowing=E2=80=9D is bigger than solo mastery; it is relational=
=2E In fast-moving organizations, know=
ledge is validated collectively: a PM=
=E2=80=99s mental model must line up with Engineering=E2=80=99s threat scen=
arios and Marketing=E2=80=99s narrative logic. The best indicator that you =
know something is your ability to regenerate it coherently in new contexts=
=E2=80=94answer a sideways question from Legal, adapt a customer story for =
Sales, resolve a designer=E2=80=99s edge-case critique=E2=80=94without the =
prose wobbling. When we adopt Know as a shared standard, we surface misalig=
nments early, sparing the team from discovering too late that we were each =
holding different maps of the same territory.
Keep =E2=80=94 Custody of Thought, Scaled to Risk
Generative AI can make the drafting journey a blur of conversation: a singl=
e prompt yields a polished page and within a few quick turns you can spawn =
five derivative docs before lunch. In that blur, the journey from first not=
ion to final statement often disappears. Keep is gently challenging you to =
restore the integrity of that journey=E2=80=94not by recording every auto-c=
ompletion twitch, but by bookmarking the meaningful turns in our reasoning.=
 Think of it as version control for decisions: enough breadcrumbs that a te=
ammate joining tomorrow can understand why the work looks the way it does, =
without wading through an ocean of keystrokes.
Crucially, the weight of provenance should track the weight of consequence.=
 A low-stakes brainstorm may need nothing more than the final prompt and a =
one-line note on data sources. A feature spec that drives engineering effor=
t deserves a brief prompt chain and citations for external benchmarks. A fo=
recast that touches investor guidance or customer funds warrants the full a=
udit packet=E2=80=94prompt iterations, supporting datasets, and sign-offs. =
The point is reconstructable reasoning, not surveillance; we capture detail=
 only until a reasonable peer can rebuild confidence without starting from =
zero.
Balanced this way, Keep becomes an enabler, not a bureaucratic drag. When i=
n doubt, teams can retrace critical assumptions in minutes instead of repla=
ying Slack archaeology. When staff rotate, newcomers inherit a living map o=
f past choices rather than a stack of orphaned PDFs. And when regulators=E2=
=80=94or simply future skeptics=E2=80=94ask =E2=80=9CHow did you get here?=
=E2=80=9D, the organization answers with clarity instead of speculation. Pr=
ovenance is thus a guardrail for speed: light enough to keep momentum, stro=
ng enough to keep trust.
Prove =E2=80=94 Reality as Arbiter
I do believe that words are the code that enable us to write our dreams upo=
n the universe. And I acknowledge that it=E2=80=99s really weird to be in a=
 place where AI generated words are inescapably making dents in the univers=
e.=20
And that question of dents brings up prove and accountability and the whole=
 question of how we hold ourselves to a higher standard when it comes to ou=
tcomes. No shipping low grade copper here! More seriously, a requirements d=
oc, a financing model, a sales campaign=E2=80=94each can look impeccable ve=
ry quickly, long before anyone tests whether its predictions survive contac=
t with customers, regulators, or (lol) physics.=20
Prove pushes work back onto the unforgiving stage of the real world. It dec=
lares that an artifact=E2=80=99s worth is measured not by how persuasive it=
 reads in a vacuum but by whether it moves the needle it claims it will=E2=
=80=94conversion rate, uptime, renewal likelihood, defect escape, whatever =
scoreboard lies outside the drafting window.=20
Wasn=E2=80=99t that always the bar? Maybe it=E2=80=99s time to re-insist on=
 it. Without that tether, organizations risk drowning in eloquent mirages: =
Powerpoints that sound good to the board but don=E2=80=99t really lead to i=
mpactful software.
Elevating proof does more than gatekeep quality; it completes the epistemic=
 circuit started by Know and Keep. Understanding ensures the logic holds in=
ternally, custody ensures the reasoning remains visible, but only proof tes=
ts the whole contraption against external feedback. Do customers want it? W=
ell it turns out that=E2=80=99s still the bar, even in the age of AI. And a=
 human is accountable for that. We=E2=80=99ll go back to 1979 and how terri=
ble slide presentations used to be.
(Yes see now you understand why Powerpoint took over the world=E2=80=94it w=
as that bad before.)
Anyway, IBM is right. When a launch metric stalls, proof is not a finish li=
ne but a hinge: every outcome becomes new evidence that refines future prom=
pts and decisions. The loop between intention and impact tightens, turning =
AI=E2=80=99s speed from a liability into a learning accelerant.
Culturally, re-adopting Prove resets the incentive landscape. Teams that kn=
ow their artifacts will be judged by living numbers rather than by perceive=
d effort or rhetorical flair. You won=E2=80=99t be asked if you used AI or =
not if it works. And you will be asked if it doesn=E2=80=99t work but hones=
tly that=E2=80=99s fair and if you have a Prove culture the real question y=
ou=E2=80=99llb e asked is=E2=80=94why didn=E2=80=99t this work? What are yo=
u doing about it?=20
Proof restores humility to a posture of instant mastery; it reminds profess=
ionals that language models can simulate competence, but only real-world fe=
edback can validate it. By insisting that every deliverable face the scoreb=
oard, organizations reclaim the moral clarity that speed once obscured: suc=
cess is not how quickly you can draft=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s how reliably you=
 can bend reality toward your intent.
The Interlock =E2=80=94 How This Frame Interlocks
Together, though, this trio forms a flywheel. Deep understanding feeds a cl=
earer provenance log because experts annotate naturally. A transparent log =
accelerates diagnosis when outcomes lag, shortening the gap between observa=
tion and correction. Real-world feedback, in turn, hardens both knowledge a=
nd documentation, exposing soft spots that require a finer grasp or richer =
sourcing.=20
Over repeated cycles the organization stops treating AI drafts as endpoints=
 and starts treating them as catalysts for ever-tighter loops of insight, m=
emory, and validation=E2=80=94the very scaffolding that turns instant outpu=
t from a parlor trick into durable progress.
The point was never to avoid AI. The point was to recover a human sense of =
norms at work.
Culture Shift =E2=80=94 From Effort Signals to Evidence Signals
The moment an organization accepts Know =C2=B7 Keep =C2=B7 Prove as its ope=
rating grammar, the center of gravity for what counts as =E2=80=9Cgood work=
=E2=80=9D moves. Meetings once dominated by status updates=E2=80=94how many=
 hours, how many slides=E2=80=94begin to ask different questions: Can we tr=
ace this claim? What assumption underlies that forecast? Where will we see =
the first signal if we=E2=80=99re wrong? The conversational cadence slows j=
ust enough to surface logic, then speeds up because ambiguity drains away. =
When credibility is pegged to evidence rather than visible exertion, politi=
cal leverage based on overtime and theatrics withers; the quiet engineer wh=
o documents her reasoning suddenly wields more influence than the charismat=
ic manager who speaks in confident flourishes.
Look I know it might seem like dreaming to suggest this can fix some of our=
 long-standing issues, but stay with me. Imagine a world where that shift t=
akes root, cross-functional friction eases. Product no longer tosses a spec=
 over the wall and waits to see whether Engineering buys the story; Enginee=
ring can audit the provenance log, replay the thinking, and challenge shaky=
 premises before code is written. Marketing can pull the same thread to und=
erstand positioning choices, while Legal can review the decision snapshots =
for compliance exposure. Because lineage is explicit, critique can target c=
oncrete rungs in the chain instead of devolving into taste or authority. In=
 fact, AI makes this part easier by making it faster to check this stuff. D=
isagreement grows sharper but friendlier: the team argues about assumptions=
, not personalities.
Most tellingly, retrospectives stop resembling blame hunts and start readin=
g like laboratory notebooks. When a launch underperforms, the first instinc=
t is to walk the chain backward: Where did our mental model diverge from re=
ality, and what new evidence can we encode for next time? Failure is no lon=
ger a moral verdict on the author; it is a data point that tightens the loo=
p. Over time, teams that live inside this rhythm build an institutional ref=
lex: draft fast, expose thinking early, instrument outcomes, and feed the r=
esults back into the prompt space. The organization becomes self-correcting=
=E2=80=94not because AI made it smarter, but because people reclaimed respo=
nsibility for steering the engine they built.
From Ethic to Practice =E2=80=94 Awareness =E2=89=A0 Transformation
Adopting Know =C2=B7 Keep =C2=B7 Prove is conceptually simple; operationali=
zing it is anything but. Culture doesn=E2=80=99t pivot just because a sloga=
n circulates in Slack. People still prize speed, political capital, and the=
 comfort of familiar routines. People still think AI is a panacea (or the d=
evil).
If leadership rewards =E2=80=9Clooking busy,=E2=80=9D staff will continue t=
o showcase overtime logs even after you pin the new verbs on a wall. Conver=
sely, if you bolt lineage requirements onto every Jira ticket without carvi=
ng out review bandwidth, teams will treat provenance as ceremonial clutter =
and totally ignore it. What we need is a recovered sense of norms in a chan=
ging world.
Frankly, it probably starts with a conversation, and an expectation that th=
e shift will be incremental and uneven. We have too much to lose in a world=
 where AI is making words so cheaply. Unlike Ea-n=C4=81=E1=B9=A3ir we are a=
drift in a world of confusion, unsure how to judge our work, or the work of=
 others. This is infecting our hiring. It=E2=80=99s infecting our team cult=
ures. It=E2=80=99s infecting our ability to develop leaders. It=E2=80=99s t=
ime for it to go!
We deserve better. We deserve a world where we can reconstruct semantically=
 meaningful work without losing the acceleration AI brings, but it won=E2=
=80=99t just happen overnight. We have to fight for it. And frankly, if you=
 buy that AI agent colleagues are coming soon, this is a good chance to sta=
rt figuring that out because it is about to get more confusing if we don=E2=
=80=99t. Imagine figuring out chain of accountability if you haven=E2=80=99=
t done this work and Brenda the AI makes a big mistake! Much better to have=
 these norming conversations inside our businesses sooner than later.
No time like the present! Let me know below how this resonates for you. Wha=
t did I miss? What would you add? Where are your organizations on the AI ad=
option journey?

nts as =E2=80=9Cgood work=E2=80=9D moves. Meetings once dominated by status=
 updates=E2=80=94how many hours, how many slides=E2=80=94begin to ask diffe=

hat assumption underlies that forecast?</em><span> </span><em>Where will we=
 see the first signal if we=E2=80=99re wrong?</em><span> The conversational=
 cadence slows just enough to surface logic, then speeds up because ambigui=
ty drains away. When credibility is pegged to evidence rather than visible =
exertion, political leverage based on overtime and theatrics withers; the q=
uiet engineer who documents her reasoning suddenly wields more influence th=
an the charismatic manager who speaks in confident flourishes.</span></p><p=

n fix some of our long-standing issues, but stay with me. Imagine a world w=
here that shift takes root, cross-functional friction eases. Product no lon=
ger tosses a spec over the wall and waits to see whether Engineering buys t=
he story; Engineering can audit the provenance log, replay the thinking, an=
d challenge shaky premises before code is written. Marketing can pull the s=
ame thread to understand positioning choices, while Legal can review the de=
cision snapshots for compliance exposure. Because </span><em>lineage</em><s=
pan> is explicit, critique can target concrete rungs in the chain instead o=
f devolving into taste or authority. In fact, AI makes this part easier by =
making it faster to check this stuff. Disagreement grows sharper but friend=
lier: the team argues about assumptions, not personalities.</span></p><p st=

 first instinct is to walk the chain backward: </span><em>Where did our men=

t time?</em><span> Failure is no longer a moral verdict on the author; it i=
s a data point that tightens the loop. Over time, teams that live inside th=
is rhythm build an institutional reflex: draft fast, expose thinking early,=
 instrument outcomes, and feed the results back into the prompt space. The =
organization becomes self-correcting=E2=80=94not because AI made it smarter=
