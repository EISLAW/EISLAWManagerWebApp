Have you heard that old corporate chestnut =E2=80=9CPeople don=E2=80=99t qu=
it their jobs, they quit their managers=E2=80=9D? Most of us have had the e=
xperience of hearing a friend or colleague vent about their manager=E2=80=
=99s lack of support, micromanagement, missing product sense, unfair feedba=
ck, or some other reltionship problem that is as common as the day is long.
As I got more senior at Square=E2=80=94eventually leading all product, mark=
eting, and partnerships, spanning more than 800 colleagues and over 100 man=
agers=E2=80=94I heard these types of frustrations all the time, both at wor=
k and with friends. It happened with PMs, engineers, designers, and markete=
rs at all levels of seniority and tenure.
Over time, while the conversation stayed the same, my advice changed signif=
icantly. Instead of focusing on the individual=E2=80=99s manager, I now alw=
ays say, =E2=80=9CTell me about your manager=E2=80=99s manager.=E2=80=9D Th=
is person is also referred to as the =E2=80=9Cskip lead.=E2=80=9D
My focused questioning on skip leads usually surprises people. But there is=
 a reason for it, born of hard-won experience. In fact, I believe strongly =
that all manager challenges are either directly or indirectly about the ski=
p lead.
Instead of placing all the burden on the manager, we need to shift our anal=
ytic lens upward, onto the skip. After all, the skip lead hires the manager=
=2E They review the manager=E2=80=99s p=
erformance. They coach them=E2=80=94or=
 fail to.
Over the years, I=E2=80=99ve concluded that a lot of organizational leverag=
e comes from helping newly minted managers of managers become more effectiv=
e. Through conversation, talent reviews, and direct experience leading larg=
e organizations, I=E2=80=99ve developed a few key principles to help new sk=
ip leads better understand and perform their role. If you are a new skip le=
ad or hope to be one soon, this is for you.
1. Recognize that you are in a different role
First, simply take a step back to recognize (and accept) that managing mana=
gers is a very different set of skills and responsibilities than directly m=
anaging ICs. Most people intuitively understand that the transition from IC=
 to line manager is a role change with a steep learning curve. But the noti=
on that the learning curve from line manager to manager of managers is just=
 as steep=E2=80=94if not steeper=E2=80=94is highly counterintuitive. After =
all, they are already =E2=80=9Cin management.=E2=80=9D Isn=E2=80=99t this j=
ust the same bag of tricks applied to a larger group?
Nope. Not even close.
It=E2=80=99s a very different responsibility set, because instead of direct=
ly working with ICs, who have all the context since they are doing the work=
 themselves, the role requires working through an abstraction layer=E2=80=
=94the line manager=E2=80=94and doing so across a half dozen or more manage=
rs. Any notion of staying on top of every piece of work goes out the window=
=2E Also blurred is the formerly clear=20=
division of responsibilities between I=
Cs as makers and managers as supporters, helpers, or coaches, because you n=
ow have the situation of managers reporting to other managers. And the abil=
ity to get unfiltered information straight from the IC on the ground? That=
=E2=80=99s gone too.
Sadly, the organizational and senior leadership failure to even recognize t=
he major role change is rampant. And as we know, wherever there is a major =
lack of self-awareness, mediocrity is sure to follow.
In my own org, I was so clear about the under-recognized nature of this pro=
blem that for years I insisted on personally signing off on each case of a =
line manager becoming a manager to other managers. Occasionally I would eve=
n set up a one-on-one with the new skip to set clear expectations about the=
 major change in role. It was perceived as overkill at times, but I knew th=
at if the new skip could start from self-awareness about the steep learning=
 curve for a new role, the entire org was already starting out ahead.
2. Conduct the API endpoint experiment
APIs are wonderful because they allow engineers to get tasks done by simply=
 relying on the interface and ignoring all the underlying complexity behind=
 it. The analogy can be applied to managing managers by engaging with the f=
ollowing thought experiment: =E2=80=9CIf I had zero access to any IC in my =
organization and could only push or pull information from my managers to ma=
ke decisions, how would I go about being effective?=E2=80=9D
This type of introspection is powerful in the same way as lifting heavy wei=
ghts at the gym or taking a cold plunge: doing something uncomfortable in a=
n unnatural environment produces growth. Most new skip leads who were until=
 recently line managers are most comfortable with dealing directly with ICs=
, getting detailed context from them and giving them direction. This provoc=
ative question forces them to grapple with how they=E2=80=99d create value =
when that core context-building and decisioning tool in their toolbox is go=
ne and only the managers directly reporting to them are available. Immediat=
ely it forces the new skip lead to confront a panoply of follow-up question=
s, like:
How do I help line managers spot problems on their team without talking to =
their ICs?
How do I help line managers deal with IC performance issues on their team i=
nstead of dealing with them myself?
When do I defer to the line manager=E2=80=99s judgment if it runs counter t=
o mine?
When do I insist that my point of view carries the day even though the mana=
ger has talked to all the ICs and has more firsthand information?
How do I review work coming out of a line manager=E2=80=99s team in a way t=
hat is additive or complementary to what the manager is already doing?
How do I give input early enough that a line manager can course correct bef=
ore it=E2=80=99s too late?
What are the areas that I fully delegate to my line managers and what are t=
he areas where I retain final sign-off, and why?
Running through this exercise has two key caveats. First, answering these q=
uestions at a level of instinctive competence takes years of practice. (But=
 I find that new skip leads who ask these questions accelerate their learni=
ng in their role.) And second, this is a thought experiment, to be taken se=
riously but not literally. In real life, skip leads should of course talk w=
ith their skip reports on a regular basis. But how they engage with their s=
kip reports and how that interplays with their direct reports can benefit f=
rom an exercise in extremes.
Let=E2=80=99s now consider how to interact with direct-report managers and =
their reports (i.e. skip reports) with the next principle.
3. Never undermine
At Square, I had recurring one-on-ones with dozens of skip reports, weekly =
office hours available for anyone in the 800-person org, and lots of ad hoc=
 conversations across the org over Slack and in person. If you are a new sk=
ip lead, this should be common practice for you too.
These conversations are extremely valuable because they provide unfiltered =
feedback that your direct-report managers may have missed or even intention=
ally filtered out. They also provide a crucial source of context on how wel=
l your direct-report managers are doing.
But these conversations are also risky. The natural instinct for new skip l=
eaders is to offer strong opinions, solve problems, and make decisions on t=
he spot without getting full context from anyone else in the management cha=
in. This feels efficient! It may even feel like engaging in =E2=80=9Cfounde=
r mode.=E2=80=9D
But in general, off-the-cuff solutions and strong opinions actually undermi=
ne your direct-report managers in the management chain and disempower them =
in front of their own team. You rob your direct-report managers of the oppo=
rtunity to get your coaching on how to handle specific situations, learn yo=
ur line of reasoning, understand your context=E2=80=94and then apply all of=
 this themselves with their team in an ongoing and scalable way. In additio=
n to undermining the direct-report manager, you can easily confuse the skip=
 report with contradictory directions between you and their direct manager.=
 Jeff Weiner, the former CEO of LinkedIn, articulated this problem in a gre=
at essay [ https://substack.com/redirect/a6844d1c-4660-42cc-b917-44c55ba079=
f9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] on=
 the topic: =E2=80=9CYears ago, a former direct report of mine helped bring=
 this point home. While he and his team welcomed my input, he observed that=
 oftentimes what I thought was a take-it-or-leave-it remark would create a =
massively disruptive fire drill. Up until that moment, I had no idea my opi=
nion was being weighted so heavily.=E2=80=9D
The far better option, instead, is to listen carefully, ask lots of follow-=
up questions, and then actively work with your direct-report manager to do =
all the follow-up and actual direction-setting.
None of the above is in conflict with the recent exhortations to founder CE=
Os to engage in founder mode. Founder mode, done well, results in the found=
ing CEO staying highly engaged and hands-on while also coaching and empower=
ing the management chain. Founder mode done poorly is simply a recipe for u=
ndermining, disempowering, and creating chaos.
4. Never cover
The flip side of undermining your direct-report managers as a new skip lead=
 is covering for your direct-report manager=E2=80=99s underperformance with=
 your own bosses. Consider the following visual, which will feel very commo=
n to any PM who has worked in a large organization.
Even though the skip leader subconsciously (or even explicitly) knows that =
the line manager is struggling, confronting the issue head-on is hard=E2=80=
=94especially as a new skip. So the natural inclination is to quietly solve=
 the issue themselves, pull double duty by taking on part of the line manag=
er=E2=80=99s job, and then provide cover for the direct-report manager=E2=
=80=99s performance with others.
In fast-growing tech companies, this happens often. I=E2=80=99ve lost track=
 of the number of times I=E2=80=99ve sifted through the wreckage of a proje=
ct gone sideways and found exactly this issue. But the instinct to cover fo=
r bad news is deeply rooted in human emotions like shame and embarrassment =
of failure, fear of confrontation, and insecurity.
The better approach for the new skip leader is to (1) clearly report the un=
derperformance and a plan to course correct up the management chain, (2) so=
licit feedback on the course correction from leaders up the management chai=
n, and (3) set clear performance expectations with the direct-report manage=
r.
5. Use task-relevant maturity (TRM) to delegate and review work
As we see from the principles so far, skip leads can be most successful whe=
n they learn how to get the most out of their direct-report managers. Broad=
ly speaking, this is about delegating responsibilities across direct-report=
 managers to maximize the output of the overall team. Sounds simple enough,=
 right?
But in practice, delegating well is very difficult. In most high-growth tec=
hnology companies, the skip leader navigates a constantly changing landscap=
e. Every few weeks, new projects are planned. A previously planned project =
that is now underway goes off the rails when engineers find unexpected prob=
lems. A large customer complains loudly to senior leadership, resulting in =
a fire drill. A senior IC in the midst of a critical project threatens to q=
uit. An engineer and a designer get into a heated argument over a prototype=
=2E A sudden regulatory change threaten=
s an upcoming country launch. As you c=
an see, each of these projects=E2=80=94and the situations that surround the=
m=E2=80=94varies widely in the level of effort and time required, the level=
 of ambiguity and technical complexity, the number of teams involved, and p=
otential impact to the company.
To further complicate matters, projects and situations are only one half of=
 the ledger. The skip lead also has to figure out which of their direct-rep=
ort managers is best suited to take them on, because just as every project =
or situation is different, so is every line manager..
In any skip leader=E2=80=99s organization, line managers will vary widely i=
n skill level, institutional knowledge, emotional maturity, ability to hand=
le ambiguity, and other unique strengths and weaknesses. In product develop=
ment, managers may even specialize in engineering sub-disciplines, like mob=
ile, and PM leads may specialize in domains like developer tools or consume=
r social media. Just as every project or situation is different, so is ever=
y line manager.
Delegating well is so difficult because it requires constant matchmaking be=
tween a variety of projects and a variety of people in an ever-changing env=
ironment.
Thankfully, Andy Grove=E2=80=99s classic High Output Management [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/f8d1387a-8648-40e6-8ac0-289611dfd447?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=
TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] gives us a key managem=
ent concept framework for this kind of matchmaking: task-relevant maturity =
(TRM). Task-relevant maturity asks skip leads to evaluate the particulars o=
f each project or situation=E2=80=94its scope, size, risk, duration, ambigu=
ity, and so on=E2=80=94and then consider which manager is best suited based=
 on their skills and experience (specifically for that project or situation=
).
When a project or situation arises, the skip leader can ask questions to de=
termine which manager would be the best match for it:
Which of my managers has dealt with a very similar project before?
Which of my managers has the right level of technical skill required by thi=
s situation?
Which of my managers has asked me to be stretched into a project like this?
Which of my managers is senior enough to deal with a high degree of ambigui=
ty?
Which of my managers do I trust the most with this very delicate interperso=
nal situation?
Which of my managers is best suited for a mobile-heavy project?
Which of my managers can do this if I personally lean in a bit more than us=
ual?
Who can I hand this off to such that I can have this off my plate altogethe=
r?
Skip leads who are elite at delegation continually filter projects, situati=
ons, and people through the lens of task-relevant-maturity to maximize team=
 output and velocity.
But delegation is only the first critical step. As Andy Grove reminds us in=
 the book, delegation does not mean abdicating responsibility. It is still =
the skip leader=E2=80=99s job to ensure that they deeply review work on an =
ongoing basis=E2=80=94and micromanage when necessary=E2=80=94to keep things=
 on track. Ultimately, the buck stops with the skip leader.
This 2-by-2 rubric can help skip leaders with post-delegation review across=
 two key dimensions: uncertainty and impact. By clearly articulating the un=
certainty of a project (e.g. a new 0-to-1 product offering, which by defini=
tion is highly uncertain) and the project=E2=80=99s impact (e.g. a key laun=
ch in the core product that can make or break the financial plan), skips ca=
n easily adapt their own review cadence after they initially delegate the p=
roject to a line manager.
For example, a project with low impact and low uncertainty can be easily de=
legated to a newer line manager and =E2=80=9Cforgotten=E2=80=9D about. But =
a project with high impact and high uncertainty should be assigned to someo=
ne much more capable (i.e. with high TRM for the situation) and reviewed cl=
osely and continually.
A common category of high-uncertainty, high-impact project involves multipl=
e teams working together, cutting across line managers and maybe even acros=
s skip leads. Given the inherent difficulties of inter-team communication, =
competing priorities across teams as well as the number of line managers in=
volved, it is the skip leader=E2=80=99s responsibility to continually revie=
w work after delegating to find problems as early as possible=E2=80=94and f=
ix them.
In closing
A new manager of managers can start to apply these five principles in their=
 first week in the role, and hopefully for years after. It starts with reco=
gnizing the change in role and the steep learning curve. If new skip leads =
use cognitive hacks to focus attention, are careful about interactions with=
 ICs and the accidental impact on line managers, deeply understand task-rel=
evant maturity, and use inconsistency as a signal to resolve conflicts, the=
y can become experts at managing managers over time.
But if you are new to this role, I hope you will also give yourself the gra=
ce of patience. Getting to elite status is hard and takes many years. After=
 over a decade of managing managers, I=E2=80=99m still learning, improving,=
 and refining my pattern-matching instincts. You will too. And maybe, in a =
few years, when you get that prototypical complaint from a friend, you too =
will ask, =E2=80=9CWho=E2=80=99s the skip?=E2=80=9D

 Andy Grove reminds us in the book, delegation does not mean abdicating res=

deeply review work on an ongoing basis=E2=80=94and micromanage when necessa=
ry=E2=80=94to keep things on track. Ultimately, the buck stops with the ski=
p leader.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This 2-by-2 rubric can help skip leaders with pos=
t-delegation review across two key dimensions: uncertainty and impact. By c=
learly articulating the uncertainty of a project (e.g. a new 0-to-1 product=
 offering, which by definition is highly uncertain) and the project=E2=80=
=99s impact (e.g. a key launch in the core product that can make or break t=
he financial plan), skips can easily adapt their own review cadence after t=
hey initially delegate the project to a line manager.</p><div class=3D"capt=
