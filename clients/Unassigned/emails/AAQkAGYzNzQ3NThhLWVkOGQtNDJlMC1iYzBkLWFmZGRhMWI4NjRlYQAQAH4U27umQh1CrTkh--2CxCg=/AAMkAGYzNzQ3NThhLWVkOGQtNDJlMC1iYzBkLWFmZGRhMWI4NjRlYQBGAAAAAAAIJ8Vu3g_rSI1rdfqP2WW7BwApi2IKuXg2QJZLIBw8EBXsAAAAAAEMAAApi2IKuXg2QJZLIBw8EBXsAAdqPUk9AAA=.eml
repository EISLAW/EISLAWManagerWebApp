GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
TURKEY'S TIME TO RISE [4]
Aug. 4, 2025
_Question: Under its current leadership, Turkey is in decline and may soon disintegrate, potentially transforming into an Islamic republic similar to Iran. The economy is in deep crisis, and there is
virtually no freedom of any kind. North Korea-style governance is becoming the norm, with people thrown into jail without charge and held for months or even years. Turkey is steadily resembling
authoritarian regimes like Russia or North Korea. Don’t these developments make it impossible for Turkey to take advantage of a geopolitical opportunity and pose serious risks to U.S. interests in
the region?_
Response: I agree with much of this, save for the conclusion. Before Mao Zedong died in 1976, many dismissed the possibility of China emerging as a great power, with many of the same points made here
about Turkey. It was a reasonable argument at the time, but what many failed to understand was that, despite internal tyranny and tension with both great powers at the time (the United States and the
Soviet Union), China had the potential to grow. Many also failed to understand China’s economic and military potential. It is essential not to be fixated on the current situation in any country, but
rather to look at its potential and what keeps it from reaching its promise. In China, it was Mao’s ideology and his political stance, as well as the country’s general isolation from the world.
The perception was that this situation was China’s natural condition. But this view misunderstood China’s potential and its limitations.
I take the same position on Turkey. Turkey suffered from a terrible geopolitical position. On one side, it was faced by a hostile Soviet Union; on the other side, NATO was unable to extend its power
to defend Turkey, the United States used Turkey as a base but did not heavily invest in it, and the Arab and Persian worlds were locked in place and hostile to Turkey. That situation has collapsed.
First, Russia is no longer a threat. Second, the Arab world is in chaos, and the Turkish military is the most significant force on its boundary. Russia's current condition creates massive
opportunities for Turkey. Among them is a Saudi Arabia that is enormously rich and militarily weak, terrified of Islamic extremists and eager for a relationship with Turkey.
In addition, many countries with oppressive regimes become significant powers. The Turkish economy will evolve, as economies do, as will the political system, as Turkey is a very powerful country by
regional standards with a substantial military. While you are right about Turkey’s recent condition to some extent, nations can be locked into difficult positions and evolve politically,
economically and militarily as the old reality collapses and a new one emerges. So from my point of view, Turkey’s potential and its new strategic position release it from its old limits, as Mao’s
death and the subsequent reconstruction did for China.
-------------------------
OTHER QUESTIONS
_Question: Can you elaborate on the pushback Israel is facing at home and abroad? The statement that Israel is “reeling” from crises at home and abroad seems a bit strong. Crises are normal for
Israel, and Israel’s actions against Syria, Hezbollah and Iran were successful._
Answer: In every war in Israeli history, the Israeli public has been unified in supporting the government. This is the first war in which there has been a powerful antiwar movement, as well as a
powerful prowar movement. The polls show that Israel is deeply divided. One example of this is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to make a massive concession to Israel’s secularists. From
Israel’s founding, it was agreed that Orthodox Jews would not be drafted into the military. In Jewish culture, the study of the Torah and its tradition is the highest calling. But Netanyahu was
forced to do the unthinkable: draft Orthodox Jews. In addition, many reservists have quit, as they can do after a point. And the governing party rules through a coalition. Never in history was Israel
divided in such a way during wartime.
This is one dimension of what I meant by “reeling.” Another is the stunning shift in the position of a number of countries that had supported Israel since its founding. The decision by several
European countries and Canada to recognize a Palestinian state stunned Israelis, as these nations had always opposed an independent Palestinian state in the past. In addition, and this should not be
overlooked, Israel considers itself a Western country, and its citizens are deeply embedded in that culture. For them, the idea that many countries in which they did business or went to school view
Israel now as a rogue, genocidal state is shocking. The internal division and loss of standing in the West, coupled with the fact that this is the longest war in Israeli history, means to me that the
country is reeling. This is a fundamental crisis in multiple ways for Israel.
-------------------------
_Question: Can social-political history be described as following a “sine curve” plot? If so, do you think the U.S. is currently ascending or descending? And are we above or below the line?_
Response: Since it has been a while since my high school math days, I will answer only that the U.S. is following its historic pattern of 50-year social and economic crises and 80-year institutional
cycles. They have nearly converged only once prior, around Roosevelt’s election. In addition, Roosevelt didn’t have a geopolitical crisis until the U.S. joined World War II in 1941, years after
the Great Depression started. For Donald Trump, both cycles hit together with the imperative to reconstruct the federal government during the institutional cycle and radically rearrange the social and
economic systems, along with a non-cyclable geopolitical crisis, making the storm the most intense possible. But the United States has always followed a storm with a prosperous calm. I see this period
as part of a routine American process. To reinvent the system, the old system must be destroyed. I would argue we would be in this crisis with any president. In history, Trump’s political model will
matter less than the cycle itself.
-------------------------
_Question: Why do you never address global warming given the fact that all experts are talking and writing about it and that the weather is changing so much? Why isn’t it integrated into your
geopolitics?_
Response: My main reason for not addressing it is that I am not personally competent to determine the truth or consequences of it. But it goes deeper than that. I grew up with the dread of the
population explosion, which many believed could lead to mass starvation and death. Experts in the field and from the United Nations promoted this view, and to question it meant social ostracism. There
were calls for legally prosecuting women who had more than one child and so on. But the experts, and all those who believed them, were proved wrong. When I look at global warming and the consensus
that has formed around it, driven by experts in the field, I am always reminded of the population bomb – a concept that was equally widely and passionately accepted.
So I am cautious with things I don’t know about, and by experience, I am cynical about expert consensus. I am far more respectful of issues on which there is intense disagreement between experts and
within the public domain. Since I do not have the knowledge to form an opinion of my own on the subject, and since my opinion does not and should not matter, I avoid taking positions one way or
another on issues on which there is widespread agreement among experts. Such consensus frequently means that PhD candidates who challenged it never got their degrees, as was the case with people who
challenged the data on the population explosion. So I honestly have no opinion on global warming, because I lack the ability to judge for myself, I don’t have the knowledge to form an opinion, and I
am neurotically suspicious of anything that experts all agree on. Perhaps not a good reason for avoiding the subject, but this is why I don’t comment on it.
I should add, however, that I have looked into whether the current weather is unprecedented, and for the most part, it’s not. Even having the worst wildfires in 80 years means they happened before.
On the other hand, it is darned hot this summer.
To emphasize, I neither reject nor believe in global warming. I do not have the knowledge to have an opinion, nor do I automatically trust expert opinions. In my profession, I have made my way by
being aware of expert opinions but having the discipline to be indifferent to their opinions of me, my analysis and my forecasts. Whatever small success I might have had is based on my disciplined
indifference and acceptance of being alone in my views, which tend to differ from those of other experts. I work with what I am confident of, and do not trust expert consensus. It’s not my style.

with much of this, save for the conclusion. Before Mao Zedong died in 1976,=
 many dismissed the possibility of China emerging as a great power, with ma=
ny of the same points made here about Turkey. It was a reasonable argument =
at the time, but what many failed to understand was that, despite internal =
tyranny and tension with both great powers at the time (the United States a=
nd the Soviet Union), China had the potential to grow. Many also failed to =
understand China=E2=80=99s economic and military potential. It is essential=
 not to be fixated on the current situation in any country, but rather to l=
ook at its potential and what keeps it from reaching its promise. In China,=
 it was Mao=E2=80=99s ideology and his political stance, as well as the cou=
ntry=E2=80=99s general isolation from the world. The perception was that th=
is situation was China=E2=80=99s natural condition. But this view misunders=
tood China=E2=80=99s potential and its limitations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I take the same po=
sition on Turkey. Turkey suffered from a terrible geopolitical position. On=
 one side, it was faced by a hostile Soviet Union; on the other side, NATO =
was unable to extend its power to defend Turkey, the United States used Tur=
key as a base but did not heavily invest in it, and the Arab and Persian wo=
rlds were locked in place and hostile to Turkey. That situation has collaps=
ed. First, Russia is no longer a threat. Second, the Arab world is in chaos=
, and the Turkish military is the most significant force on its boundary. R=
ussia's current condition creates massive opportunities for Turkey. Among t=
hem is a Saudi Arabia that is enormously rich and militarily weak, terrifie=
d of Islamic extremists and eager for a relationship with Turkey.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In addition, many =
countries with oppressive regimes become significant powers. The Turkish ec=
onomy will evolve, as economies do, as will the political system, as Turkey=
 is a very powerful country by regional standards with a substantial milita=
ry. While you are right about Turkey=E2=80=99s recent condition to some ext=
ent, nations can be locked into difficult positions and evolve politically,=
 economically and militarily as the old reality collapses and a new one eme=
rges. So from my point of view, Turkey=E2=80=99s potential and its new stra=
tegic position release it from its old limits, as Mao=E2=80=99s death and t=
he subsequent reconstruction did for China.</p>

tions</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Can =
you elaborate on the pushback Israel is facing at home and abroad? The stat=
ement that Israel is =E2=80=9Creeling=E2=80=9D from crises at home and abro=
ad seems a bit strong. Crises are normal for Israel, and Israel=E2=80=99s a=
ctions against Syria, Hezbollah and Iran were successful.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Answer: In every w=
ar in Israeli history, the Israeli public has been unified in supporting th=
e government. This is the first war in which there has been a powerful anti=
war movement, as well as a powerful prowar movement. The polls show that Is=
rael is deeply divided. One example of this is that Prime Minister Benjamin=
 Netanyahu had to make a massive concession to Israel=E2=80=99s secularists=
. From Israel=E2=80=99s founding, it was agreed that Orthodox Jews would no=
t be drafted into the military. In Jewish culture, the study of the Torah a=
nd its tradition is the highest calling. But Netanyahu was forced to do the=
 unthinkable: draft Orthodox Jews. In addition, many reservists have quit, =
as they can do after a point. And the governing party rules through a coali=
tion. Never in history was Israel divided in such a way during wartime.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This is one dimens=
ion of what I meant by =E2=80=9Creeling.=E2=80=9D Another is the stunning s=
hift in the position of a number of countries that had supported Israel sin=
ce its founding. The decision by several European countries and Canada to r=
ecognize a Palestinian state stunned Israelis, as these nations had always =
opposed an independent Palestinian state in the past. In addition, and this=
 should not be overlooked, Israel considers itself a Western country, and i=
ts citizens are deeply embedded in that culture. For them, the idea that ma=
ny countries in which they did business or went to school view Israel now a=
s a rogue, genocidal state is shocking. The internal division and loss of s=
tanding in the West, coupled with the fact that this is the longest war in =
Israeli history, means to me that the country is reeling. This is a fundame=
ntal crisis in multiple ways for Israel.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Can =
social-political history be described as following a =E2=80=9Csine curve=E2=
=80=9D plot? If so, do you think the U.S. is currently ascending or descend=
ing? And are we above or below the line?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Since it=
 has been a while since my high school math days, I will answer only that t=
he U.S. is following its historic pattern of 50-year social and economic cr=
ises and 80-year institutional cycles. They have nearly converged only once=
 prior, around Roosevelt=E2=80=99s election. In addition, Roosevelt didn=E2=
=80=99t have a geopolitical crisis until the U.S. joined World War II in 19=
41, years after the Great Depression started. For Donald Trump, both cycles=
 hit together with the imperative to reconstruct the federal government dur=
ing the institutional cycle and radically rearrange the social and economic=
 systems, along with a non-cyclable geopolitical crisis, making the storm t=
he most intense possible. But the United States has always followed a storm=
 with a prosperous calm. I see this period as part of a routine American pr=
ocess. To reinvent the system, the old system must be destroyed. I would ar=
gue we would be in this crisis with any president. In history, Trump=E2=80=
=99s political model will matter less than the cycle itself.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Why =
do you never address global warming given the fact that all experts are tal=
king and writing about it and that the weather is changing so much? Why isn=
=E2=80=99t it integrated into your geopolitics?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: My main =
reason for not addressing it is that I am not personally competent to deter=
mine the truth or consequences of it. But it goes deeper than that. I grew =
up with the dread of the population explosion, which many believed could le=
ad to mass starvation and death. Experts in the field and from the United N=
ations promoted this view, and to question it meant social ostracism. There=
 were calls for legally prosecuting women who had more than one child and s=
o on. But the experts, and all those who believed them, were proved wrong. =
When I look at global warming and the consensus that has formed around it, =
driven by experts in the field, I am always reminded of the population bomb=
 =E2=80=93 a concept that was equally widely and passionately accepted.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">So I am cautious w=
ith things I don=E2=80=99t know about, and by experience, I am cynical abou=
t expert consensus. I am far more respectful of issues on which there is in=
tense disagreement between experts and within the public domain. Since I do=
 not have the knowledge to form an opinion of my own on the subject, and si=
nce my opinion does not and should not matter, I avoid taking positions one=
 way or another on issues on which there is widespread agreement among expe=
rts. Such consensus frequently means that PhD candidates who challenged it =
never got their degrees, as was the case with people who challenged the dat=
a on the population explosion. So I honestly have no opinion on global warm=
ing, because I lack the ability to judge for myself, I don=E2=80=99t have t=
he knowledge to form an opinion, and I am neurotically suspicious of anythi=
ng that experts all agree on. Perhaps not a good reason for avoiding the su=
bject, but this is why I don=E2=80=99t comment on it.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I should add, howe=
ver, that I have looked into whether the current weather is unprecedented, =
and for the most part, it=E2=80=99s not. Even having the worst wildfires in=
 80 years means they happened before. On the other hand, it is darned hot t=
his summer.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To emphasize, I ne=
ither reject nor believe in global warming. I do not have the knowledge to =
have an opinion, nor do I automatically trust expert opinions. In my profes=
sion, I have made my way by being aware of expert opinions but having the d=
iscipline to be indifferent to their opinions of me, my analysis and my for=
ecasts. Whatever small success I might have had is based on my disciplined =
indifference and acceptance of being alone in my views, which tend to diffe=
r from those of other experts. I work with what I am confident of, and do n=
ot trust expert consensus. It=E2=80=99s not my style.</p>
