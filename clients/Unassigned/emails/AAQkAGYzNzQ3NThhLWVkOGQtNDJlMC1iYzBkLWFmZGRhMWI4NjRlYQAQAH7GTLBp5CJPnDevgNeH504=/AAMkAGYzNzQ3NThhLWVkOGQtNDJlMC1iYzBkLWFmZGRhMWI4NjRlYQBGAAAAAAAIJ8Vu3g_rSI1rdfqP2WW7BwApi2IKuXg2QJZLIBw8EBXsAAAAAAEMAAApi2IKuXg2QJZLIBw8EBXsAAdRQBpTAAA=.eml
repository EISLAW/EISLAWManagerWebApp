BELARUS’ FOREIGN POLICY RETURNS TO AN OLD PLAYBOOK [3]
MINSK’S GREATEST STRENGTH IS PLAYING TWO SIDES AGAINST EACH OTHER.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
At the annual Eurasian Economic Forum hosted in Minsk last week, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said his country’s foreign policy would prioritize building a mutually beneficial model of
cooperation with all states. Belarus’ deputy prime minister echoed the sentiment, saying contacts between the post-Soviet states of the Eurasian Economic Union and third countries were a positive
trend. Just a few days earlier, U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg arrived in Belarus to meet with Lukashenko. After the visit, Minsk announced it was releasing 14 political prisoners. In exchange, the
U.S. is expected to ease sanctions against Belarusian banks and potash exports.
Though Moscow did not react directly to the engagement, Russia experts took notice of a post by Kellogg on X in which he referred to Lukashenko as the leader of Belarus, despite the United States’
official refusal since 2020 to recognize him as the legitimate president of the country. In addition, Lukashenko sent a message this week to Canadians to mark Canada Day, saying “soon both countries
will resume their relations and full-scale cooperation, based on common interests of their peoples.”
These recent developments could be initial indicators of Belarus’ return to a policy of balancing between East and West. While this posture previously irritated its closest ally in Moscow, the
Kremlin could have an interest in supporting the rapprochement this time around.
NO EASY TASK
Until Belarus’ controversial presidential election and subsequent mass protests in 2020, Belarus followed a long-cultivated policy of balancing its diplomatic and economic ties with parties that
often didn’t see eye to eye. After gaining independence, it sought to avoid isolation within a still Russia-dominated Eurasia. It maintained close economic relations with Russia, which accounted for
at least half its imports and exports, but also expanded trade with neighboring Poland, Lithuania and Latvia (all of which later joined the European Union), as well as Ukraine and Western Europe. It
was a great move for Belarus, which used its location between Eastern and Western markets to evolve into a transport hub, including notably for energy through the Druzhba oil pipeline and the
Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. Russia, Kazakhstan and later China grew to rely on Belarus as a key intermediary to deliver their exports to Europe, and vice versa. Between 2014 and 2021, container
shipments between Europe and China via Belarus increased 14-fold. U.S. investments in Belarus rose, and U.S. businesses entered the Belarusian market, though their presence was considered more a
strategic step than a serious commercial success given the country’s limited economic resources. By 2018, there were 181 companies with U.S. capital operating in Belarus, with investments totaling
$70 million.
Managing these relationships hasn’t been easy, in part due to the Belarusian president’s own desire to stay in power – which at times has been the main driver of the country’s diplomatic
agenda, ahead of even economic concerns. After an initial period of warming, U.S.-Belarus relations have been deteriorating since the latter half of the 2000s. Both the United States and the European
Union imposed sanctions against Belarusian officials over their roles in suppressing opposition protests following the 2010 presidential election, which was declared for Lukashenko, who has been
president since 1994. Washington and Brussels also accused Lukashenko and his government of human rights violations and election fixing. These tensions ultimately drew Minsk only closer to Moscow.
Still, Belarus continued to pursue trade with Europe, to the benefit of all sides. Tensions between Minsk and Western governments eased after 2014, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea. At that
point, the West prioritized Belarus’ role as a buffer against Russia, which appeared more intent than ever on reviving the Soviet Union. However, the 2020 Belarusian presidential election derailed
this warming of relations. Lukashenko was again declared the winner, but the Belarusian opposition said the vote was rigged, and Western governments agreed. Opposition-led protests ensued, forcing
Lukashenko to turn to Moscow for support. It obliged, helping Lukashenko cling to power for yet another term. (He was elected to a seventh term earlier this year.) Moscow, after all, had its own
interests in seeing a pro-Kremlin leader remain president, especially at a time when Lukashenko was being increasingly courted by the West. The U.S. and the EU subsequently imposed more sanctions on
Belarusian officials and economic sectors, and refused to recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate president, cementing his loyalty to the Kremlin and Belarus’ position as Russia’s closest partner.
OPEN DOOR
However, Belarus has been careful not to fully close the door on relations with Europe. Though it has supported Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarusian troops have not joined the
military campaign. It also moved the Zapad joint military exercises with Russia set for later this year deeper into Belarusian territory and farther away from its borders with NATO countries. The
Belarusian defense minister said the move was a demonstration of Minsk’s readiness for dialogue. Despite the sanctions, Belarus and the European Union managed to maintain trade turnover totaling $8
billion in 2024. The government also recently lifted a ban on the import and sale of certain produce items from “unfriendly” countries, including EU member states. All this points to Minsk’s
continued balancing efforts.
The failure to reach an agreement on the Russia-Ukraine war after a series of U.S.-Russia meetings is reason to believe that the West could revive its interest in Belarus as a tool to increase
pressure on the Kremlin. Minsk also seems interested in mending ties. It has repeatedly offered to host peace negotiations, having previously acted as a mediator in ceasefire talks over the conflict
in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014. Lukashenko even conveyed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position on a possible settlement to U.S. officials during his recent talks with the U.S. special
envoy. This limited interaction therefore could be a good litmus test for future U.S. and EU engagement with Russia.

Moscow, meanwhile, doesn’t seem worried. In fact, it could even support a warming of relations between Belarus and the West, believing that Minsk is too deep in its orbit to ever fully dig its way
out. Their economic ties over the past three years have only deepened due to the sanctions campaign and their subsequent isolation. Trade turnover between the two countries increased to a record $51.8
billion in 2024. Russia now accounts for up to 70 percent of Belarus’ total trade, and they conduct trade entirely in their own national currencies.
Economically, Russia would stand to benefit if Western governments were willing to reopen their economies to Belarus. There have been suggestions that the U.S. could ease sanctions on Minsk.
Considering their customs union, such a development could help Russian goods reenter Western markets and give a boost to the Russian economy.
On the political front, Belarus’ interests are clearly more aligned with those of Russia. Lukashenko remains dependent on the Kremlin’s support to stay in power, while the West continues to side
with the opposition. Moscow has also helped engage Belarus with the Global South. China, for example, is increasingly a key trade partner for Belarus. Russia is also exploring the possibility of
allowing landlocked Belarus to construct its own terminals in the Kaliningrad and Murmansk regions. (Russia could face competition here, however, as rumors online suggested the U.S. was considering
allowing Belarus to restore its access to ports in Lithuania and Latvia. Moscow, however, could take advantage of this endeavor, too, using these ports to deliver sanctioned Russian energy to European
markets.)
Like Moscow, Minsk is concerned about NATO enlargement, as well as the ongoing conflict along its southern border. It thus needs an ally to help manage these threats and guarantee its security.
Belarusian authorities have reported Ukrainian drones flying over their shared border almost weekly. Belarus’ State Border Committee recently said it would increase security along the southern
border due to the “tense” situation there, with plans to set up six new units, military towns and border outposts this year. Minsk also indicated that it is developing unmanned aircraft and
counter-drone systems. It will deploy Russia’s Oreshnik missile system on Belarusian territory by the end of 2025.
For the West, Belarus remains a tool to influence an intractable Moscow. It’s critical that Russia maintain the loyalty of its few remaining security partners and a dependable buffer to the West.
Minsk has been willing to comply in recent years, but balancing will be a growing priority going forward. Its strength, after all, has always lied in maintaining relationships with countries on
opposing sides of a global power struggle.

s were a positive trend. Just a few days earlier, U.S. special envoy Keith =
Kellogg arrived in Belarus to meet with Lukashenko. After the visit, Minsk =
announced it was releasing 14 political prisoners. In exchange, the U.S. is=
 expected to ease sanctions against Belarusian banks and potash exports.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Though Moscow did =
not react directly to the engagement, Russia experts took notice of a post =
by Kellogg on X in which he referred to Lukashenko as the leader of Belarus=
, despite the United States=E2=80=99 official refusal since 2020 to recogni=
ze him as the legitimate president of the country. In addition, Lukashenko =
sent a message this week to Canadians to mark Canada Day, saying =E2=80=9Cs=
oon both countries will resume their relations and full-scale cooperation, =
based on common interests of their peoples.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These recent devel=
opments could be initial indicators of Belarus=E2=80=99 return to a policy =
of balancing between East and West. While this posture previously irritated=
 its closest ally in Moscow, the Kremlin could have an interest in supporti=
ng the rapprochement this time around.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>No Easy Ta=
sk</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Until Belarus=E2=
=80=99 controversial presidential election and subsequent mass protests in =
2020, Belarus followed a long-cultivated policy of balancing its diplomatic=
 and economic ties with parties that often didn=E2=80=99t see eye to eye. A=
fter gaining independence, it sought to avoid isolation within a still Russ=
ia-dominated Eurasia. It maintained close economic relations with Russia, w=
hich accounted for at least half its imports and exports, but also expanded=
 trade with neighboring Poland, Lithuania and Latvia (all of which later jo=
ined the European Union), as well as Ukraine and Western Europe. It was a g=
reat move for Belarus, which used its location between Eastern and Western =
markets to evolve into a transport hub, including notably for energy throug=
h the Druzhba oil pipeline and the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. Russia, Kazak=
hstan and later China grew to rely on Belarus as a key intermediary to deli=
ver their exports to Europe, and vice versa. Between 2014 and 2021, contain=
er shipments between Europe and China via Belarus increased 14-fold. U.S. i=
nvestments in Belarus rose, and U.S. businesses entered the Belarusian mark=
et, though their presence was considered more a strategic step than a serio=
us commercial success given the country=E2=80=99s limited economic resource=
s. By 2018, there were 181 companies with U.S. capital operating in Belarus=
, with investments totaling $70 million.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Managing these rel=
ationships hasn=E2=80=99t been easy, in part due to the Belarusian presiden=
t=E2=80=99s own desire to stay in power =E2=80=93 which at times has been t=
he main driver of the country=E2=80=99s diplomatic agenda, ahead of even ec=
onomic concerns. After an initial period of warming, U.S.-Belarus relations=
 have been deteriorating since the latter half of the 2000s. Both the Unite=
d States and the European Union imposed sanctions against Belarusian offici=
als over their roles in suppressing opposition protests following the 2010 =
presidential election, which was declared for Lukashenko, who has been pres=
ident since 1994. Washington and Brussels also accused Lukashenko and his g=
overnment of human rights violations and election fixing. These tensions ul=
timately drew Minsk only closer to Moscow.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Still, Belarus con=
tinued to pursue trade with Europe, to the benefit of all sides. Tensions b=
etween Minsk and Western governments eased after 2014, following Russia=E2=
=80=99s annexation of Crimea. At that point, the West prioritized Belarus=
=E2=80=99 role as a buffer against Russia, which appeared more intent than =
ever on reviving the Soviet Union. However, the 2020 Belarusian presidentia=
l election derailed this warming of relations. Lukashenko was again declare=
d the winner, but the Belarusian opposition said the vote was rigged, and W=
estern governments agreed. Opposition-led protests ensued, forcing Lukashen=
ko to turn to Moscow for support. It obliged, helping Lukashenko cling to p=
ower for yet another term. (He was elected to a seventh term earlier this y=
ear.) Moscow, after all, had its own interests in seeing a pro-Kremlin lead=
er remain president, especially at a time when Lukashenko was being increas=
ingly courted by the West. The U.S. and the EU subsequently imposed more sa=
nctions on Belarusian officials and economic sectors, and refused to recogn=
ize Lukashenko as the legitimate president, cementing his loyalty to the Kr=
emlin and Belarus=E2=80=99 position as Russia=E2=80=99s closest partner.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Open Door<=
/strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, Belarus h=
as been careful not to fully close the door on relations with Europe. Thoug=
h it has supported Russia=E2=80=99s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus=
ian troops have not joined the military campaign. It also moved the Zapad j=
oint military exercises with Russia set for later this year deeper into Bel=
arusian territory and farther away from its borders with NATO countries. Th=
e Belarusian defense minister said the move was a demonstration of Minsk=E2=
=80=99s readiness for dialogue. Despite the sanctions, Belarus and the Euro=
pean Union managed to maintain trade turnover totaling $8 billion in 2024. =
The government also recently lifted a ban on the import and sale of certain=
 produce items from =E2=80=9Cunfriendly=E2=80=9D countries, including EU me=
mber states. All this points to Minsk=E2=80=99s continued balancing efforts=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The failure to rea=
ch an agreement on the Russia-Ukraine war after a series of U.S.-Russia mee=
tings is reason to believe that the West could revive its interest in Belar=
us as a tool to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Minsk also seems interest=
ed in mending ties. It has repeatedly offered to host peace negotiations, h=
aving previously acted as a mediator in ceasefire talks over the conflict i=
n eastern Ukraine that began in 2014. Lukashenko even conveyed Russian Pres=
ident Vladimir Putin=E2=80=99s position on a possible settlement to U.S. of=
ficials during his recent talks with the U.S. special envoy. This limited i=
nteraction therefore could be a good litmus test for future U.S. and EU eng=
agement with Russia.</p>

/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Moscow, meanwhile,=
 doesn=E2=80=99t seem worried. In fact, it could even support a warming of =
relations between Belarus and the West, believing that Minsk is too deep in=
 its orbit to ever fully dig its way out. Their economic ties over the past=
 three years have only deepened due to the sanctions campaign and their sub=
sequent isolation. Trade turnover between the two countries increased to a =
record $51.8 billion in 2024. Russia now accounts for up to 70 percent of B=
elarus=E2=80=99 total trade, and they conduct trade entirely in their own n=
ational currencies.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Economically, Russ=
ia would stand to benefit if Western governments were willing to reopen the=
ir economies to Belarus. There have been suggestions that the U.S. could ea=
se sanctions on Minsk. Considering their customs union, such a development =
could help Russian goods reenter Western markets and give a boost to the Ru=
ssian economy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On the political f=
ront, Belarus=E2=80=99 interests are clearly more aligned with those of Rus=
sia. Lukashenko remains dependent on the Kremlin=E2=80=99s support to stay =
in power, while the West continues to side with the opposition. Moscow has =
also helped engage Belarus with the Global South. China, for example, is in=
creasingly a key trade partner for Belarus. Russia is also exploring the po=
ssibility of allowing landlocked Belarus to construct its own terminals in =
the Kaliningrad and Murmansk regions. (Russia could face competition here, =
however, as rumors online suggested the U.S. was considering allowing Belar=
us to restore its access to ports in Lithuania and Latvia. Moscow, however,=
 could take advantage of this endeavor, too, using these ports to deliver s=
anctioned Russian energy to European markets.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Like Moscow, Minsk=
 is concerned about NATO enlargement, as well as the ongoing conflict along=
 its southern border. It thus needs an ally to help manage these threats an=
d guarantee its security. Belarusian authorities have reported Ukrainian dr=
ones flying over their shared border almost weekly. Belarus=E2=80=99 State =
Border Committee recently said it would increase security along the souther=
n border due to the =E2=80=9Ctense=E2=80=9D situation there, with plans to =
set up six new units, military towns and border outposts this year. Minsk a=
lso indicated that it is developing unmanned aircraft and counter-drone sys=
tems. It will deploy Russia=E2=80=99s Oreshnik missile system on Belarusian=
 territory by the end of 2025.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For the West, Bela=
rus remains a tool to influence an intractable Moscow. It=E2=80=99s critica=
l that Russia maintain the loyalty of its few remaining security partners a=
nd a dependable buffer to the West. Minsk has been willing to comply in rec=
ent years, but balancing will be a growing priority going forward. Its stre=
ngth, after all, has always lied in maintaining relationships with countrie=
s on opposing sides of a global power struggle.</p>
