1. Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction
Watching: Test-Time Interaction (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5dc=
7604-93b5-424f-b1e3-540633978fb1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=

DnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Current AI agents are stuck in a "think first, =
act later" paradigm. When these agents encounter a task, they spend a lot o=
f computational resources generating long chains of reasoning before taking=
 any action - essentially overthinking before doing anything. This is like =
trying to plan your entire route through a maze before taking a single step=
=2E The fundamental limitation is that=20=
this approach prevents agents from lea=
rning new information through interaction with their environment. In real-w=
orld scenarios where conditions change or information is incomplete (think =
booking a flight where prices fluctuate or browsing a website where not all=
 content is immediately visible), these reactive agents struggle because th=
ey can't adapt their behavior based on what they discover along the way.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers propose "interaction scaling=
" - instead of =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D longer, agents should =E2=80=9Cac=
t=E2=80=9D more. For this purpose, they developed TTI (Test-Time Interactio=
n), a training method that uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Th=
e curriculum is clever: it starts by training agents with short interaction=
 sequences (like teaching a child simple tasks first) and gradually increas=
es the allowed number of steps. This is implemented using a multiplicative =
schedule that expands the interaction horizon from 10 to 30 steps over trai=
ning iterations. The agents learn through online filtered behavior cloning,=
 where only successful task completions are used for training. They tested =
this approach on web navigation tasks using a Gemma 3 12B model, creating a=
gents that can browse websites, fill forms, and search for information.
What are the key findings? They demonstrate that "doing more" beats "thinki=
ng more" when agents have a fixed computational budget. On WebArena benchma=
rks, simply prompting agents to "check again" after completing a task impro=
ved success rates from 23% to 28% - while forcing them to spend more time i=
n the reasoning phase only yielded a 3% improvement. The full TTI system ac=
hieved state-of-the-art performance among open-source agents, with 64.8% su=
ccess on WebVoyager and 26.1% on WebArena. Interestingly, TTI agents learne=
d to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation - they'd efficiently c=
omplete simple tasks but engage in backtracking and broader searches for co=
mplex ones. The trained agents actually reduced their per-step reasoning (s=
horter chain-of-thought) while taking more interaction steps, automatically=
 learning to trade thinking for doing.
Why does it matter? This fundamentally challenges how we approach AI agent =
development. Instead of building agents that are excellent armchair philoso=
phers, we need agents that learn by doing - much like humans do. This is pa=
rticularly important for real-world applications where environments are dyn=
amic and information is incomplete. Their work shows that interaction itsel=
f is a form of compute that can be scaled, opening new avenues for agent tr=
aining beyond just making models larger or their reasoning deeper. For prac=
tical applications like web automation, customer service, or robotic contro=
l, this means we can build agents that adapt in real-time rather than being=
 stuck with pre-planned behaviors. The approach also demonstrates a form of=
 self-improvement where agents learn from their own synthetic data, potenti=
ally reducing reliance on expensive human-annotated datasets.

2. Lingshu: A Generalist Foundation Model for Unified Multimodal Medical Un=
derstanding and Reasoning
Watching:  Lingshu (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/7903970c-88b9-470=
5-8114-40605a862b33?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6Rx=
Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code [ https://substack.com/redirect/cdfdc95f-8334-4591-bd27=
-51ef3f6a83d1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjM=
RMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? While Large Language Models like GPT-4 have bec=
ome remarkably capable at understanding everyday images and text, they stru=
ggle when it comes to medical applications. Think of it like asking a brill=
iant generalist to suddenly perform surgery - they might understand the con=
cepts, but lack the specialized expertise. Current medical MLLMs face three=
 major roadblocks: they mostly focus on medical images while ignoring the v=
ast wealth of medical text knowledge, they're prone to "hallucinating" (mak=
ing up plausible-sounding but incorrect medical information), and they lack=
 the sophisticated reasoning abilities that doctors use when making complex=
 diagnoses. This gap is particularly concerning given that medical AI needs=
 to be both comprehensive and reliable.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers developed Lingshu through a =
comprehensive data curation pipeline that goes beyond just collecting medic=
al images. They gathered medical knowledge from multiple sources - imaging =
data, extensive medical texts, and even general-domain data - then synthesi=
zed high-quality training examples including detailed medical captions, vis=
ual question-answering pairs, and chain-of-thought reasoning samples. The m=
odel undergoes multi-stage training that progressively builds medical exper=
tise, similar to how medical students progress from basic anatomy to comple=
x clinical reasoning. They also explored using reinforcement learning with =
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance the model's medical reasoning abilitie=
s. Additionally, they created MedEvalKit, a standardized evaluation framewo=
rk that consolidates various medical benchmarks for fair comparison.
What are the key findings? Lingshu consistently outperforms existing open-s=
ource multimodal models across most medical tasks evaluated. The model demo=
nstrates strong performance on three fundamental medical capabilities: mult=
imodal question answering (understanding and answering questions about medi=
cal images), text-based medical QA, and medical report generation. For inst=
ance, Lingshu-32B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average sco=
re of 66.6 across multimodal benchmarks, outperforming both proprietary and=
 open-source competitors. The researchers also conducted five real-world ca=
se studies showing Lingshu's practical utility in scenarios like medical di=
agnosis, radiology report generation, and patient consultations.
Why does it matter? By addressing the limitations of existing medical MLLMs=
 - particularly their narrow focus on images and susceptibility to errors -=
 Lingshu provides a more holistic and reliable foundation for medical AI ap=
plications. The comprehensive evaluation framework (MedEvalKit) is equally =
important as it establishes standardized benchmarks for the field, enabling=
 fair comparisons and driving future improvements. Most critically, the dem=
onstrated real-world applications suggest that such models could meaningful=
ly assist healthcare professionals in clinical practice, potentially improv=

What problem does it solve? Modern image generation systems like DALL-E or =
Stable Diffusion typically require two major components: a tokenizer that c=
ompresses images into a compact representation, and a separate generative m=
odel (like a diffusion model) that learns to create new images in this comp=
ressed space. Training these generative models is computationally expensive=
 and time-consuming. The authors investigate whether the tokenizer itself -=
 specifically highly compressed 1D tokenizers that squeeze entire images in=
to just 32 discrete tokens - might already possess generative capabilities =
without needing any additional model training. This is like asking whether =
a really good compression algorithm might inherently understand images well=
 enough to create new ones.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers took a pretrained TiTok 1D t=
okenizer and explored its capabilities through increasingly sophisticated e=
xperiments. First, they discovered that specific token positions correspond=
 to high-level image attributes (like lighting or blur), enabling simple "c=
opy-paste" operations between images' token representations to transfer the=
se attributes. Building on this insight, they developed a gradient-based op=
timization approach that directly manipulates tokens at test time using obj=
ectives like CLIP similarity (for text-guided editing) or reconstruction lo=
ss (for inpainting). This optimization doesn't require any training - it ju=
st iteratively adjusts the tokens to maximize the desired objective, simila=
r to how you might adjust sliders in photo editing software until the image=
 looks right.
What are the key findings? They demonstrate that highly compressed tokenize=
rs can indeed function as generative models without additional training. Th=
e authors achieved an FID score of 8.2 on ImageNet generation (lower is bet=
ter), competitive with methods that require extensive generative model trai=
ning. They found that higher compression ratios paradoxically lead to bette=
r generative performance - tokenizers producing just 32 tokens outperformed=
 those using 64 or 128 tokens. The system successfully performs text-guided=
 image editing, inpainting, and even generates images from scratch using on=
ly test-time optimization. Remarkably, simple token manipulations like copy=
ing tokens between images can reliably transfer appearance attributes like =
lighting conditions or background blur.
Why does it matter? Their findings suggest that extreme compression forces =
tokenizers to learn such rich, semantic representations that they become im=
plicit generative models - essentially learning not just how to compress im=
ages, but understanding what makes an image valid. This could dramatically =
reduce the computational resources needed for image generation, as it elimi=
nates the need to train separate generative models. The work also provides =
insights into the nature of visual representation learning: when you compre=
ss an image into just 32 tokens, each token must capture global, meaningful=
 information about the image, creating a latent space that's inherently sui=
table for generation and manipulation.

 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What problem does it solve?</strong><span> =
Current AI agents are stuck in a &quot;think first, act later&quot; paradig=
m. When these agents encounter a task, they spend a lot of computational re=
sources generating long chains of reasoning before taking any action - esse=
ntially overthinking before doing anything. This is like trying to plan you=
r entire route through a maze before taking a single step. The fundamental =
limitation is that this approach prevents agents from learning new informat=
ion through interaction with their environment. In real-world scenarios whe=
re conditions change or information is incomplete (think booking a flight w=
here prices fluctuate or browsing a website where not all content is immedi=
ately visible), these reactive agents struggle because they can't adapt the=
ir behavior based on what they discover along the way.</span></p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> The researchers =
propose &quot;interaction scaling&quot; - instead of =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=
=80=9D longer, agents should =E2=80=9Cact=E2=80=9D more. For this purpose, =
they developed TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a training method that uses cur=
riculum-based reinforcement learning. The curriculum is clever: it starts b=
y training agents with short interaction sequences (like teaching a child s=
imple tasks first) and gradually increases the allowed number of steps. Thi=
s is implemented using a multiplicative schedule that expands the interacti=
on horizon from 10 to 30 steps over training iterations. The agents learn t=
hrough online filtered behavior cloning, where only successful task complet=
ions are used for training. They tested this approach on web navigation tas=
ks using a Gemma 3 12B model, creating agents that can browse websites, fil=
l forms, and search for information.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What ar=
e the key findings? </strong><span>They demonstrate that &quot;doing more&q=
uot; beats &quot;thinking more&quot; when agents have a fixed computational=
 budget. On WebArena benchmarks, simply prompting agents to &quot;check aga=
in&quot; after completing a task improved success rates from 23% to 28% - w=
hile forcing them to spend more time in the reasoning phase only yielded a =
3% improvement. The full TTI system achieved state-of-the-art performance a=
mong open-source agents, with 64.8% success on WebVoyager and 26.1% on WebA=
rena. Interestingly, TTI agents learned to adaptively balance exploration a=
nd exploitation - they'd efficiently complete simple tasks but engage in ba=
cktracking and broader searches for complex ones. The trained agents actual=
ly reduced their per-step reasoning (shorter chain-of-thought) while taking=
 more interaction steps, automatically learning to trade thinking for doing=
.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span>This fu=
ndamentally challenges how we approach AI agent development. Instead of bui=
lding agents that are excellent armchair philosophers, we need agents that =
learn by doing - much like humans do. This is particularly important for re=
al-world applications where environments are dynamic and information is inc=
omplete. Their work shows that interaction itself is a form of compute that=
 can be scaled, opening new avenues for agent training beyond just making m=
odels larger or their reasoning deeper. For practical applications like web=
 automation, customer service, or robotic control, this means we can build =
agents that adapt in real-time rather than being stuck with pre-planned beh=
aviors. The approach also demonstrates a form of self-improvement where age=
nts learn from their own synthetic data, potentially reducing reliance on e=
xpensive human-annotated datasets.</span></p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;=

es it solve?</strong><span> While Large Language Models like GPT-4 have bec=
ome remarkably capable at understanding everyday images and text, they stru=
ggle when it comes to medical applications. Think of it like asking a brill=
iant generalist to suddenly perform surgery - they might understand the con=
cepts, but lack the specialized expertise. Current medical MLLMs face three=
 major roadblocks: they mostly focus on medical images while ignoring the v=
ast wealth of medical text knowledge, they're prone to &quot;hallucinating&=
quot; (making up plausible-sounding but incorrect medical information), and=
 they lack the sophisticated reasoning abilities that doctors use when maki=
ng complex diagnoses. This gap is particularly concerning given that medica=
l AI needs to be both comprehensive and reliable.</span></p><p style=3D"mar=

trong>How does it solve the problem? </strong><span>The researchers develop=
ed Lingshu through a comprehensive data curation pipeline that goes beyond =
just collecting medical images. They gathered medical knowledge from multip=
le sources - imaging data, extensive medical texts, and even general-domain=
 data - then synthesized high-quality training examples including detailed =
medical captions, visual question-answering pairs, and chain-of-thought rea=
soning samples. The model undergoes multi-stage training that progressively=
 builds medical expertise, similar to how medical students progress from ba=
sic anatomy to complex clinical reasoning. They also explored using reinfor=
cement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance the model's medic=
al reasoning abilities. Additionally, they created MedEvalKit, a standardiz=
ed evaluation framework that consolidates various medical benchmarks for fa=
ir comparison.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=

trong><span> Lingshu consistently outperforms existing open-source multimod=
al models across most medical tasks evaluated. The model demonstrates stron=
g performance on three fundamental medical capabilities: multimodal questio=
n answering (understanding and answering questions about medical images), t=
ext-based medical QA, and medical report generation. For instance, Lingshu-=
32B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 66.6 acr=
oss multimodal benchmarks, outperforming both proprietary and open-source c=
ompetitors. The researchers also conducted five real-world case studies sho=
wing Lingshu's practical utility in scenarios like medical diagnosis, radio=
logy report generation, and patient consultations.</span></p><p style=3D"ma=

strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span>By addressing the limitations of =
existing medical MLLMs - particularly their narrow focus on images and susc=
eptibility to errors - Lingshu provides a more holistic and reliable founda=
tion for medical AI applications. The comprehensive evaluation framework (M=
edEvalKit) is equally important as it establishes standardized benchmarks f=
or the field, enabling fair comparisons and driving future improvements. Mo=
st critically, the demonstrated real-world applications suggest that such m=
odels could meaningfully assist healthcare professionals in clinical practi=

tion systems like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion typically require two major co=
mponents: a tokenizer that compresses images into a compact representation,=
 and a separate generative model (like a diffusion model) that learns to cr=
eate new images in this compressed space. Training these generative models =
is computationally expensive and time-consuming. The authors investigate wh=
ether the tokenizer itself - specifically highly compressed 1D tokenizers t=
hat squeeze entire images into just 32 discrete tokens - might already poss=
ess generative capabilities without needing any additional model training. =
This is like asking whether a really good compression algorithm might inher=
ently understand images well enough to create new ones.</span></p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> The researchers =
took a pretrained TiTok 1D tokenizer and explored its capabilities through =
increasingly sophisticated experiments. First, they discovered that specifi=
c token positions correspond to high-level image attributes (like lighting =
or blur), enabling simple &quot;copy-paste&quot; operations between images'=
 token representations to transfer these attributes. Building on this insig=
ht, they developed a gradient-based optimization approach that directly man=
ipulates tokens at test time using objectives like CLIP similarity (for tex=
t-guided editing) or reconstruction loss (for inpainting). This optimizatio=
n doesn't require any training - it just iteratively adjusts the tokens to =
maximize the desired objective, similar to how you might adjust sliders in =
photo editing software until the image looks right.</span></p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
<strong>What are the key findings?</strong><span> They demonstrate that hig=
hly compressed tokenizers can indeed function as generative models without =
additional training. The authors achieved an FID score of 8.2 on ImageNet g=
eneration (lower is better), competitive with methods that require extensiv=
e generative model training. They found that higher compression ratios para=
doxically lead to better generative performance - tokenizers producing just=
 32 tokens outperformed those using 64 or 128 tokens. The system successful=
ly performs text-guided image editing, inpainting, and even generates image=
s from scratch using only test-time optimization. Remarkably, simple token =
manipulations like copying tokens between images can reliably transfer appe=
arance attributes like lighting conditions or background blur.</span></p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><span> Their findings sugges=
t that extreme compression forces tokenizers to learn such rich, semantic r=
epresentations that they become implicit generative models - essentially le=
arning not just how to compress images, but understanding what makes an ima=
ge valid. This could dramatically reduce the computational resources needed=
 for image generation, as it eliminates the need to train separate generati=
ve models. The work also provides insights into the nature of visual repres=
entation learning: when you compress an image into just 32 tokens, each tok=
en must capture global, meaningful information about the image, creating a =
latent space that's inherently suitable for generation and manipulation.</s=
