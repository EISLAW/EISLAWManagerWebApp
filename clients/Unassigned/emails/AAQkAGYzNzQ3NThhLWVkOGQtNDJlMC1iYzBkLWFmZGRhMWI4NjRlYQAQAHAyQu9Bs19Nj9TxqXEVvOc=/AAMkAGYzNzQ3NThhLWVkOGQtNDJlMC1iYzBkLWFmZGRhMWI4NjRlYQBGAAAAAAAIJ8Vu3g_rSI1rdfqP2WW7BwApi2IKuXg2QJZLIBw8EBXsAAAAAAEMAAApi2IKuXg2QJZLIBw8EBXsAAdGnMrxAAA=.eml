HOW ISRAEL CAUGHT IRAN OFF-GUARD [3]
TEHRAN FAILED TO ANTICIPATE A MILITARY STRIKE THAT COULD SPELL THE END OF ITS GOVERNING REGIME.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Ever since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been conscious of its precarious security situation, which is a result of its small geographic size and hostile regional environment. In addition to
building a competent defense force capable of fighting on multiple fronts, it has therefore invested in developing a first-rate intelligence community that seeks to eliminate its most significant
security challenges. The ongoing Israeli campaign against Iran, code-named Rising Lion, shows that Iran – which continuously brags about its technological achievements, cyber and military
intelligence, and information analysis – failed not only to anticipate the Israeli offensive but also to prevent Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency from penetrating deep into the country.
Since the 1950s, the Iranians have assumed that the U.S. has a vested interest in maintaining Iran as a buffer between the West and the former Soviet Union. This perception continued even after the
Islamic Revolution in 1979. With China’s emergence as a global economic and military power, the Iranians believed that the U.S. still needed them to prevent Beijing from intruding into the oil-rich
Persian Gulf. Tehran has thus presented itself as a peacemaker while also supporting Arab Shiite militias to fight its subversive regional wars. Since the 1980s, Iranian policy has aimed to avoid a
direct military confrontation with Israel, believing a war on its territory could garner a humiliating result. However, following the destruction of Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, the country
finally found itself facing a direct fight with Israel. This confrontation could have dire consequences not only for the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime but also for the country’s territorial
integrity.
ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE
Israel’s attack on Iran last week in some ways resembled past Israeli operations that relied heavily on intelligence, espionage and disinformation. In 1954, Israel organized a false flag operation
targeting U.S. and British civilian interests in Egypt in what became known as the Lavon affair. The aim of the ill-fated plot was to sway Britain against evacuating troops from the Suez Canal area
and to undermine warming U.S.-Egypt relations. In 1962, Israel launched Operation Damocles, aimed at obstructing the development of Egypt’s rocket program led by former Nazi German scientists. Six
of the scientists were eliminated and the others quit the program, leading to its dismantlement.
Just days before the start of the 1967 Six-Day War, the U.S. gave Israel the green light to launch the war despite agreeing to a visit by Egyptian Vice President Zakaria Mohieddin to Washington,
ostensibly aimed at defusing the crisis and avoiding conflict. U.S. State Department officials told Jordan’s King Hussein that Israel would start the war on June 5. He informed Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser, who dismissed the warning. Thus, Egyptian radars were off when the first wave of Israeli jets attacked Egyptian air bases.
Before Israel launched its campaign against Hezbollah last fall, it carried out Operation Grim Beeper, in which explosives concealed inside thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah
members were detonated. Days later, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with many senior military commanders, was assassinated. Nasrallah’s successor, Hashem Safieddine, was killed the following
month, decimating Hezbollah’s entire political and military leadership before Israel’s advance into southern Lebanon.
A LESSON NOT LEARNED
In the weeks leading up to Israel’s strike last week, indications were that it was unlikely to launch an attack on Iran without receiving a green light from Washington. It appeared that President
Donald Trump was unlikely to give sign off on a strike because a nuclear deal with Iran seemed close. There had been much talk in Israel that the window for a preemptive strike against Iran was
closing, and the Iranians believed a strike would not take place before their sixth round of negotiations with the U.S., set for June 15 in Muscat.
But the Israeli security establishment assessed that Iran was domestically weaker than ever. Israel therefore prepared a comprehensive plan to attack Iranian nuclear sites and ballistic missile
depots. The plan was reportedly delayed due to objections from Trump, who wanted to give negotiations with Tehran a chance. The Iranians believed that Trump would not authorize an Israeli operation.
U.S. officials said at the time that such a strike would create a rupture between the Netanyahu government and the Trump administration. Trump himself said an Israeli strike on Iran was possible but
not imminent.
These statements have since been deemed part of a disinformation campaign. Privately, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff warned senior Senate Republicans that Iran could launch a large-scale attack,
resulting in massive casualties, if Israel bombed its nuclear facilities. According to U.S. intelligence estimates, Iran possesses approximately 2,000 ballistic missiles capable of carrying
900-kilogram (2,000-pound) warheads.
To increase the element of surprise, Israeli media reported that military chief of staff Eyal Zamir and Air Force Commander Tomer Bar informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel alone
cannot confront Iran if a direct war breaks out. Israel made great efforts to keep planning for this attack secret and tightly controlled until its launch. The session in which Israel’s security
Cabinet approved the strike was said to have been about the war in Gaza. The Trump administration has not officially expressed support for the operation, but its decision to withdraw nonessential U.S.
personnel from the Gulf and Iraq and senior officials’ declarations in Washington about readiness to defend the U.S. and Israel have hinted at tacit support for Israel’s decision. Trump likely
hoped that the strike would persuade Tehran to comply with his insistence that it dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
ISRAEL STRIKES
When it became clear that Israel was about to attack, commanders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps air force met at a fortified underground site to coordinate a response. Israel was aware
of the emergency protocol and location of the site, and destroyed it. They were among more than 20 Iranian commanders targeted in the opening attack on the military’s command and control. Another
primary target was Iranian air defense systems and radars that Israeli intelligence had identified. The Israeli air force hit most of them in the initial strike, giving it freedom to operate in
Iranian skies virtually unchallenged. Subsequent strikes hit Iran’s nuclear facilities, ballistic missile plants and military infrastructure. They targeted the hierarchy of decision-making and the
IRGC. Some 14 atomic scientists have been assassinated, indicating that the target was not the Iranian people or infrastructure but rather Iran’s nuclear program.

At the same time, Mossad was carrying out a series of covert sabotage operations deep inside Iran to destroy its air defenses and ballistic missile launchers. The opening strike involved hundreds of
Mossad agents both inside Iran and at headquarters, including a special unit of Iranian agents working for the Israeli intelligence agency. In central Iran, Mossad commando units positioned guided
weapons systems in open areas near Iranian surface-to-air missile launchers. In another part of Iran, Mossad secretly deployed advanced weapons systems and technologies hidden in vehicles. When the
Israeli attack began, operatives launched them, destroying Iranian air defense targets. Mossad also maintained a base for attack drones inside Iran, using drones smuggled in long before the operation
to destroy ballistic missiles.
IRAN’S DEBACLE
The Israelis insisted that any nuclear agreement include the complete dismantling of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure (including centrifuges and its heavy water reactor), a halt to the development of
nuclear warheads and the complete removal of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile. By attacking Iran, Netanyahu is trying to establish himself as a historical Israeli hero who has ensured the long-term
existence of the Jewish state and permanently eliminated the two-state solution proposal. His goal is to bring down the last remaining state obstructing normalization of relations with regional
governments. He desires to impose normalization on Israeli terms and to extend it to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. This requires undermining the Iranian regime. He has even promised Azerbaijani
President Ilham Aliyev that he will return the Iranian province of East Azerbaijan to the mother country.
Neutralizing the fuel enrichment plant at Fordow is essential to dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, but the facility lies 90 meters underground. Netanyahu wants to convince Trump to deploy U.S.
heavy bombers in an attack on Fordow, since Israel does not have its own bombers. Trump will likely eventually commit the U.S. Air Force to achieving this objective.
Iran views the demand that it halt its uranium enrichment activities and dismantle its nuclear program as a nonstarter. If the ayatollahs were to acquiesce on this point, the regime would lose its
political and strategic credibility and be on the verge of collapse. In this case, a military confrontation, with all its disastrous consequences, would be far preferable.
For more than four decades, Iran has used its regional proxies to advance its geopolitical and geostrategic interests in the region. However, now that it has lost its allies – particularly
Hezbollah, the Assad regime in Syria and Shiite militias in the region – the Iranian regime finds itself at risk of collapse.
The ball is now in Tehran’s court. Trump has called on the Iranian government to return to the negotiating table. The Israeli attack placed Iran between two bitter paths. It is unable to fulfill its
supreme leader’s promise to launch a devastating response to Israel without support from China or Russia, which have informed Iranian leaders that they are unwilling to help. The other option –
its traditional approach of launching measured strikes that do not provoke the U.S. – will portray Iran as a weak state before its people and encourage them to turn against it when the war ends.
Iran chose to continue pursuing its traditional path. It did not attack, for example, the Dimona nuclear reactor or Israel’s gas fields in the Mediterranean. It has decided instead to deal with any
internal unrest later, using the same repressive methods it previously employed.
OUTLOOK FOR IRAN
The U.S. does not seek to cripple Iran militarily or existentially but rather to disrupt its determination to dominate the region. The American vision for the region rests on four pillars: Israel,
Iran, the Gulf and Turkey. Any disruption to these pillars would jeopardize U.S. interests in the Middle East and hinder its efforts to consolidate its presence and influence. However, Iran suffers
from fundamental shortcomings that have accumulated over nearly half a century. Its economy is collapsing and the Iranian people are increasingly frustrated, resulting in accelerating demands for
political change. Amid the rapid transformations taking place in the region, Iran now faces greater and more complex challenges that threaten its internal stability, regional security and regime
survival.
One of Israel’s goals is to topple the regime, believing that only this will free Israel from Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Israel’s military campaign has shown the Iranian people the extent of the
regime’s frailty, which will encourage them to rebel against it. The regime has not implemented political and economic reforms to ensure its survival; instead, it has relied primarily on its
security apparatus for support. Now that the security apparatus is severely deteriorating, the Iranian regime is on the verge of collapse.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ever since its est=
ablishment in 1948, Israel has been conscious of its precarious security si=
tuation, which is a result of its small geographic size and hostile regiona=
l environment. In addition to building a competent defense force capable of=
 fighting on multiple fronts, it has therefore invested in developing a fir=
st-rate intelligence community that seeks to eliminate its most significant=
 security challenges. The ongoing Israeli campaign against Iran, code-named=
 Rising Lion, shows that Iran =E2=80=93 which continuously brags about its =
technological achievements, cyber and military intelligence, and informatio=
n analysis =E2=80=93 failed not only to anticipate the Israeli offensive bu=
t also to prevent Israel=E2=80=99s Mossad intelligence agency from penetrat=
ing deep into the country.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Since the 1950s, t=
he Iranians have assumed that the U.S. has a vested interest in maintaining=
 Iran as a buffer between the West and the former Soviet Union. This percep=
tion continued even after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. With China=E2=80=
=99s emergence as a global economic and military power, the Iranians believ=
ed that the U.S. still needed them to prevent Beijing from intruding into t=
he oil-rich Persian Gulf. Tehran has thus presented itself as a peacemaker =
while also supporting Arab Shiite militias to fight its subversive regional=
 wars. Since the 1980s, Iranian policy has aimed to avoid a direct military=
 confrontation with Israel, believing a war on its territory could garner a=
 humiliating result. However, following the destruction of Iran=E2=80=99s s=
o-called axis of resistance, the country finally found itself facing a dire=
ct fight with Israel. This confrontation could have dire consequences not o=
nly for the survival of Iran=E2=80=99s Islamic regime but also for the coun=
try=E2=80=99s territorial integrity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Israeli In=
telligence</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s a=
ttack on Iran last week in some ways resembled past Israeli operations that=
 relied heavily on intelligence, espionage and disinformation. In 1954, Isr=
ael organized a false flag operation targeting U.S. and British civilian in=
terests in Egypt in what became known as the Lavon affair. The aim of the i=
ll-fated plot was to sway Britain against evacuating troops from the Suez C=
anal area and to undermine warming U.S.-Egypt relations. In 1962, Israel la=
unched Operation Damocles, aimed at obstructing the development of Egypt=E2=
=80=99s rocket program led by former Nazi German scientists. Six of the sci=
entists were eliminated and the others quit the program, leading to its dis=
mantlement.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Just days before t=
he start of the 1967 Six-Day War, the U.S. gave Israel the green light to l=
aunch the war despite agreeing to a visit by Egyptian Vice President Zakari=
a Mohieddin to Washington, ostensibly aimed at defusing the crisis and avoi=
ding conflict. U.S. State Department officials told Jordan=E2=80=99s King H=
ussein that Israel would start the war on June 5. He informed Egyptian Pres=
ident Gamal Abdel Nasser, who dismissed the warning. Thus, Egyptian radars =
were off when the first wave of Israeli jets attacked Egyptian air bases.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Before Israel laun=
ched its campaign against Hezbollah last fall, it carried out Operation Gri=
m Beeper, in which explosives concealed inside thousands of pagers and walk=
ie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members were detonated. Days later, Hezbollah=
 chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with many senior military commanders, was as=
sassinated. Nasrallah=E2=80=99s successor, Hashem Safieddine, was killed th=
e following month, decimating Hezbollah=E2=80=99s entire political and mili=
tary leadership before Israel=E2=80=99s advance into southern Lebanon.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>A Lesson N=
ot Learned</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the weeks leadi=
ng up to Israel=E2=80=99s strike last week, indications were that it was un=
likely to launch an attack on Iran without receiving a green light from Was=
hington. It appeared that President Donald Trump was unlikely to give sign =
off on a strike because a nuclear deal with Iran seemed close. There had be=
en much talk in Israel that the window for a preemptive strike against Iran=
 was closing, and the Iranians believed a strike would not take place befor=
e their sixth round of negotiations with the U.S., set for June 15 in Musca=
t.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But the Israeli se=
curity establishment assessed that Iran was domestically weaker than ever. =
Israel therefore prepared a comprehensive plan to attack Iranian nuclear si=
tes and ballistic missile depots. The plan was reportedly delayed due to ob=
jections from Trump, who wanted to give negotiations with Tehran a chance. =
The Iranians believed that Trump would not authorize an Israeli operation. =
U.S. officials said at the time that such a strike would create a rupture b=
etween the Netanyahu government and the Trump administration. Trump himself=
 said an Israeli strike on Iran was possible but not imminent.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These statements h=
ave since been deemed part of a disinformation campaign. Privately, U.S. Mi=
ddle East envoy Steve Witkoff warned senior Senate Republicans that Iran co=
uld launch a large-scale attack, resulting in massive casualties, if Israel=
 bombed its nuclear facilities. According to U.S. intelligence estimates, I=
ran possesses approximately 2,000 ballistic missiles capable of carrying 90=
0-kilogram (2,000-pound) warheads.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To increase the el=
ement of surprise, Israeli media reported that military chief of staff Eyal=
 Zamir and Air Force Commander Tomer Bar informed Prime Minister Benjamin N=
etanyahu that Israel alone cannot confront Iran if a direct war breaks out.=
 Israel made great efforts to keep planning for this attack secret and tigh=
tly controlled until its launch. The session in which Israel=E2=80=99s secu=
rity Cabinet approved the strike was said to have been about the war in Gaz=
a. The Trump administration has not officially expressed support for the op=
eration, but its decision to withdraw nonessential U.S. personnel from the =
Gulf and Iraq and senior officials=E2=80=99 declarations in Washington abou=
t readiness to defend the U.S. and Israel have hinted at tacit support for =
Israel=E2=80=99s decision. Trump likely hoped that the strike would persuad=
e Tehran to comply with his insistence that it dismantle its nuclear and ba=
llistic missile programs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Israel Str=
ikes</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">When it became cle=
ar that Israel was about to attack, commanders of Iran=E2=80=99s Islamic Re=
volutionary Guard Corps air force met at a fortified underground site to co=
ordinate a response. Israel was aware of the emergency protocol and locatio=
n of the site, and destroyed it. They were among more than 20 Iranian comma=
nders targeted in the opening attack on the military=E2=80=99s command and =
control. Another primary target was Iranian air defense systems and radars =
that Israeli intelligence had identified. The Israeli air force hit most of=
 them in the initial strike, giving it freedom to operate in Iranian skies =
virtually unchallenged. Subsequent strikes hit Iran=E2=80=99s nuclear facil=
ities, ballistic missile plants and military infrastructure. They targeted =
the hierarchy of decision-making and the IRGC. Some 14 atomic scientists ha=
ve been assassinated, indicating that the target was not the Iranian people=
 or infrastructure but rather Iran=E2=80=99s nuclear program.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">At the same time, =
Mossad was carrying out a series of covert sabotage operations deep inside =
Iran to destroy its air defenses and ballistic missile launchers. The openi=
ng strike involved hundreds of Mossad agents both inside Iran and at headqu=
arters, including a special unit of Iranian agents working for the Israeli =
intelligence agency. In central Iran, Mossad commando units positioned guid=
ed weapons systems in open areas near Iranian surface-to-air missile launch=
ers. In another part of Iran, Mossad secretly deployed advanced weapons sys=
tems and technologies hidden in vehicles. When the Israeli attack began, op=
eratives launched them, destroying Iranian air defense targets. Mossad also=
 maintained a base for attack drones inside Iran, using drones smuggled in =
long before the operation to destroy ballistic missiles.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Iran=E2=80=
=99s Debacle</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Israelis insis=
ted that any nuclear agreement include the complete dismantling of Iran=E2=
=80=99s nuclear infrastructure (including centrifuges and its heavy water r=
eactor), a halt to the development of nuclear warheads and the complete rem=
oval of Iran=E2=80=99s enriched uranium stockpile. By attacking Iran, Netan=
yahu is trying to establish himself as a historical Israeli hero who has en=
sured the long-term existence of the Jewish state and permanently eliminate=
d the two-state solution proposal. His goal is to bring down the last remai=
ning state obstructing normalization of relations with regional governments=
. He desires to impose normalization on Israeli terms and to extend it to L=
ebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. This requires undermining the Iranian regime=
. He has even promised Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev that he will retu=
rn the Iranian province of East Azerbaijan to the mother country.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Neutralizing the f=
uel enrichment plant at Fordow is essential to dismantling Iran=E2=80=99s n=
uclear program, but the facility lies 90 meters underground. Netanyahu want=
s to convince Trump to deploy U.S. heavy bombers in an attack on Fordow, si=
nce Israel does not have its own bombers. Trump will likely eventually comm=
it the U.S. Air Force to achieving this objective.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Iran views the dem=
and that it halt its uranium enrichment activities and dismantle its nuclea=
r program as a nonstarter. If the ayatollahs were to acquiesce on this poin=
t, the regime would lose its political and strategic credibility and be on =
the verge of collapse. In this case, a military confrontation, with all its=
 disastrous consequences, would be far preferable.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For more than four=
 decades, Iran has used its regional proxies to advance its geopolitical an=
d geostrategic interests in the region. However, now that it has lost its a=
llies =E2=80=93 particularly Hezbollah, the Assad regime in Syria and Shiit=
e militias in the region =E2=80=93 the Iranian regime finds itself at risk =
of collapse.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The ball is now in=
 Tehran=E2=80=99s court. Trump has called on the Iranian government to retu=
rn to the negotiating table. The Israeli attack placed Iran between two bit=
ter paths. It is unable to fulfill its supreme leader=E2=80=99s promise to =
launch a devastating response to Israel without support from China or Russi=
a, which have informed Iranian leaders that they are unwilling to help. The=
 other option =E2=80=93 its traditional approach of launching measured stri=
kes that do not provoke the U.S. =E2=80=93 will portray Iran as a weak stat=
e before its people and encourage them to turn against it when the war ends=
. Iran chose to continue pursuing its traditional path. It did not attack, =
for example, the Dimona nuclear reactor or Israel=E2=80=99s gas fields in t=
he Mediterranean. It has decided instead to deal with any internal unrest l=
ater, using the same repressive methods it previously employed.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Outlook fo=
r Iran</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. does not =
seek to cripple Iran militarily or existentially but rather to disrupt its =
determination to dominate the region. The American vision for the region re=
sts on four pillars: Israel, Iran, the Gulf and Turkey. Any disruption to t=
hese pillars would jeopardize U.S. interests in the Middle East and hinder =
its efforts to consolidate its presence and influence. However, Iran suffer=
s from fundamental shortcomings that have accumulated over nearly half a ce=
ntury. Its economy is collapsing and the Iranian people are increasingly fr=
ustrated, resulting in accelerating demands for political change. Amid the =
rapid transformations taking place in the region, Iran now faces greater an=
d more complex challenges that threaten its internal stability, regional se=
curity and regime survival.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">One of Israel=E2=
=80=99s goals is to topple the regime, believing that only this will free I=
srael from Iran=E2=80=99s nuclear ambitions. Israel=E2=80=99s military camp=
aign has shown the Iranian people the extent of the regime=E2=80=99s frailt=
y, which will encourage them to rebel against it. The regime has not implem=
ented political and economic reforms to ensure its survival; instead, it ha=
s relied primarily on its security apparatus for support. Now that the secu=
rity apparatus is severely deteriorating, the Iranian regime is on the verg=
e of collapse.</p>
