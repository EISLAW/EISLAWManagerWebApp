Welcome, Watcher! This week I=E2=80=99ll try out a new format. As compensat=
ion  you will get not three, not four, not five - but nine! - paper highlig=
hts. So let=E2=80=99s get started!
When models learn to think by playing games
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/87fd5066-875a-4fb9-b9bc-78d321d0e49f=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code=

yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) The conve=
ntional wisdom in AI has been straightforward: train on more data, get bett=
er results. But researchers at various institutions are discovering that ho=
w models learn matters as much as what they learn. The SPIRAL framework dem=
onstrates this beautifully by having language models play zero-sum games ag=
ainst themselves.
Rather than relying on expensive human-curated datasets, SPIRAL creates an =
infinite curriculum where models continuously face stronger opponents. The =
results are striking: a Qwen3-4B model trained through self-play shows 8.6%=
 improvement on mathematical tasks and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperfor=
ming traditional supervised fine-tuning on 25,000 expert examples. The secr=
et? Three cognitive patterns emerge naturally from competitive play: system=
atic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis.
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/b4f05225-1721-4743-a2fe-8dca7efbf6b6=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code=

yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) This find=
ing connects directly to Sakana AI's AB-MCTS (Adaptive Branching Monte Carl=
o Tree Search), which takes a different but complementary approach. Instead=
 of training through games, AB-MCTS enables multiple AI models to collabora=
te at inference time through intelligent trial-and-error. The system dynami=
cally decides whether to explore new solution paths or refine existing ones=
, achieving 30% success rate on ARC-AGI-2 tasks - a significant improvement=
 over any single model's 23% baseline.
What makes AB-MCTS particularly intriguing is its demonstration that differ=
ent AI models can solve problems together that none could solve alone. When=
 ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek work in concert through the AB-MCTS framewor=
k, incorrect solutions from one model become valuable hints for others. It'=
s collective intelligence in action, released as open-source TreeQuest for =
the community to build upon.

nly TED conference dedicated to Artificial Intelligence =E2=80=93 with Vien=
na being one of the few select locations, and the only one in Europe.=20
Last year=E2=80=99s TEDAI Vienna 2024 has been the first of its kind and ca=
n be considered a huge success. Some of the most important decision makers =
from all over the world came together with leading AI experts for 3 days, i=
ncluding dinners, talks, workshops, and much more.
The math trap: When specialization backfires
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e9a0424f-3ebc-4542-b2e3-fa998bf51dc9=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code=

yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) Perhaps t=
he most surprising finding this week comes from Maggie Huan and colleagues,=
 who ask a question the field has been avoiding: Does improving math reason=
ing actually make models smarter overall? Their comprehensive evaluation of=
 over 20 reasoning-tuned models reveals an uncomfortable truth: most models=
 that excel at mathematics fail to transfer these gains to other domains.
The culprit? Training methodology. Models fine-tuned with supervised learni=
ng often experience "catastrophic forgetting" of general capabilities, whil=
e those trained with reinforcement learning maintain broader competence. Th=
is discovery has immediate implications for how we develop AI systems - the=
 current race to top math leaderboards might be leading us astray (paper/co=
de).
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/bd724caa-5af1-4dbd-8697-cffad02723e1=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/ccd6ab77-2345-4aa7-bd5a-ca8d5a461d67?j=3De=
yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) This conc=
ern is elegantly addressed with OctoThinker, which investigates what makes =
a base model suitable for reinforcement learning. Their key innovation is a=
 "stable-then-decay" training strategy: first training on 200 billion token=
s with constant learning rate, then continuing on 20 billion tokens with de=
cay. The result? 10-20% improvement across mathematical benchmarks while ma=
intaining general capabilities.
The Meta research team's investigation into bridging offline and online rei=
nforcement learning provides additional nuance. Their surprising finding: s=
emi-online training nearly matches fully online performance while offering =
significant efficiency benefits. This suggests we might not need the most c=
omputationally expensive training approaches to achieve strong results.
Understanding the black box: Which thoughts matter?
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/39c39cd8-7359-4556-9822-c46278b40763=

yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) As models=
 become more capable, understanding their reasoning becomes critical. "Thou=
ght Anchors=E2=80=9D tackle this by identifying which reasoning steps have =
outsized importance in chain-of-thought reasoning.
Their analysis of DeepSeek and Llama models reveals that planning and uncer=
tainty management sentences consistently emerge as critical decision points=

s interpretability work complements a theoretical breakthrough from Nanjing=
 University's LAMDA Group. Their research on "Generalist Reward Models" pro=
ves that any LLM trained via standard next-token prediction already contain=
s a latent, powerful reward model. This "endogenous reward" is mathematical=
ly equivalent to rewards learned through offline inverse reinforcement lear=
ning - a discovery that could eliminate the need for expensive human prefer=
ence data in model alignment.
The unified intelligence frontier

soning improvements capture headlines, equally important advances are happe=
ning in multimodal AI. Alibaba's WorldVLA and UniVLA from multiple institut=
ions represent complementary approaches to unified vision-language-action m=
odels.
UniVLA's breakthrough is its autoregressive tokenization of vision, languag=
e, and action as discrete sequences, achieving 95.5% success rate on LIBERO=
 robotic manipulation tasks - significantly outperforming previous approach=
es while using less than 1/20 of the pre-training compute. The key insight:=
 incorporating world modeling during post-training to capture causal dynami=
cs from videos.

takes this further by proposing that action models and world models shouldn=
't operate in isolation. Their unified framework shows 4% improvement in gr=
asping success and 10% reduction in video prediction error. The mutual enha=
ncement principle - where action understanding aids visual generation and v=
ice versa - points toward more integrated AI systems.
Evaluating the evaluators

yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) As AI age=
nts become more autonomous, evaluating them becomes increasingly complex. O=
hio State's Mind2Web 2 benchmark addresses this with 130 realistic, long-ho=
rizon tasks requiring real-time web browsing and information synthesis. The=
ir new "Agent-as-a-Judge" framework uses task-specific judge agents with tr=
ee-structured rubrics, showing that OpenAI's Deep Research reaches 50-70% o=
f human performance while working twice as fast.
What this means for AI's future
The era of simply scaling up models and training data is giving way to more=
 sophisticated approaches that emphasize:
Smarter training strategies that preserve general capabilities while improv=
ing specific skills. The success of reinforcement learning over supervised =
fine-tuning, the promise of self-play, and the efficiency of semi-online tr=
aining all point toward more nuanced training methodologies.
Inference-time intelligence through techniques like AB-MCTS that enable mod=
els to =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=80=9D harder about difficult problems and collabor=
ate effectively. The ability to achieve better results without additional t=
raining opens new possibilities for deploying AI systems.
Unified architectures that break down barriers between modalities and capab=
ilities. The convergence of vision, language, and action in single models, =
along with the theoretical understanding that different neural network para=
digms are fundamentally related, suggests we're moving toward more general =
AI systems.
Better evaluation and interpretability that goes beyond simple benchmarks t=
o understand how models reason and which reasoning steps matter most. This =
deeper understanding is crucial for building AI systems we can trust in hig=
h-stakes applications.
The message is clear: the next breakthrough in AI might not come from build=
ing bigger models, but from teaching our current models to reason better, w=
ork together more effectively, and maintain their general capabilities whil=
e developing specialized skills.=20
