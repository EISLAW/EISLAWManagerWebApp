Last week, I watched an AI agent try to book a flight. It was a silly exper=
iment since I personally do not have interest in booking flights via autono=
mous AI, but it=E2=80=99s a suitable use case for demonstrating a fundament=
al issue: poor agency scoping.=20
So, what happened? Within three minutes, it had opened seventeen browser ta=
bs, attempted to purchase business class tickets to Paris (I wanted economy=
), and somehow ended up researching the history of French aviation. This wa=
sn't a broken, sloppy prototype - it was a sophisticated agent with access =
to web browsing, memory, and calendar integration. It just had too much aut=
onomy, too soon.
This experience stands for something I've been witnessing in dozens of proj=
ects that included building AI agents: most people tend to give these syste=
ms the keys to the kingdom before they've learned to open doors. The result=
? A crisis of trust that's holding back the entire field of agentic enterpr=
ise AI.
But there's a better way. Over the past year, working with teams at dozens =
of companies from legacy enterprises to tech startups, a pattern has emerge=
d. The teams succeeding with AI agents aren't the ones building the most so=
phisticated systems. They=E2=80=99re the ones implicitly following what I s=
tarted to call the Principle of Least Autonomy (PoLA, borrowed from the Pri=
nciple of Least Privilege in information security) - a framework that treat=
s agent development like training a new team member, where trust and indepe=
ndence are earned progressively through demonstrated competence.
The Agency Paradox: Why More Capability Means Less Control
Here's a truth about AI agents that decision makers tend to overlook: every=
 increase in agency creates a corresponding decrease in control. This is no=
t a bug, it's inherent. When you give an AI system the ability to make deci=
sions and take actions on your behalf, you necessarily give up some ability=
 to predict and constrain its behavior.
Traditional software doesn't work this way. When you write if (user.clicks)=
 then (open.menu), you know exactly what will happen. But when you tell an =
AI agent to "handle customer support tickets," you're entering a world of n=
on-deterministic behavior where the same input might generate wildly differ=
ent outputs depending on context, training, and what the model had for brea=
kfast (metaphorically speaking).
This creates an agency-control tradeoff - think of it as a seesaw:
High control, low agency: The AI suggests responses, humans review everythi=
ng (copilot mode)
Medium control, medium agency: The AI makes decisions within boundaries, es=
calates edge cases
Low control, high agency: The AI operates independently, humans monitor out=
comes
Most teams jump straight to the high-agency end because that's where the pr=
omised productivity gains live. It's also where things spectacularly fall a=
part.
The Principle of Least Autonomy: Start Smaller Than You Think
The Guided Autonomy framework begins with a counterintuitive principle: giv=
e your AI agents the minimum autonomy necessary to demonstrate value, not t=
he maximum autonomy technically possible.
This is the opposite of how most teams approach agent development. Instead =
of asking "what's the most sophisticated thing we can build?", ask "what's =
the simplest useful behavior we can verify?"
Consider how Anthropic approached Claude's new computer-use capability. The=
y didn't start by letting it control entire workflows. First, it learned to=
 take screenshots. Then to identify UI elements. Then to click buttons. Onl=
y after proving competence at each level did it earn the right to chain the=
se actions together. Even now, it operates with extensive guardrails and re=
quires explicit user permission for sensitive actions.
This incremental approach might seem slow, but it's actually faster than th=
e alternative: rebuilding trust after your agent goes rogue. A company I wo=
rked with learned this the hard way when their customer service agent achie=
ved a 94% resolution rate but also promised refunds to anyone who mentioned=
 the word "disappointed." I had to come in for the cleanup.=20

The CC/CD Framework: How Agents Actually Learn
Building reliable agents requires a fundamentally different development lif=
ecycle than traditional software. Machine Learning models need constant cal=
ibration, AI agents even more so, as the outputs they can create are usuall=
y much more complex (classifications vs. actions). Continuous Calibration (=
CC), which has emerged [ https://substack.com/redirect/ce0d9768-5646-4ba8-8=
ecf-928b1f1d578d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=
AjMRMPOw0 ] as an AI-specific variant of CI/CD [ https://substack.com/redir=
ect/946a02e1-6ace-4c73-bea4-224a5c9bc6c2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxP=
mLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], addresses this challenge. If CI/CD is =
about shipping code reliably, CC/CD is about shipping behavior reliably.
Continuous Development: Defining the Ladder Rungs
A key part of the Guided Autonomy development framework is about defining c=
apability levels for AI agents. Think of it as creating a trust ladder with=
 clearly defined rungs:
Level 1 - Observe and Report Your agent watches workflows and identifies pa=
tterns but takes no action. A sales agent might analyze email threads and f=
lag follow-up opportunities without sending anything.
Level 2 - Draft and Suggest The agent creates content but requires human ap=
proval. That sales agent now drafts responses but waits for your review.
Level 3 - Act with Boundaries
The agent operates independently within strict constraints. It might send f=
ollow-ups to existing conversations but can't initiate new ones.
Level 4 - Autonomous with Oversight Full agency with exception handling. Th=
e agent manages entire workflows but escalates unusual situations.
Each level needs three components:
Capability scope: What exactly can the agent do?
Success metrics: How do we measure competence?
Graduation criteria: What proves readiness for more autonomy?
Continuous Calibration: Learning from Reality
Here's where AI agents diverge sharply from traditional software. You can't=
 test all behaviors in advance because you don't know all the behaviors. In=
stead, you need continuous calibration - watching real-world performance an=
d adjusting accordingly.
The calibration loop looks like this:
Run =E2=86=92 Measure =E2=86=92 Analyze =E2=86=92 Adjust =E2=86=92 Repeat
But not all measurements are created equal. The teams I've seen succeed foc=
us on what I call "trust indicators":
Accuracy metrics: Is the agent correct?
Alignment metrics: Does it match your intentions?
Safety metrics: Does it avoid harmful actions?
Efficiency metrics: Does it improve outcomes?
A credit card company using this approach discovered their fraud detection =
agent prototype was 99.2% accurate but had developed an unexpected bias aga=
inst purchases from craft stores. The calibration process caught this befor=
e it affected customers, allowing them to adjust the training data and cons=
traints.
The Measurement Challenge: When Good Enough Isn't
One of the hardest parts of Guided Autonomy (and AI development in general)=
 is defining "good enough." When does an agent graduate from Level 2 to Lev=
el 3? When is 90% accuracy sufficient, and when do you need 99.9%?
The answer depends on what I call the "trust equation":
Trust =3D (Competence x Consistency x Recoverability) / Consequence
Competence: How well does it perform the task?
Consistency: How predictable is performance?
Recoverability: How easily can errors be fixed?
Consequence: What's the cost of failure?
An agent summarizing meeting notes might graduate at 85% accuracy because e=
rrors are easily caught and consequences are minor. An agent executing fina=
ncial trades might need 99.95% accuracy with multiple safeguards because co=
nsequences are severe and potentially irreversible.
This is why the evaluation infrastructure becomes critical. You need:
Observability: See what your agents are actually doing
Traceability: Understand why they made specific decisions
Controllability: Intervene when necessary
Reversibility: Undo actions when things go wrong=20
Damage Control: If reversibility is not possible, potential damage needs to=
 be minimized by design
Progressive Autonomy in Practice: Three Implementation Patterns
Having worked with teams implementing Guided Autonomy, I've identified thre=
e patterns that consistently succeed:
Pattern 1: The Shadow Mode Strategy
Before giving an agent any real autonomy, run it in shadow mode alongside h=
uman workers. The agent performs all actions but doesn't execute them - it =
just logs what it would have done.
A logistics company used this approach for route optimization. For two mont=
hs, their AI agent "shadowed" human dispatchers, generating routes that wer=
e compared against human decisions. Only when the agent consistently outper=
formed humans on efficiency while maintaining delivery success rates did it=
 earn the right to make real routing decisions.
Shadow mode provides two critical benefits:
Risk-free learning from real-world complexity
Direct comparison against human baseline performance
Pattern 2: The Gradual Handoff
Instead of replacing entire workflows, gradually hand off specific subtasks=
 as the agent proves competence.
A marketing team I advised took this approach with content creation:
Week 1-4: Agent suggests blog topics
Week 5-8: Agent creates outlines for approved topics
Week 9-12: Agent writes introductions and conclusions
Week 13-16: Agent drafts complete posts for review
Week 17+: Agent publishes directly for certain content types
Each handoff was contingent on success metrics from the previous phase. The=
 agent earned autonomy through demonstrated competence, not arbitrary timel=
ines.
Pattern 3: The Circuit Breaker Architecture
Build automatic constraints that kick in when agents exhibit unexpected beh=
avior.
A financial services team set up =E2=80=9Ccircuit breakers=E2=80=9D for the=
ir crawling agent:
If error rate exceeds 3%: switch to manual review before accepting fetched =
documents
If robots.txt/sitemap rules change or access is denied: pause crawl and ale=
rt compliance
If download volume or new-source discovery spikes beyond baseline: require =
human approval to proceed
If entity/figure confidence falls below threshold (e.g., EPS, revenue, guid=
ance): switch to human-in-the-loop extraction
These circuit breakers act like safety nets - enabling autonomy while preve=
nting costly errors, rate bans, or compliance breaches. They=E2=80=99re not=
 necessarily permanent: as the agent proves reliable, you can widen thresho=
lds or retire specific checks.
The Trust Events That Matter
Through observation and experimentation, I've identified five critical "tru=
st events" that determine whether an agent successfully earns autonomy:
1. The First Failure How the agent handles its first significant error reve=
als its true reliability. Does it recognize the failure? Can it recover gra=
cefully? Does it learn from the mistake?
2. The Edge Case Test When confronted with scenarios outside its training d=
istribution, does the agent default to safe behavior or hallucinate solutio=
ns?
3. The Delegation Decision When the agent first decides to delegate to a hu=
man rather than guess, it demonstrates judgment beyond mere pattern matchin=
g.
4. The Consistency Check After 100, 1,000, or 10,000 operations, does perfo=
rmance remain stable or degrade? Consistency over time matters more than in=
itial accuracy.
5. The Audit Moment When you review the agent's historical decisions, do th=
ey make sense in retrospect? Can you understand its reasoning?
Teams that explicitly monitor and evaluate these trust events make better a=
utonomy decisions than those relying on aggregate metrics alone.
When Not to Use Guided Autonomy
Despite its benefits, Guided Autonomy isn't always the right approach. Skip=
 it when:
Stakes are permanently low: If errors don't matter, complex trust-building =
might be overkill
Full automation is impossible: Some tasks require human judgment that can't=
 be earned
Speed trumps safety: In true emergency scenarios, you might need to grant e=
mergency autonomy
Learning is the goal: Research environments where understanding limits matt=
ers more than production reliability
But these exceptions are rarer than most teams assume. Even "simple" tasks =
benefit from progressive trust-building.
The Path Forward: Building Your Trust Ladder
If you're building AI agents - and increasingly, who isn't? - here's how to=
 implement Guided Autonomy in your projects:
Step 1: Map your agency levels Define 3-5 clear autonomy levels for your us=
e case. Each should be measurably different from the others.
Step 2: Instrument everything You can't manage what you can't measure. Buil=
d observability from day one, not as an afterthought.
Step 3: Start lower than comfortable Your first deployment should feel almo=
st uselessly conservative. That's the point - you're building foundation, n=
ot showing off.
Step 4: Define graduation criteria Before deploying at any level, document =
exactly what success looks like and what earns advancement.
Step 5: Calibrate continuously Schedule regular reviews. Weekly at first, t=
hen monthly as patterns stabilize.
Step 6: Communicate transparently Users should understand what autonomy lev=
el they're interacting with and why.
The Compound Effect of Earned Trust
Something remarkable happens when you follow these principles: trust compou=
nds. Each successful interaction makes the next one more likely to succeed.=
 Users who see agents earn their autonomy become partners in the process ra=
ther than skeptics of the outcome.
A customer support team I worked with saw this firsthand. When they transpa=
rently showed customers that their AI agent was "Learning with your help," =
(Level 2) complaint rates dropped 60%. Customers became collaborators, prov=
iding feedback that accelerated the agent's advancement to Level 3.
This compound effect extends beyond individual agents. Organizations that s=
uccessfully implement Guided Autonomy for one use case find subsequent impl=
ementations easier. The framework becomes organizational muscle memory.
The Future of Human-Agent Collaboration
As I write this, we're at an inflection point. The next generation of AI ag=
ents will have capabilities we can only begin to imagine - multimodal under=
standing, complex reasoning, long-term memory, and sophisticated tool use. =
But capability without trust is just potential energy.
This framework isn't about limiting AI agents - on the contrary - it's abou=
t unlocking their full potential through systematic trust-building. It's th=
e difference between a powerful tool you're afraid to use and a reliable pa=
rtner you can't imagine working without.
The teams winning with AI agents aren't the ones building the most sophisti=
cated systems. They're the ones building trust systematically, earning auto=
nomy incrementally, and creating agents that users actually want to work wi=
th.
Your AI agents are capable of remarkable things. But first, they need to ea=
rn the right to show you. Start with the smallest useful autonomy. Measure =
everything. Advance based on evidence, not hope. Build trust through demons=
tration, not declaration.
The ladder is there. The only question is whether you'll help your agents c=
limb it.
What autonomy level are your AI agents operating at? Have you seen examples=
 of earned trust in action? I'd love to hear about your experiences impleme=
nting progressive autonomy.=20
If you found this framework useful, consider sharing it with your team. The=
 more organizations that adopt Guided Autonomy principles, the faster we'll=
 all move toward truly reliable AI agents.

 from the mistake?</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
