DAILY MEMO: US-CHINA TRADE DEAL, RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE TALKS [3]
WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, OBSTACLES REMAIN ON BOTH FRONTS.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
COMPROMISE. The United States and China agreed to slash duties on imports [4] for an initial 90-day period following high-level talks in Geneva over the weekend. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
said both sides would lower tariffs by 115 percent. (In April, the U.S. imposed 145 percent duties on Chinese goods, while China imposed 125 percent duties on some U.S. imports.) They also agreed to
establish a mechanism to continue talks on economic and trade relations.
MAKING PLANS. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed he would be willing to host Russia-Ukraine peace talks [5] in a call with President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan also spoke with French
President Emmanuel Macron about the matter. The conversations came after Putin proposed in a national address over the weekend direct talks with Kyiv beginning on May 15 in Istanbul. U.S. President
Donald Trump, who last week suggested a 30-day ceasefire, urged Kyiv to accept Putin’s proposal. In a social media post [6], Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would personally attend
the negotiations in Turkey and called for a ceasefire starting Monday. China, meanwhile, said it supports Trump’s proposal [7] for a 30-day ceasefire.
SECRET VISIT. Several Syrian officials visited Israel last month for unofficial meetings with Israeli defense officials, Israel’s Haaretz newspaper reported [8]. According to the story, the
delegation included a high-ranking intelligence official and representatives from Quneitra province, which borders Israel. Notably, Israel is also in talks with Turkey over managing their respective
activities in Syria.
PROMISING RETALIATION. Israel will take “unilateral actions” against states that independently recognize a Palestinian state, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said [9]. At a joint press
conference with his German counterpart in Jerusalem, he added that such initiatives were counterproductive and would actually damage relations between Israel and the Palestinians. His comments come
after French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Paris would move toward recognizing a Palestinian state in the coming months.
KURDS IN TURKEY. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) officially announced that it will disband and end its armed struggle against the Turkish state [10]. This comes after the PKK’s jailed leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, in February called on his supporters to lay down their arms after four decades of fighting for Kurdish autonomy. A spokesperson for Turkey’s governing AKP party said the move was an
important step toward achieving the goal of a “Turkey without terrorism.”
ADVANCING NEGOTIATIONS. The United States and Iran held their fourth round of talks [11] on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman over the weekend. A spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry
characterized the meeting as “difficult but useful” and confirmed that negotiations would continue, with Oman expected to soon announce details of the next round. Notably, Iranian Foreign Minister
Abbas Araghchi said Iran was prepared to adjust its uranium enrichment levels as a gesture of goodwill and that the next meeting is likely to occur within a week.
GROWING RIFT. Algeria on Sunday expelled two French diplomats [12], accusing them of being intelligence agents and holding “fake diplomatic passports.” Algeria’s state broadcaster reported that
the individuals worked for France’s Directorate of Internal Security and failed to comply with legal requirements upon entering the country. The move is part of a growing diplomatic spat between the
two countries. Algeria expelled 12 French embassy and consulate employees last month in response to the arrest in Paris of an Algerian diplomat suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an
Algerian opposition activist.
IRANIAN DIPLOMACY. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Saudi counterpart [13], Prince Faisal bin Farhan, during a one-day trip to Jeddah. At the meeting, Araghchi urged the Arab world
to make a “commitment to prevent genocide in the Gaza Strip” and informed bin Farhan about the progress in nuclear talks with the U.S. Araghchi also met over the weekend with the Qatari foreign
minister [14], Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, as part of the Iran-Arab World Dialogue summit in Doha. They discussed bilateral relations and regional developments, including the situation
in Gaza.
ENERGY COOPERATION. Vietnam and Russia have agreed to advance energy cooperation [15] following a meeting in Moscow between their leaders. They agreed to sign deals on building nuclear power plants in
Vietnam, which suspended its nuclear energy plans a decade ago, and pledged to increase Russian deliveries of crude oil and liquified natural gas to Vietnam.
DEFENSE PARTNERSHIP. Morocco and the Ivory Coast signed a military cooperation agreement [16] following a meeting between their defense ministers. The deal provides for cooperation on training,
military health development and technical assistance.
