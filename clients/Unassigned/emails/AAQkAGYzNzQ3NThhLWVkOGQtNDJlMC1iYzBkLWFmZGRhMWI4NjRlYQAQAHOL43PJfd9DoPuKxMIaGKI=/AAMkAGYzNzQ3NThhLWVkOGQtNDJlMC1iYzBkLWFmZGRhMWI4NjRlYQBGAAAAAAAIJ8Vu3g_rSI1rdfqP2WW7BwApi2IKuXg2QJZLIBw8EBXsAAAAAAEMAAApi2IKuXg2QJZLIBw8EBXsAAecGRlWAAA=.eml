Everyone loves Claude Skills!=20
The problem is that with all that attention we=E2=80=99ve discovered lots o=
f common teething issues, and that=E2=80=99s what this post is all about.
I went through my DMs and messages from the last week and found all the com=
mon issues with Claude Code:
Skills that won=E2=80=99t trigger
Issues with zip files
Context window overflows
Questions about security if Skills run code
Questions about how to evaluate Skills
The list goes on, and I decided to do something about it. So I sat down and=
 looked across the issues and realized what we need is really a building ki=
t for Claude Skills.=20
A set of tools that we can go back to to build skills with confidence, to t=
roubleshoot them, etc.=20
Plus, we needed a clear guide with common pitfalls and tips and tricks, gro=
unded in hard and real experience.
I wrote both. I wrote a guide for the common pitfalls and and I wrote 10 qu=
ick Claude Skills tools to help you get the most out of this powerful new t=
ool. (And if you=E2=80=99re still wondering what Claude Skills are, check o=
ut my intro post on that  [ https://substack.com/redirect/6186ec00-e2f3-439=
4-8ec8-beb2fe3e8930?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6Rx=
Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ]from last week.)
Here=E2=80=99s what I built:
skill-debugging-assistant - Fixes skills that won=E2=80=99t trigger
skill-security-analyzer - Audits third-party skills for malicious code
skill-gap-analyzer - Identifies missing skills from repeated explanations
skill-performance-profiler - Shows which skills waste tokens
prompt-optimization-analyzer - Catches bad descriptions before deployment
skill-testing-framework - Runs automated tests after changes
skill-doc-generator - Creates consistent documentation across your library
skill-dependency-mapper - Shows how skills interact and bottleneck
learning-capture - Identifies patterns worth turning into skills
token-budget-advisor - Tackles context limits with chunking strategies
If this is looking a little familiar, it should. This is the so-called bori=
ng toolset that treats Skills like what they are: code we can read in plain=
 English.
I=E2=80=99ve been saying for months now that we should treat our prompts as=
 code. As I wrote last week, Skills are super-leveraged prompts. Well, they=
=E2=80=99re code too!=20
But I know we all don=E2=80=99t have a ton of time, and we really just need=
 to be able to build our own Skills for what we need and be confident they =
work.=20
That=E2=80=99s exactly what this kit is for! It gives you everything you ne=
ed to build the Skills you want with confidence=E2=80=94plus I show you two=
 end-to-end examples in the video so you can see how I do it.
It has never been a better time to work using AI. Skills give us 10x levera=
ge=E2=80=94I use them every day. I want you to have the same tools I have t=
o build the Skills YOU want.
Have fun, and happy building!

These nine meta-skills solve a different class of problem than typical skil=
ls. Instead of helping you create presentations or analyze spreadsheets, th=
ey provide infrastructure for your entire skills ecosystem.=20
They debug why skills don=E2=80=99t trigger, audit security risks before yo=
u run community skills, identify gaps in your coverage, optimize token usag=
e, automate testing, and generate consistent documentation.=20
The most interesting one=E2=80=94learning-capture=E2=80=94watches your work=
 and identifies patterns worth formalizing into new skills, making Claude a=
n active participant in its own improvement.=20
Together, they turn skills from a collection of tools into a self-maintaini=
ng system. You don=E2=80=99t need all nine immediately, but each one addres=
ses a specific pain point that breaks at scale: routing failures, security =
concerns, version chaos, token waste, and the constant question of =E2=80=
=9Cwhat should I build next?=E2=80=9D They=E2=80=99re the infrastructure la=
yer most people aren=E2=80=99t building yet, but probably should be.
Note: these are .skill files, which means they work natively with Claude, a=
nd if you tell ChatGPT they are zip files ChatGPT swears a bit and opens th=
em up nicely.

This guide covers everything you need to know to use Claude Skills effectiv=
ely across all platforms=E2=80=94Code, Web/Desktop, and API. It addresses t=
he 10 most common mistakes people hit in the first week (from forgetting to=
 enable Code Execution to version chaos across platforms), explains how to =
set up skills for each distribution method, and provides best practices tha=
t actually scale (treat skills like code, design for routing explicitly, au=
tomate testing).=20
It also introduces the meta-skills layer: infrastructure skills that debug =
other skills, analyze security risks, identify coverage gaps, optimize perf=
ormance, and even capture patterns from your work to recommend new skills.=
=20
Whether you=E2=80=99re an individual developer using Code with git, a team =
manually distributing ZIPs, or a product team integrating skills via API, t=
his guide provides the practical workflows, troubleshooting steps, and auto=
mation strategies you need. Bookmark this=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the referenc=
e you=E2=80=99ll come back to when something breaks or you=E2=80=99re setti=
ng up skills infrastructure for the first time.
I Built Meta-Skills to Fix What Broke about Claude Skills in Week One
Skills launched last week and my DMs exploded. Not with excitement=E2=80=94=
with confusion. The same problems kept surfacing: =E2=80=9CMy skill won=E2=
=80=99t trigger.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI uploaded it but nothing happens.=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9CWhich version am I actually running?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CIs this=
 safe to use?=E2=80=9D People understood the concept but were hitting the s=
ame walls repeatedly. Instead of answering the same questions individually,=
 I did what anyone with a pattern recognition problem does: I built infrast=
ructure to solve it systematically.
I built 10 meta-skills=E2=80=94skills specifically designed to help you bui=
ld, debug, test, and optimize other skills. They address the exact pain poi=
nts I watched the community hit in week one. This isn=E2=80=99t about what =
skills can do in theory. This is about what actually broke in practice, and=
 how to fix it.
What Actually Trips People Up
After a week of DMs and watching people struggle in public forums, the fail=
ure modes are consistent. Here are the 10 things that keep breaking:
Platform packaging confusion. Skills have one format but three completely d=
ifferent distribution modes. Claude Code reads skills directly from folders=
 on disk. Web and Desktop require ZIP files uploaded through Settings. The =
API uses /v1/skills endpoints with programmatic versioning. People expect o=
ne method to work everywhere=E2=80=94it doesn=E2=80=99t. You=E2=80=99ll wri=
te a skill once and then fight three different packaging workflows.
Code execution isn=E2=80=99t enabled. This is the number one silent failure=
=2E Your skill uploads correctly, shows=
 up in your library, but nothing happe=
ns when you try to use it. The toggle wasn=E2=80=99t on. Settings =E2=86=92=
 Features =E2=86=92 Code Execution =E2=86=92 On. Without it, skills are dec=
oration.
Skills don=E2=80=99t trigger when expected. Claude decides which skill to i=
nvoke based on your description and context. Vague descriptions mean Claude=
 picks the wrong skill or no skill at all. The first paragraph of your SKIL=
L.md matters more than anything else=E2=80=94if the router can=E2=80=99t di=
stinguish your skills in three seconds of scanning, you=E2=80=99re going to=
 have invocation problems.
Version chaos across surfaces. You iterate fast in Code, forget to package =
a ZIP, then wonder why the web version isn=E2=80=99t working. Your local sk=
ills are ahead of your ZIP in the web app, and if you=E2=80=99re also using=
 the API, you=E2=80=99ve got three versions of the same thing living in par=
allel. Without a source of truth, you=E2=80=99re constantly debugging =E2=
=80=9Cwhich version am I actually running?=E2=80=9D
Missing skill IDs from the API. If you=E2=80=99re using /v1/skills endpoint=
s, you need to save the skill_id that gets generated. Otherwise you=E2=80=
=99re recreating the same skill over and over, wasting API calls and breaki=
ng references. The API gives you an ID=E2=80=94capture it, store it, use it=
=2E
No team distribution. There=E2=80=99s no =E2=80=9Cpush to everyone=E2=80=9D=
 button. Each person uploads their own ZIP in Web/Desktop. For teams, this =
means either using Code with git-based distribution (everyone pulls and get=
s skills automatically) or using the API from your backend to attach skills=
 consistently.
Security assumptions. Skills run in a sandbox through Claude=E2=80=99s code=
 execution environment, but you=E2=80=99re still responsible for everything=
 you put in them. Downloading third-party skills from GitHub without review=
ing them means accepting code you haven=E2=80=99t audited. That code will r=
un with whatever permissions Claude=E2=80=99s execution environment has.
Marketplace misunderstanding. When docs mention a =E2=80=9Cmarketplace,=E2=
=80=9D that=E2=80=99s Claude Code only. Web and Desktop don=E2=80=99t have =
a marketplace=E2=80=94you upload manually. People expect centralized discov=
ery across all platforms. It doesn=E2=80=99t exist.
Too many overlapping skills. The router prefers narrow intent over flexibil=
ity. When you have one mega-skill trying to handle presentations, design te=
mplates, brand guidelines, and data visualization, the router has no idea w=
hen to use it. Better to split into focused skills: one for pitch decks, on=
e for branded presentations, one for data-heavy slides.
Documentation fragmentation. Instructions for Code are in one place, Web/De=
sktop uploads in another, API details somewhere else. None of them cross-re=
ference. People think features work across all platforms=E2=80=94they don=
=E2=80=99t. You end up re-googling the same URLs constantly.
These aren=E2=80=99t edge cases. These are the default experience for anyon=
e building skills seriously.
The Distribution Problem Specifically
The core confusion that trips everyone up: skills have one format but three=
 completely different distribution modes. You write them once=E2=80=94a fol=
der containing a SKILL.md file with your instructions=E2=80=94but getting t=
hem into Claude depends on which version you=E2=80=99re using.
Claude Code (the terminal tool for developers) reads skills directly from d=
isk. Drop a folder into ~/.claude/skills or your project=E2=80=99s .claude/=
skills/ directory, and it=E2=80=99s live. This is by far the cleanest appro=
ach. If you=E2=80=99re working with a team and your skills are in git, ever=
yone gets them automatically when they pull. No upload step, no manual dist=
ribution, just version control doing what it does.
Side note for non-technical readers: I need to use some technical terms her=
e throughout the article. You can ask ChatGPT to explain it to you and that=
 will help.
For example, I asked ChatGPT to explain the technical paragraph above like =
I=E2=80=99m a non-technical 12th grader, and this is what it said:
Claude Code is a command-line tool (like a text-based app for developers). =
It looks for =E2=80=9Cskills=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 basically little programs o=
r files that teach it new tricks =E2=80=94 in a specific folder on your com=
puter.
If you drop a folder of skills into one of these spots:
your main ~/.claude/skills folder (the default place Claude looks), or
the .claude/skills folder inside your current project,
Claude instantly sees and loads them =E2=80=94 no setup needed.
If you=E2=80=99re on a team and your code is stored in Git (a tool that tra=
cks changes in shared projects), everyone automatically gets the same skill=
s when they sync their work. That means you don=E2=80=99t need to upload an=
ything or share files manually =E2=80=94 Git handles it for you.
In short: put your skill files in the right folder, and they just work for =
everyone.
The web app and Claude Desktop, though, require ZIP files uploaded through =
Settings =E2=86=92 Capabilities =E2=86=92 Skills. Every time you update a s=
kill, you need a new ZIP and a new upload. This creates version drift immed=
iately. Your local skills in Code are ahead of your ZIP in the web app, and=
 if you=E2=80=99re also using the API (which has its own versioning system =
via /v1/skills endpoints), you=E2=80=99ve got three versions of the same th=
ing living in parallel.
The single biggest mistake I made early on was not picking a source of trut=
h. I=E2=80=99d iterate fast in Code, forget to package a ZIP, then wonder w=
hy the web version wasn=E2=80=99t working. Eventually I built a GitHub Acti=
on that packages ZIPs and registers skills with the API on every tag. It=E2=
=80=99s not glamorous but it prevents the =E2=80=9Cwhich version am I actua=
lly running=E2=80=9D confusion that eats up way too much mental energy.
So I Built Infrastructure
Instead of explaining these pitfalls individually in DMs, I built meta-skil=
ls to address them systematically. These aren=E2=80=99t task-specific skill=
s like =E2=80=9Ccreate a pitch deck=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Canalyze a spreadsh=
eet.=E2=80=9D These are skills about skills=E2=80=94infrastructure for debu=
gging, testing, optimizing, and evolving your entire skills library.
I now have 10 meta-skills running. Each one solves a specific pain point I =
watched people hit repeatedly:
skill-debugging-assistant for when skills don=E2=80=99t trigger or behave u=
nexpectedly
skill-security-analyzer for auditing skills before you run them
skill-gap-analyzer for identifying what your library is missing
skill-performance-profiler for tracking token usage and invocation patterns
prompt-optimization-analyzer for reviewing skill descriptions before deploy=
ment
skill-testing-framework for automated validation of skill behavior
skill-doc-generator for standardized documentation across your library
skill-dependency-mapper for understanding how skills interact
learning-capture for identifying patterns worth formalizing into new skills
The last one=E2=80=94learning-capture=E2=80=94is the most interesting, and =
I don=E2=80=99t think anyone else is doing this yet.
The Meta-Skills Layer
Here=E2=80=99s how each meta-skill directly addresses what breaks in practi=
ce:
When Skills Don=E2=80=99t Trigger: skill-debugging-assistant
The most common DM: =E2=80=9CI built a skill but Claude isn=E2=80=99t using=
 it.=E2=80=9D The debugging assistant analyzes your SKILL.md for trigger fa=
ilures, parameter problems, and prompt conflicts. It checks YAML frontmatte=
r, validates descriptions against routing best practices, examines progress=
ive disclosure structure, and identifies absolute statements that might cau=
se conflicts with system instructions.
It caught an issue with my vibe-coding skill (for building apps with Cursor=
 and Lovable) getting invoked when I asked about Excel formulas. The descri=
ption mentioned =E2=80=9Cdevelopment=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctools,=E2=80=9D =
which was enough to confuse the router. The debugging assistant flagged the=
 overlap and suggested more adversarial specificity: not just =E2=80=9Cwhat=
 this does=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Cwhen to use this, when NOT to use this, wh=
at inputs it expects, what outputs it produces, and what it explicitly does=
n=E2=80=99t handle.=E2=80=9D
When You=E2=80=99re Worried About Security: skill-security-analyzer
Third-party skills are code. You=E2=80=99re accepting arbitrary execution w=
ithout review unless you explicitly audit them. The security analyzer runs =
comprehensive risk analysis: checks for dependency vulnerabilities, evaluat=
es code execution patterns, assesses data handling, validates input sanitiz=
ation, and flags potential malicious behavior.
I treat skills like dependencies now. Before I add one, I run it through th=
e security analyzer. If it flags concerns I don=E2=80=99t understand, I don=
=E2=80=99t use it. I also maintain a SECURITY.md file for each skill docume=
nting what capabilities it needs and what risks it introduces. This isn=E2=
=80=99t paranoia=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s hygiene. The skills model is powerful=
 precisely because it can execute arbitrary code. That power requires you t=
o be deliberate about what you enable.
When You Don=E2=80=99t Know What to Build: skill-gap-analyzer
=E2=80=9CWhat skills should I even create?=E2=80=9D The gap analyzer review=
s your entire skills library and identifies coverage gaps based on common w=
orkflows. It analyzes patterns across your conversations, looks for repeate=
d explanations that burn context window tokens, and recommends specific ski=
lls that would have high ROI.
It told me I was repeatedly explaining how to read research papers, walking=
 through the same methodology each time. I formalized that into the researc=
h-paper-reader skill. It caught that I was re-explaining agentic developmen=
t best practices constantly. That became the agentic-development skill. The=
 gap analyzer doesn=E2=80=99t just identify holes=E2=80=94it quantifies the=
 token savings you=E2=80=99d get by filling them.
When You=E2=80=99re Burning Tokens: skill-performance-profiler and token-bu=
dget-advisor
The performance profiler tracks which skills are heavy on tokens and which =
get invoked frequently. It measures token consumption per invocation, ident=
ifies expensive skills that might need optimization, and detects skills tha=
t aren=E2=80=99t getting used at all (candidates for removal).
The token-budget-advisor goes further: it proactively assesses token consum=
ption risk before you even start a task. When you=E2=80=99re uploading mult=
iple large files or asking for comprehensive multi-document analysis, it ev=
aluates whether the task will strain the context window and recommends spec=
ific chunking strategies.
I built the powerpoint-chunker skill in response to community feedback abou=
t hitting context limits on presentation-heavy tasks. Instead of creating a=
 40-slide deck in one shot and running out of tokens, the chunker breaks th=
e work into phases: outline first, then 10 slides at a time, with reviews b=
etween chunks. The token-budget-advisor identifies when you need this appro=
ach before you waste tokens finding out the hard way.
When Your Descriptions Are Bad: prompt-optimization-analyzer
Writing good skill descriptions is harder than it looks. The prompt-optimiz=
ation-analyzer reviews new skills for token waste, anti-patterns, and trigg=
er issues before you commit them. It identifies vague language, catches mis=
sing negative examples, flags overly broad descriptions, and suggests speci=
fic improvements with examples.
I learned to avoid the =E2=80=9Cmega-skill=E2=80=9D temptation the hard way=
=2E When you have one skill trying to h=
andle presentation creation, design te=
mplates, brand guidelines, and data visualization, the router has no idea w=
hen to use it. The prompt-optimization-analyzer caught this pattern and rec=
ommended splitting into focused skills: one for pitch decks, one for brande=
d presentations, one for data-heavy slides. The router prefers narrow inten=
t over flexibility.
When You Need Quality Assurance: skill-testing-framework
=E2=80=9CHow do I know if my skill actually works?=E2=80=9D The testing fra=
mework provides structured validation: unit tests for individual skill comp=
onents, integration tests for multi-skill workflows, regression tests after=
 updates, and input/output pair validation against expected results.
I have a small set of test prompts for each skill that should trigger invoc=
ation and produce expected outputs. These run in CI on every change. When a=
 skill stops getting invoked correctly or produces wrong results, the tests=
 catch it before I notice in production. This is especially important for s=
kills with overlapping domains=E2=80=94the eval harness proves they=E2=80=
=99re distinct.
When You Need Documentation: skill-doc-generator
Maintaining consistent documentation across my 19 skills is tedious. The do=
c-generator auto-generates standardized README files from SKILL.md frontmat=
ter, validates consistency (terminology, structure, formatting), creates us=
age examples, and identifies documentation gaps.
Every skill in my library has standardized documentation now. The doc-gener=
ator ensures I=E2=80=99m not reinventing formats, catches inconsistencies, =
and makes the library navigable. When someone asks =E2=80=9Cwhat does your =
xlsx-editor skill do differently from complex-excel-builder?=E2=80=9D the d=
ocumentation is clear because it was generated from a consistent template.
When You Need to Understand Dependencies: skill-dependency-mapper
As your skills library grows, understanding how skills interact becomes cri=
tical. The dependency mapper analyzes the ecosystem to visualize dependenci=
es, identify workflow bottlenecks, and recommend optimal skill stacks for d=
ifferent tasks.
It showed me that six of my skills depend on outputs from the gap-analyzer,=
 making it a bottleneck. If the gap-analyzer breaks, half my meta-infrastru=
cture fails. That insight pushed me to add better error handling and fallba=
cks. The mapper also identifies skills that should work together but don=E2=
=80=99t=E2=80=94opportunities to improve integration.
The Recursive Layer: learning-capture
This is the meta-skill that changes everything. Instead of manually decidin=
g when to create new skills, learning-capture watches your work sessions an=
d recognizes when you=E2=80=99ve solved something the same way twice or bui=
lt up complex domain knowledge across multiple conversations.
When it sees high-ROI patterns (things that will save 500+ tokens per reuse=
 across 10+ future conversations), it offers to formalize them into a new s=
kill. I=E2=80=99ve created four skills this way that I would never have tho=
ught to write manually. It recognized my repeated explanations about requir=
ements elicitation from product docs=E2=80=94that became a skill. It caught=
 my pattern of walking through pitch deck narrative development=E2=80=94tha=
t became another skill.
The learning-capture skill makes Claude actively participate in its own imp=
rovement. Instead of just using skills, I=E2=80=99m curating and evolving a=
n ecosystem. It=E2=80=99s the difference between having a collection of scr=
ipts and having infrastructure you maintain.
What Actually Works at Scale
After building 19 skills and using them daily for just under a week, a few =
patterns have emerged that seem to generalize.=20
I should note this is most helpfully applied to the practical skills you bu=
ild with meta-skills such as those I=E2=80=99m sharing=E2=80=94if you=E2=80=
=99re building all this stuff into meta-skills you=E2=80=99re probably shav=
ing the yak [ https://substack.com/redirect/302d213c-1d70-41d3-9cca-f38c01a=
15d69?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
=2E So think of these rules of thumb as=
 more and more applicable as you build=
 with skills more and more seriously.
First, treat skills like code from day one. Version them with semver, write=
 changelogs, review changes before deploying. I keep all my skills in a mon=
orepo with a /skills/ directory containing one folder per skill. A simple G=
itHub Action packages ZIPs, uploads to the API, and writes back the skill_i=
d to a JSON map. This makes rollbacks trivial and gives me a clear history =
of what changed when.
Second, design for routing explicitly. Every skill needs negative examples =
in its description=E2=80=94not just what it does, but what it doesn=E2=80=
=99t do. =E2=80=9CDo not use this for financial modeling, compliance docume=
nts, or multi-tab workbooks=E2=80=9D isn=E2=80=99t fluff, it=E2=80=99s rout=
er guidance. Include concrete input contracts and examples of when the skil=
l should fire. The router is pattern-matching against your description, so =
give it unambiguous signals.
Third, build eval harnesses before you need them. I have a small set of tes=
t prompts for each skill that should trigger invocation and produce expecte=
d outputs. These run in CI on every change. When a skill stops getting invo=
ked correctly or produces wrong results, the tests catch it before I notice=
 in production. This is especially important for skills with overlapping do=
mains=E2=80=94the eval harness proves they=E2=80=99re distinct.
Fourth, name skills by job-to-be-done, not by team or person. =E2=80=9Cppt_=
brand_apac=E2=80=9D tells you exactly what it=E2=80=99s for. =E2=80=9Cmarke=
ting_team_helper=E2=80=9D tells you nothing. Keep each skill single-purpose=
=2E If you need multiple capabilities,=20=
create multiple skills and compose the=
m. The router handles composition better than you can handle mega-skills.
Fifth, prefer the API for distribution if you=E2=80=99re working with a tea=
m. Authoring happens fastest in Code (tight loop, local files), but publish=
ing via the API gives you IDs, versions, and rollback capabilities. Your ap=
p or orchestrator can attach skills consistently across all users without m=
anual uploads.
The Compounding Effect
Here=E2=80=99s what I think gets under-sold: skills compound. Each new skil=
l makes it easier to build the next one. The skill-doc-generator creates st=
andardized documentation from my SKILL.md files, ensuring consistency acros=
s the library. The prompt-optimization-analyzer reviews new skills for toke=
n waste and anti-patterns before I commit them. The learning-capture skill =
identifies patterns worth formalizing while I work.
The token economics also compound. Each skill I add reduces the amount of r=
e-explanation needed in future conversations. My context windows are cleane=
r because specialized knowledge lives in skills rather than being re-loaded=
 every conversation. For tasks that used to require multiple back-and-forth=
 clarifications, the right skill makes the first response correct.
I=E2=80=99m not claiming skills are transformative for everyone. If you=E2=
=80=99re mostly using Claude for one-off questions or casual conversation, =
the overhead isn=E2=80=99t worth it. But if you=E2=80=99re using Claude for=
 recurring work=E2=80=94especially work that requires specialized knowledge=
 or consistent methodology=E2=80=94skills shift the economics dramatically.=
 The setup cost amortizes quickly when you=E2=80=99re no longer burning tok=
ens re-explaining yourself.
The meta-skills ecosystem in particular feels under-explored. Skills for an=
alyzing skills, for generating skills from examples, for testing skills, fo=
r documenting skills=E2=80=94this recursive layer turns skills from a colle=
ction of tools into a living system. I suspect the most valuable skills won=
=E2=80=99t be task-specific ones but the ones that make other skills better=
=2E
Start Small
If you=E2=80=99re thinking about building skills, start small. Pick one tas=
k you do repeatedly and formalize it. Don=E2=80=99t overthink the infrastru=
cture initially=E2=80=94just create a folder with SKILL.md and get it worki=
ng in Code. The sophistication can come later, after you=E2=80=99ve felt th=
e benefit of having one skill that actually makes your life easier.
Once you have two or three working skills, that=E2=80=99s when the meta-lay=
er starts making sense. Add the debugging assistant when you hit your first=
 =E2=80=9Cwhy isn=E2=80=99t this triggering?=E2=80=9D moment. Add the secur=
ity analyzer before you start using community skills. Add the gap analyzer =
when you=E2=80=99re wondering what to build next.
The rest compounds from there. Each meta-skill makes the next skill easier =
to build. The infrastructure becomes self-reinforcing. What surprised me mo=
st is how much clearer my thinking about AI usage became after building ski=
lls. Creating a skill forces you to formalize your mental model of a task. =
You can=E2=80=99t write good trigger descriptions unless you understand exa=
ctly when the skill should and shouldn=E2=80=99t apply.
I don=E2=80=99t know if my skills library is =E2=80=9Cgood=E2=80=9D in any =
objective sense, because we=E2=80=99re all writing the rules together. I th=
ink it=E2=80=99s useful. I think it=E2=80=99s needed now, and that why I=E2=
=80=99m sharing it here. For now, it works for how I think, and it makes Cl=
aude substantially more useful for my work. That=E2=80=99s enough for me, a=
nd I hope it helps you!
Where can I learn more?
