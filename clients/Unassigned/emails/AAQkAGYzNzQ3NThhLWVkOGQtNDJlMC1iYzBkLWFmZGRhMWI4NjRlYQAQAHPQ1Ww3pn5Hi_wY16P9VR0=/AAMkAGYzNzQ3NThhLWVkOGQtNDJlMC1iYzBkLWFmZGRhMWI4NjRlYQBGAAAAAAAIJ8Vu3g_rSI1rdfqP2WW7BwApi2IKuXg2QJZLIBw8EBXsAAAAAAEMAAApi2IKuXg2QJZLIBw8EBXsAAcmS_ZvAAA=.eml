Yes I know we just got done introducing Chain-of-Thought prompting as a con=
cept a few months ago, and now we=E2=80=99re moving on. Welcome to AI!=20
Why is this not Chain-of-Thought (CoT) all dressed up? Well, the idea behin=
d CoT was always that you could teach a non-reasoning model to simulate rea=
soning and that could lead to better outcomes in many cases. Great! So far =
so good.=20
But now there is widespread access to reasoning models, particularly o3, o4=
-mini-high, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. And those models do better without being re=
minded to think. They already know how.
Something popped out to me though=E2=80=94these models know how to think, b=
ut we don=E2=80=99t have a common language for telling them how to direct t=
heir thinking, how to aim their thinking in ways that are useful to us.=20
I=E2=80=99ve touched on some of the prompting steps I=E2=80=99ll outline he=
re in a couple of previous posts [ https://substack.com/redirect/0c587500-c=
d05-4556-9722-a8a372d255e3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7B=
DnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], but I realized that the power of Chain-of-Refinement=
 (CoR) was sort of slipping by most folks. How is it different than Chain-o=
f-Thought again? Why bother? Is it worth it?
I=E2=80=99ll cut to the chase: It=E2=80=99s the kind of thing that saves yo=
u hours of editing and yelling about =E2=80=9CAI slop.=E2=80=9D It=E2=80=99=
s absolutely worth it. And no, it doesn=E2=80=99t take away your thinking p=
owers.=20
You need extra precision and refinement of thinking to guide this process, =
because you=E2=80=99re essentially guiding a step above where you would nor=
mally be thinking=E2=80=94you are meta-prompting. You=E2=80=99re asking the=
 model to move a concept you have through latent space and re-process it in=
 multiple steps that are useful to you with checkpoints along the way=E2=80=
=A6=20
The only way it will get all that right is if you have thought deeply about=
 what you want, and if you=E2=80=99ve framed your input materials carefully=
=2E In other words, this is not an invitation to turn off your brain!=20
If this seems abstract, don=E2=80=99t worry. I have five sample prompts bel=
ow that make it concrete, plus guardrails and specific use-cases where this=
 kind of approach helps. Once you grasp the idea, it=E2=80=99s super easy t=
o apply and it really can help save you hours a week (and clear the calenda=
r) as you work through complex thinking tasks more quickly.
Most importantly, it focuses your brain where it should be focused=E2=80=94=
on the gaps and challenges in your thinking line, and how to close them mos=
t usefully. Read on to turn the lead (of meetings and slow process) into go=
ld (quicker turns, less back-and-forth in slack, smarter thinking).
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Teaching the model to argue with itself
You already ask ChatGPT for summaries and rewrites, but you may have missed=
 its real super-power: it can argue with itself, fast. Give the model permi=
ssion to think, then critique its own work, then refine the draft=E2=80=94a=
nd you swap half-day meetings for a two-pass loop that takes about as long =
as topping up your coffee.
This isn=E2=80=99t generic =E2=80=9CAI writing.=E2=80=9D It only clicks whe=
n the model can hold a deep reasoning chain. In practice that means OpenAI =
o3 and o4-mini-high, or Google=E2=80=99s Gemini 2.5 Pro. With careful chain=
-of-thought prompting you can coax similar behaviour from other LLMs, but s=
maller or heavily-guarded models tend to drop the thread.
Why does the loop feel almost unfairly fast? Because many product tasks=E2=
=80=94root-cause analyses, OKR drafts, build-vs-buy matrices=E2=80=94alread=
y live in neat, labeled buckets. Feed those =E2=80=9Ctokenizable=E2=80=9D c=
hunks in, let the model interrogate its own output, and the gaps light up i=
mmediately. The trick isn=E2=80=99t replacing human thinking; it=E2=80=99s =
packaging your thinking so the model can sprint instead of shuffle.
Stick around for four minutes and I=E2=80=99ll show you the exact prompts, =
the model settings that matter, and the red-flags to watch for when the loo=
p goes off the rails.
How =E2=80=9CTokenizable Thinking=E2=80=9D Turns a Model into Its Own Edito=
r
Large language models reason in tokens=E2=80=94chunks of text they manipula=
te one step at a time. When your task is already broken into named fields (=
timeline, metric, owner, hypothesis =E2=80=A6), each field becomes a tidy c=
ontainer the model can grab, inspect, and improve without losing track of t=
he rest. That=E2=80=99s what I mean by tokenizable thinking: you hand the m=
odel structured information instead of a wall of prose, and it can move thr=
ough the reasoning like cells in a spreadsheet rather than paragraphs in a =
novel.
Here=E2=80=99s why that matters for the Think =E2=86=92 Critique =E2=86=92 =
Refine loop:
Think =E2=80=93 The model fills every field once, producing a first-pass ar=
tifact (a PRD, a risk matrix, a 5-Whys table). Because the schema is explic=
it, it knows where each idea belongs.
Critique =E2=80=93 You ask the same model to evaluate its own draft field b=
y field: =E2=80=9CWhich goals are vague?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhich risks lack=
 owners?=E2=80=9D The structured view lets it pinpoint gaps instead of wavi=
ng at =E2=80=9Coverall clarity.=E2=80=9D
Refine =E2=80=93 Armed with that checklist, the model rewrites only the sec=
tions that failed inspection, leaving the solid parts untouched. The schema=
 keeps it from rearranging the furniture.
The net effect is velocity: the model doesn=E2=80=99t wander or forget cont=
ext, so two passes usually reach publish-ready quality. But speed depends o=
n how clearly you frame the problem. Feed sloppy notes, get sloppy gaps; ma=
sk your real goal behind fuzzy verbs, and the loop stalls. Think of the mod=

useless at guessing what you forgot to mention. Provide the structure, and =
it will do in seconds what used to take you a meeting and a half.
Picking the Right Model (and Rescuing the Rest)
The Think =E2=86=92 Critique =E2=86=92 Refine loop leans hard on a model=E2=
=80=99s ability to hold a detailed chain of thought without getting lost or=
 throttling itself. In practice, three current models clear that bar with r=
oom to spare:
OpenAI o3 =E2=80=93 The =E2=80=9Creasoning-first=E2=80=9D version of GPT-4o=
=2E It keeps long logical threads in=
tact, so the critique pass doesn=E2=80=99=
t dissolve into platitudes, and the refine pass lands specific fixes instea=
d of rewrites-from-scratch=E2=80=94often in under ten seconds.
OpenAI o4-mini-high =E2=80=93 Slightly slower but with a deeper context win=
dow and tighter factual precision, useful when your input bundle is pages o=
f logs or a multi-table trade-off matrix.
Google Gemini 2.5 Pro =E2=80=93 Comparable context length, plus painless JS=
ON output for the structured artifacts this loop thrives on; especially han=
dy if you prefer the PaLM-style =E2=80=9Creason step-by-step (don=E2=80=99t=
 show your work)=E2=80=9D prompt pattern.
Could you run the loop on something smaller=E2=80=94GPT-3.5 Turbo, Mistral-=
8x7B, Claude Haiku? Yes, but expect friction. These models either truncate =
their own reasoning or decline to critique themselves honestly. Your best w=
orkaround is to break the loop into separate calls:
Draft call =E2=80=93 model produces the artifact.
Critique call =E2=80=93 you feed that artifact into a fresh prompt that ins=
tructs explicit, numbered feedback.
Refine call =E2=80=93 you pass both the original and the feedback back in f=
or fixes.
The triple-call pattern costs a few cents more and doubles latency, but it =
restores most of the quality=E2=80=94provided you keep the task narrow (=E2=
=89=A4=E2=80=89300 tokens input, =E2=89=A4=E2=80=891 k tokens total context=
) and supply a crystal-clear schema.
Two practical tips when you=E2=80=99re testing models:
Hide the chain of thought. Most providers forbid showing raw reasoning in t=
he final answer. Wrap it in internal instructions (=E2=80=9CThink step-by-s=
tep, then present only the revised artifact=E2=80=9D).
Anchor the schema. Paste a tiny example table or JSON block in every prompt=
=2E Without it, smaller models drift; e=
ven o3 benefits from the visual cue.
Bottom line: if you have o3, o4-mini-high, or Gemini 2.5 Pro at your finger=
tips, the loop feels like cheating. If you don=E2=80=99t, you can still get=
 80 % of the benefit=E2=80=94just be ready to hold its hand a little more a=
nd keep the problems bite-sized.

Using Smaller Models?
If you=E2=80=99re limited to GPT-4o or are using another non-reasoning mode=
l, break each loop into three separate chats. You=E2=80=99ll keep most of t=
he quality; you=E2=80=99ll just wait a few extra seconds, and you=E2=80=99l=
l have to adjust your prompting a bit depending on how the model outputs. Y=
ou may need to mix some Chain-of-Thought prompting in to get the model to a=
ctually reason through each step.
Making It Stick: Why Framing and Source Material Trump Raw Model Power
A strong =E2=80=9CThink =E2=86=92 Critique =E2=86=92 Refine=E2=80=9D loop i=
s never a shortcut around human judgment=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s an amplifier =
of the clarity you feed it. Hand the model scattered thoughts and you=E2=80=
=99ll get polished-looking nonsense. Hand it a well-labeled bundle of facts=
 and constraints and it will surface blind spots faster than any whiteboard=
 session.
Start with structure. Every prompt in the last section begins by pinning do=
wn fields (metric, baseline, owner) or table columns (Stage, Goal, Friction=
). That scaffolding turns free-form ideas into tokens the model can reason =
over one by one. Skip the scaffolding and the model is forced to guess what=
 matters, usually badly.
Next, give it ground truth. Paste the relevant excerpts=E2=80=94meeting not=
es, logs, survey quotes=E2=80=94right under the prompt, and cite them in th=
e instructions (=E2=80=9Cuse bracket tags like [Notes #12]=E2=80=9D). When =
the model critiques its own draft, those tags anchor each claim to a real l=
ine of evidence, making hallucinations obvious and easy to fix.
Finally, check the instruction hygiene. Vague verbs (=E2=80=9Cimprove,=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9Coptimize,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cshorten but keep detail=E2=80=
=9D) pull the loop off course. Instead, tell the model exactly which tests =
to run on itself: =E2=80=9Cflag any metric that lacks a baseline,=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9Chighlight duplicate stages,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cmark confidence High=
 / Medium / Low.=E2=80=9D If you can=E2=80=99t specify a rule in plain Engl=
ish, refine your own thinking first=E2=80=94the loop will only move as fast=
 as the problem is framed.
In practice, teams that adopt this discipline see two clear signals of succ=
ess: (1) the critique section turns up clearer and more interesting gaps, b=
ecause inputs arrive cleaner and more complete, and (2) the refine pass pro=
vides really useful options for addressing those thinking gaps. At that poi=
nt you=E2=80=99re no longer wrestling with drafts; you=E2=80=99re accelerat=
ing through a normal team refinement process in less than 12 parsecs [ http=
s://substack.com/redirect/9822a7e5-b199-45e5-b065-b7a503680587?j=3DeyJ1Ijoi=

re laser focused on the gaps in your thinking and inputs=E2=80=94and how to=
 close them. That=E2=80=99s real leverage.
Guardrails That Actually Matter
The loop=E2=80=99s speed is seductive, but it only pays off when you bracke=
t it with disciplined inputs and a clear destination. In practice these thr=
ee guardrails are enough to keep you aimed in the right direction as you st=
art practicing CoR on your own.
1. Curate the source, don=E2=80=99t dump the junk.
Feed the model the cleanest slice of reality you can: the definitive incide=
nt timeline, not the full Slack flame-thread; the final design constraints,=
 not half-baked Figma comments. If the input reads like a rummage drawer, t=
he model=E2=80=99s critique phase will waste tokens pointing out obvious me=
ss instead of surfacing real blind spots. A minute of human triage up front=
 is worth dozens of passes later.
2. Frame the problem before you press =E2=80=9Csend.=E2=80=9D
Think through what success looks like=E2=80=94metrics, scope, stakeholders=
=E2=80=94before you ask the model to draft anything. The loop amplifies cla=
rity; it will not conjure clarity from thin air. If you can=E2=80=99t write=
 a single guiding sentence (=E2=80=9CWe need a PRD that locks scope to v1 m=
obile only, measures MAU uplift, and calls out design debt explicitly=E2=80=
=9D), pause and decide that first. Otherwise the critique step will mirror =
your own vagueness right back at you.
3. Lock the output shape to your real workflow.
End every prompt with an explicit schema or template that matches how the a=
rtifact will be consumed=E2=80=94a one-page PRD, a six-column risk table, a=
 markdown journey map. The refine pass can only steer toward a destination =
you define; if the structure drifts, stakeholders will reject the doc no ma=
tter how polished the prose. When the model=E2=80=99s final output drops cl=
eanly into the next tool=E2=80=94Jira ticket, RFC repo, slide deck=E2=80=94=
you know the loop has done its job.
Hold these three rails and the rest takes care of itself. The model becomes=
 an accelerant for well-prepared thinking, not a replacement for it=E2=80=
=94and that, ultimately, is the leverage you=E2=80=99re after.
Wrap-Up & Challenge
The playbook is simple: pick a =E2=80=9Ctoken-ready=E2=80=9D task, feed in =
curated facts, and let a reasoning-strong model Think =E2=86=92 Critique =
=E2=86=92 Refine inside the schema you=E2=80=99ll actually use. o3, o4-mini=
-high, or Gemini 2.5 Pro will tear through a PRD, RCA, trade-off matrix, OK=
R sheet, or journey map in the time it used to take you to spin up a meetin=
g invite=E2=80=94provided you respect the three guardrails: clean inputs, c=
lear problem frame, locked output shape.
Your next step is equally simple:
Grab the PRD prompt above (or whichever artifact hurts most this week).
Slot in real notes and constraints=E2=80=94nothing extra, nothing missing.
Hit run, watch the model argue with itself, and skim the refined draft.
Count the minutes you just reclaimed.
Post your before-and-after time delta=E2=80=94or the sharpest critique the =
model surfaced=E2=80=94in the comments. Personally, I always like the criti=
ques the model gives=E2=80=94if I asked it for hard thinking and refinement=
 it will throw up all sorts of interesting stuff if my inputs are clean.
Three prompts, one loop, and your calendar just got lighter.
