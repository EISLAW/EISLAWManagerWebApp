THE US SHIFTS COURSE IN THE RED SEA STANDOFF [3]
THE CEASEFIRE WITH THE HOUTHIS REFLECTS A PIVOT TOWARD REGIONAL BALANCING AND DIPLOMATIC CONTAINMENT.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the end of U.S. airstrikes against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement. The decision followed a ceasefire agreement brokered by Oman. It
required both sides to stop targeting each other, particularly in the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The Houthis, however, made clear that their hostilities toward Israel would continue,
underscoring the ceasefire’s limited scope.
The U.S.-Houthi ceasefire marks a turning point in Washington’s Middle East policy. After more than 16 months of reactive operations and inconclusive bombing campaigns, the limits of airpower in
addressing asymmetric threats in vital maritime corridors were clear. The agreement thus reflects a move by the U.S. away from open-ended military engagements toward diplomacy mediated by regional
actors.
Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping had thrown global trade into disarray. Between November and December 2023, after more than a month of attacks, global trade fell 1.2 percent. Suez Canal traffic
declined by half in early 2024. Prior to the disruption, the canal handled about 12 percent of global trade and 30 percent of global container traffic. Companies rerouted ships around the Cape of Good
Hope, leading to a 180 percent surge in shipping costs. East African and Gulf ports became congested, causing delays of up to two weeks. These disruptions affected supply chains for energy, food and
critical minerals, raised consumer prices, and exposed vulnerabilities in just-in-time manufacturing.
[Houthi-Controlled Territory in Relation to the Red Sea] [4]

The Houthis understood the leverage they had. The group emerged from a Zaydi Shiite revivalist movement in northern Yemen in the early 1990s. It rose to power after seizing Sanaa in 2014, triggering a
Saudi-led intervention backed by the United States. Ideologically aligned with Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” the Houthis have consistently targeted U.S. and Israeli interests. Their hostility
intensified after the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023, leading to a wave of attacks on Red Sea shipping and regional targets in solidarity with Palestinians.
The U.S. response was initially limited, focused on deterring attacks and protecting commercial vessels. But as the attacks intensified, so did U.S. counterstrikes. In March 2025, Washington launched
Operation Rough Rider, conducting more than 1,000 airstrikes on Houthi missile sites and command centers. The operation, framed as a campaign to restore freedom of navigation, included the deployment
of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, an extended mission for the USS Harry S. Truman and the relocation of B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia.
Despite this show of force, the Houthis remained operational. Mobile launchers and rugged terrain blunted the effect of U.S. airpower. Meanwhile, the cost asymmetry and operational strain of a
prolonged engagement wore down Washington’s resolve. U.S. forces employed expensive interceptors (such as the $2 million SM-2 and $10 million SM-3) against cheap drones. Multiple U.S. MQ-9 Reaper
drones were downed during the campaign. One F/A-18 was lost to friendly fire, and another slid off a carrier during evasive maneuvers. The operation had started to resemble a quagmire with diminished
strategic returns.
Faced with a choice between escalating further or cutting a deal, the U.S. chose the latter. The ceasefire enabled the U.S. to disengage without admitting failure. It stopped a costly, open-ended
campaign while preserving the ability to strike again if needed. Though not defeated militarily, the Houthis also had reason to seek a pause. Sustained U.S. strikes threatened to degrade their
long-term capabilities, while continued escalation risked undermining their political standing and alienating Iran and Oman. The agreement enabled the group to avoid confrontation with a superior
adversary while preserving its strength for other regional engagements.
Crucially, the deal excluded Israel. Only days earlier, the Houthis had struck Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport with a ballistic missile, having previously demonstrated the capability for
missile strikes against central Israel last September. The May 4 attack prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to issue stern warnings and reassess the country’s air defense posture.
Alarmed at the risk that Israeli retaliation could spark a wider war involving Iran or Hezbollah, U.S. officials responded by narrowing the scope of military operations and accepting a ceasefire that
excluded Israeli interests. This was a deliberate effort to compartmentalize the maritime crisis from the broader Israel-Iran conflict. (If the message was not clear, U.S. President Donald Trump also
skipped Israel during his recent tour of the Middle East.)
Strategically, the ceasefire reflects a U.S. effort to reduce its reliance on military force and avoid regional entanglements. Washington wants instead to pivot toward regional balancing and
diplomatic containment, including engagement with non-state actors through regional intermediaries. The agreement could open channels for renewed U.S.-Iran dialogue and encourage Gulf states to
continue easing tensions with Iran. At the same time, restoring safe passage through the Red Sea is essential for regaining investor and shipping confidence and stabilizing global trade. This is
especially critical for Europe, which, unlike the U.S., relies heavily on uninterrupted shipping through the Suez Canal. In response to the Houthi attacks, the European Union launched its own naval
escort mission, Operation Aspides, to protect Red Sea shipping – signaling a shift in burden-sharing as the U.S. reassesses its international commitments.
The 2025 ceasefire represents a key moment in U.S. strategy. It emphasizes diplomatic de-escalation and regional mediation in dealing with asymmetric threats, especially when military solutions
produce diminishing returns. While not a doctrinal overhaul, the ceasefire signals a case-specific recalibration following a costly and inconclusive campaign. Operation Rough Rider revealed the limits
of traditional naval power in complex maritime conflicts. Challenges persist – particularly the unresolved conflict between the Houthis and Israel – but the ceasefire offers a practical model for
future engagements.
Its endurance depends not on trust but on overlapping interests: the Houthis seek to avoid further military degradation and political isolation, while the U.S. aims to reduce overextension and
prioritize great power competition. Oman’s neutrality and global pressure to stabilize Red Sea trade routes support the agreement’s short-term viability. Though fragile, the ceasefire reflects a
pragmatic U.S. posture that combines military restraint with focused diplomacy, aiming to manage regional crises without losing sight of broader strategic imperatives.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the end of U.S. airstrikes against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement. The decision followed a ceasefire agreement brokered by Oman. It required both sides to stop targeting each other, particularly in the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The Houthis, however, made clear that their hostilities toward Israel would continue, underscoring the ceasefire’s limited scope.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S.-Houthi ceasefire marks a turning point in Washington’s Middle East policy. After more than 16 months of reactive operations and inconclusive bombing campaigns, the limits of airpower in addressing asymmetric threats in vital maritime corridors were clear. The agreement thus reflects a move by the U.S. away from open-ended military engagements toward diplomacy mediated by regional actors.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping had thrown global trade into disarray. Between November and December 2023, after more than a month of attacks, global trade fell 1.2 percent. Suez Canal traffic declined by half in early 2024. Prior to the disruption, the canal handled about 12 percent of global trade and 30 percent of global container traffic. Companies rerouted ships around the Cape of Good Hope, leading to a 180 percent surge in shipping costs. East African and Gulf ports became congested, causing delays of up to two weeks. These disruptions affected supply chains for energy, food and critical minerals, raised consumer prices, and exposed vulnerabilities in just-in-time manufacturing.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Houthis understood the leverage they had. The group emerged from a Zaydi Shiite revivalist movement in northern Yemen in the early 1990s. It rose to power after seizing Sanaa in 2014, triggering a Saudi-led intervention backed by the United States. Ideologically aligned with Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” the Houthis have consistently targeted U.S. and Israeli interests. Their hostility intensified after the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023, leading to a wave of attacks on Red Sea shipping and regional targets in solidarity with Palestinians.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. response was initially limited, focused on deterring attacks and protecting commercial vessels. But as the attacks intensified, so did U.S. counterstrikes. In March 2025, Washington launched Operation Rough Rider, conducting more than 1,000 airstrikes on Houthi missile sites and command centers. The operation, framed as a campaign to restore freedom of navigation, included the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, an extended mission for the USS Harry S. Truman and the relocation of B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite this show of force, the Houthis remained operational. Mobile launchers and rugged terrain blunted the effect of U.S. airpower. Meanwhile, the cost asymmetry and operational strain of a prolonged engagement wore down Washington’s resolve. U.S. forces employed expensive interceptors (such as the $2 million SM-2 and $10 million SM-3) against cheap drones. Multiple U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were downed during the campaign. One F/A-18 was lost to friendly fire, and another slid off a carrier during evasive maneuvers. The operation had started to resemble a quagmire with diminished strategic returns.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Faced with a choice between escalating further or cutting a deal, the U.S. chose the latter. The ceasefire enabled the U.S. to disengage without admitting failure. It stopped a costly, open-ended campaign while preserving the ability to strike again if needed. Though not defeated militarily, the Houthis also had reason to seek a pause. Sustained U.S. strikes threatened to degrade their long-term capabilities, while continued escalation risked undermining their political standing and alienating Iran and Oman. The agreement enabled the group to avoid confrontation with a superior adversary while preserving its strength for other regional engagements.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Crucially, the deal excluded Israel. Only days earlier, the Houthis had struck Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport with a ballistic missile, having previously demonstrated the capability for missile strikes against central Israel last September. The May 4 attack prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to issue stern warnings and reassess the country’s air defense posture. Alarmed at the risk that Israeli retaliation could spark a wider war involving Iran or Hezbollah, U.S. officials responded by narrowing the scope of military operations and accepting a ceasefire that excluded Israeli interests. This was a deliberate effort to compartmentalize the maritime crisis from the broader Israel-Iran conflict. (If the message was not clear, U.S. President Donald Trump also skipped Israel during his recent tour of the Middle East.)</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Strategically, the ceasefire reflects a U.S. effort to reduce its reliance on military force and avoid regional entanglements. Washington wants instead to pivot toward regional balancing and diplomatic containment, including engagement with non-state actors through regional intermediaries. The agreement could open channels for renewed U.S.-Iran dialogue and encourage Gulf states to continue easing tensions with Iran. At the same time, restoring safe passage through the Red Sea is essential for regaining investor and shipping confidence and stabilizing global trade. This is especially critical for Europe, which, unlike the U.S., relies heavily on uninterrupted shipping through the Suez Canal. In response to the Houthi attacks, the European Union launched its own naval escort mission, Operation Aspides, to protect Red Sea shipping – signaling a shift in burden-sharing as the U.S. reassesses its international commitments.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The 2025 ceasefire represents a key moment in U.S. strategy. It emphasizes diplomatic de-escalation and regional mediation in dealing with asymmetric threats, especially when military solutions produce diminishing returns. While not a doctrinal overhaul, the ceasefire signals a case-specific recalibration following a costly and inconclusive campaign. Operation Rough Rider revealed the limits of traditional naval power in complex maritime conflicts. Challenges persist – particularly the unresolved conflict between the Houthis and Israel – but the ceasefire offers a practical model for future engagements.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Its endurance depends not on trust but on overlapping interests: the Houthis seek to avoid further military degradation and political isolation, while the U.S. aims to reduce overextension and prioritize great power competition. Oman’s neutrality and global pressure to stabilize Red Sea trade routes support the agreement’s short-term viability. Though fragile, the ceasefire reflects a pragmatic U.S. posture that combines military restraint with focused diplomacy, aiming to manage regional crises without losing sight of broader strategic imperatives.</p>
