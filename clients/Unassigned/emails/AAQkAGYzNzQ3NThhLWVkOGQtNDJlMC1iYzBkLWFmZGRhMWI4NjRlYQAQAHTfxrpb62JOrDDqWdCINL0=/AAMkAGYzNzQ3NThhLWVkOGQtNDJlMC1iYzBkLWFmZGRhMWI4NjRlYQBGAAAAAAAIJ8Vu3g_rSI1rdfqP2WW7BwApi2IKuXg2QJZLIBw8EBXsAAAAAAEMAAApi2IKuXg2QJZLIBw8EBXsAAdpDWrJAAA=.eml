WHERE INDIA FITS INTO NEW US STRATEGIES [3]
CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATED ALIGNMENT FOR DECADES. BUT CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
In its 2025 annual forecast [4], GPF wrote that the world no longer has an anchor around which to organize itself. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the downturn in U.S.-India relations. New
Delhi assumed that its relationship with Washington was immune to the shifts in America’s global strategy, but that has not been the case. The Trump administration’s efforts to manage its two
biggest adversaries, China and Russia, have revealed the limits of its decadeslong alignment with India. India still boasts the world’s fastest-growing economy, so it will remain a key U.S. partner,
but it is unlikely to retain its special status as the U.S.-China competition heats up.
[U.S.-India Relations] [5]
_(click to enlarge)_ [6]
On Aug. 6, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods in response to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. The move brought overall tariffs on the
world’s most populous nation (and close American ally) to 50 percent – among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Also on Aug. 6, Indian media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi
will travel to China on Aug. 31 – his first trip to the country since the border clashes of June 2020 – to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Elsewhere, Indian national security
adviser Ajit Doval is leaving for a trip to Moscow ahead of another visit to the Kremlin by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
These developments constitute a dramatic turn of events. Until recently, the United States saw India as a strategic ally, especially with regard to its foreign policy objective to contain China. This
has been the case for every U.S. administration, including Trump’s first one, since the early 2000s. Central to that view is that over the past two decades, India’s has become the world's
fourth-largest economy, in terms of nominal gross domestic product, overtaking Russia’s, Italy’s, France’s, the United Kingdom’s and Japan’s. It also has the world’s fourth-largest
military.
For these reasons, Washington has cultivated New Delhi as a critical partner on the military and economic fronts. In 2017, it revived the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and combined the Indian Ocean
and Pacific Ocean basins into a single command known as INDOPACOM, making it easier to integrate India into its strategic plans for countering China. It also hoped India would be able to become an
alternative industrial destination to help reduce global exposure to Chinese manufacturing.
But after promising starts, Washington has come to realize that these are long-term efforts. And in a post-COVID, post-Ukraine war era, Russia is dramatically diminished, and Chinese economic growth
has plateaued. The Trump administration wants to take advantage of these new realities to reduce U.S. exposure to global risks and has tried to forge a new strategy accordingly [7]. Trump’s
retrenchment efforts are essentially two-pronged: have allies and partner nations take the lead in security for their respective regions, and use tariffs to correct trade imbalances, defend U.S.
industries and reshape global commercial norms in the United States' favor.
As the U.S. pursues this strategy, Russia and China are the priority. Washington must bring an end to the war in Ukraine, so it’s trying to force Russia to accept a negotiated settlement of the
conflict. At the same time, the Trump administration must bargain with China to ensure that its geoeconomic influence is kept in check, especially on the technological front.
Here is where the U.S. view of India has shifted. Trump needs the Modi government to stop purchasing oil from the Kremlin because this would help Washington squeeze Moscow at the bargaining table.
India’s refusal to do so has led to a serious breach in bilateral relations. (The failure to reach a trade deal didn’t help, nor did the concurrent disagreements over Washington’s role in
ceasefire talks between India and Pakistan.) But this isn’t just a tactical move born of Washington’s need to force Russia’s hand; it is a strategic shift in U.S thinking about India’s utility
in managing China.
Washington understands that there are limits to how far it can derisk itself from Beijing, especially in specific areas like rare earths. It thus needs to reach a strategic accommodation with China.
Talks toward that end include demands that China cannot expect to do business with the U.S. – something Beijing badly needs – while continuing to be a military threat. Beijing’s interest is
largely economic, but if it shows some flexibility on, say, Taiwan, then in return it would expect the U.S. to deprioritize its strategic partnerships with India.
Regardless of the specific give and take they settle on, the reality is that the U.S. doesn’t need India as much as it once did. India understands as much and is trying to improve its standing with
China. But it came to that realization too late, and Indian leaders believed for too long in the old paradigm, by which New Delhi could continue to do business with Russia and remain indispensable on
China. U.S. ties to India are still important, but as Washington reconsiders its strategic options, so too will it reconsider the perishability of its partnerships.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In its 2025 <a href="https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/409229/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW9wb2xpdGljYWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LWZvcmVjYXN0LWEtd29ybGQtd2l0aG91dC1hbi1hbmNob3Iv" style="color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">annual forecast</a>, GPF wrote that the world no longer has an anchor around which to organize itself. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the downturn in U.S.-India relations. New Delhi assumed that its relationship with Washington was immune to the shifts in America’s global strategy, but that has not been the case. The Trump administration’s efforts to manage its two biggest adversaries, China and Russia, have revealed the limits of its decadeslong alignment with India. India still boasts the world’s fastest-growing economy, so it will remain a key U.S. partner, but it is unlikely to retain its special status as the U.S.-China competition heats up.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On Aug. 6, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods in response to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. The move brought overall tariffs on the world’s most populous nation (and close American ally) to 50 percent – among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Also on Aug. 6, Indian media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to China on Aug. 31 – his first trip to the country since the border clashes of June 2020 – to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Elsewhere, Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval is leaving for a trip to Moscow ahead of another visit to the Kremlin by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These developments constitute a dramatic turn of events. Until recently, the United States saw India as a strategic ally, especially with regard to its foreign policy objective to contain China. This has been the case for every U.S. administration, including Trump’s first one, since the early 2000s. Central to that view is that over the past two decades, India’s has become the world's fourth-largest economy, in terms of nominal gross domestic product, overtaking Russia’s, Italy’s, France’s, the United Kingdom’s and Japan’s. It also has the world’s fourth-largest military.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For these reasons, Washington has cultivated New Delhi as a critical partner on the military and economic fronts. In 2017, it revived the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and combined the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean basins into a single command known as INDOPACOM, making it easier to integrate India into its strategic plans for countering China. It also hoped India would be able to become an alternative industrial destination to help reduce global exposure to Chinese manufacturing.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But after promising starts, Washington has come to realize that these are long-term efforts. And in a post-COVID, post-Ukraine war era, Russia is dramatically diminished, and Chinese economic growth has plateaued. The Trump administration wants to take advantage of these new realities to reduce U.S. exposure to global risks and has <a href="https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/409229/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW9wb2xpdGljYWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS90aGUtdXMtZ2Vvc3RyYXRlZ3ktYW5kLXRoZS1vbGQtd29ybGQtb3JkZXIv" style="color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">tried to forge a new strategy accordingly</a>. Trump’s retrenchment efforts are essentially two-pronged: have allies and partner nations take the lead in security for their respective regions, and use tariffs to correct trade imbalances, defend U.S. industries and reshape global commercial norms in the United States' favor.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As the U.S. pursues this strategy, Russia and China are the priority. Washington must bring an end to the war in Ukraine, so it’s trying to force Russia to accept a negotiated settlement of the conflict. At the same time, the Trump administration must bargain with China to ensure that its geoeconomic influence is kept in check, especially on the technological front.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Here is where the U.S. view of India has shifted. Trump needs the Modi government to stop purchasing oil from the Kremlin because this would help Washington squeeze Moscow at the bargaining table. India’s refusal to do so has led to a serious breach in bilateral relations. (The failure to reach a trade deal didn’t help, nor did the concurrent disagreements over Washington’s role in ceasefire talks between India and Pakistan.) But this isn’t just a tactical move born of Washington’s need to force Russia’s hand; it is a strategic shift in U.S thinking about India’s utility in managing China.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington understands that there are limits to how far it can derisk itself from Beijing, especially in specific areas like rare earths. It thus needs to reach a strategic accommodation with China. Talks toward that end include demands that China cannot expect to do business with the U.S. – something Beijing badly needs – while continuing to be a military threat. Beijing’s interest is largely economic, but if it shows some flexibility on, say, Taiwan, then in return it would expect the U.S. to deprioritize its strategic partnerships with India.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Regardless of the specific give and take they settle on, the reality is that the U.S. doesn’t need India as much as it once did. India understands as much and is trying to improve its standing with China. But it came to that realization too late, and Indian leaders believed for too long in the old paradigm, by which New Delhi could continue to do business with Russia and remain indispensable on China. U.S. ties to India are still important, but as Washington reconsiders its strategic options, so too will it reconsider the perishability of its partnerships.</p>
