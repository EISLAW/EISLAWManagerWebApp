o-is-here-its-good-and-its

AI video has easily 10x=E2=80=99d in a year. So if the last you checked in =
is Sora, it=E2=80=99s time to pay attention.=20
YouTube is a great resource for where the space is, and I=E2=80=99ll link a=
 few throughout this piece.=20
As an example, check out the demo for a tool named (really) nano banana:
A year ago we were still talking about character consistency, and about mic=
ro emotions in the face. All of those are getting solved, at least for shor=
t clips.
And why does all this matter? Video is the native format of the web these d=
ays, and AI video democratizes the power of video so everybody can make any=
thing they want=E2=80=94whether that=E2=80=99s ads or stories or sizzle ree=
ls or really anything you can imagine.=20
The only thing you need to make phenomenal video these days is (sigh) promp=
ting and clear intent, plus patience. Yes, clean prompting and workflows st=
ill matters. Seems to be a common thread across AI tooling.=20
Read on to figure out how to go from the sidelines to making your own AI vi=
deos! And yes, I=E2=80=99ll include a prompt or two to get you started!
Sidebar: I=E2=80=99m going to be away from keys a bit more over the next we=
ek or so, so expect somewhat slower responses in the comments, and maybe a =
day or two off here and there.=20
I=E2=80=99m taking some time to stare at the ocean and recharge so I can ge=
t back to some great AI work with all of you in the fall! Don=E2=80=99t wor=
ry, there=E2=80=99s still LOTS of great content like this coming through Au=
gust=E2=80=94I made sure of that.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
The AI Video Tools That Actually Matter Right Now
So here=E2=80=99s your guide to what=E2=80=99s genuinely different in AI vi=
deo tools now=E2=80=94practical, usable, ship-it-to-clients different. Let =
me walk you through what's actually working and what's worth your time.
What Makes 2025's Tools Different
The current generation of AI video tools has crossed three critical thresho=
lds that separate them from last year's novelties.
First, physics finally works. Water flows naturally, fire spreads convincin=
gly, fabric drapes properly. Your brain evolved to spot these violations in=
stantly=E2=80=94when AI gets them right, everything else becomes believable=
=2E Watch a Runway Gen-4 output of some=
one walking through rain. The splash p=
atterns, the way water beads on skin, the weight of wet clothing=E2=80=94it=
 all just works now.
Second, we have emotional granularity. Tools like Seedream and Hailuo AI un=
derstand micro-expressions. Not just "happy" or "sad," but the subtle tensi=
on around someone's eyes before they cry, the asymmetric pull of genuine am=
usement, the slight shoulder drop when someone truly relaxes. This isn't an=
imation anymore=E2=80=94it's performance.
Third, consistency is achievable. Not perfect, but achievable. You can main=
tain character appearance, lighting, and physics rules across multiple shot=
s. Six months ago, every new generation created a different person. Today, =
I can create a five-scene sequence that feels coherent.
The Tools That Matter
Let me be specific about what's working and what each tool actually does we=
ll.
Runway Gen-4 remains the workhorse for artistic and cinematic work. It exce=
ls at stylized visuals=E2=80=94think Terrence Malick dreamscapes or noir ci=
nematography. The motion realism is solid, and the style transfer capabilit=
ies let you maintain consistent aesthetic across projects. When I need some=
thing that looks deliberately crafted rather than realistic, Runway deliver=
s.
Kling has become essential for realistic human movement. The lip-sync is es=
sentially perfect, the avatar generation maintains personality across clips=
, and the dynamic lighting responds naturally to movement. If you need a ch=
aracter walking, talking, or interacting naturally, Kling handles it really=
 well.
OpenAI's Sora is still limited access and is frankly due for an update, but=
 if you can get in, the creative control is really interesting. Complex sce=
ne composition, multi-element interactions, coherent physics across elabora=
te setups=E2=80=94Sora lets you describe intricate scenarios and actually g=
et them. "Tracking shot through a rain-soaked Tokyo alley, neon reflections=
 on puddles, lone figure in silhouette" gives you exactly that. I wouldn=E2=
=80=99t recommend it wholeheartedly because (as noted) it=E2=80=99s in beta=
 and also because I think it=E2=80=99s just slightly stale on character con=
sistency and other stuf that matters in 2025.
HeyGen and Synthesia have made talking head content genuinely useful. I kno=
w "AI avatar" triggers skepticism, but the latest versions work. HeyGen's e=
motional range modeling means you can direct performances=E2=80=94concerned=
, enthusiastic, skeptical. The multilingual capabilities are game-changing =
for international content. One recording, twelve languages, perfect lip-syn=
c in each.
Seedream specializes in emotional subtlety. The micro-emotions, the skin de=
tail, the way light plays across faces=E2=80=94it's creating genuinely expr=
essive content. That image attached to this post? That's Seedream. Look at =
the authenticity in those eyes. This level of emotional complexity was impo=
ssible six months ago.
Hailuo AI brings real-time editing capabilities. Gesture realism, animation=
 blending, the ability to adjust expressions on the fly=E2=80=94it's partic=
ularly strong for iterative creative work where you need to refine performa=
nces quickly.
Nano-Banana is the mystery tool that appeared in August and might be the mo=
st important development of 2025. Nobody knows who built it=E2=80=94specula=
tion says Google, given their fruit-naming tradition=E2=80=94but it showed =
up anonymously in LM Arena's Image Edit Arena and immediately started domin=
ating. Here's what makes it different: you can tell it "remove the car and =
add a sunset" and it maintains perfect lighting consistency. Character feat=
ures stay stable across different poses and angles. Multi-step complex edit=
s that would take hours in Photoshop happen in seconds. The catch? You can =
only access it randomly through LM Arena right now, and when you do get it,=
 you better use it because you don't know when you'll see it again.
The Cutting-Edge Versus the Accessible
There's a gap between what's theoretically available and what you can actua=
lly use today. Google Veo and some of the more advanced Sora features are p=
henomenal but locked behind private betas.
Nano-Banana deserves special mention here because it represents something n=
ew: anonymous, possibly rogue AI development. It just appeared one day in A=
ugust, started beating everything else in blind tests, and nobody knows who=
 made it. The speculation that it's Google makes sense=E2=80=94they use fru=
it codenames, and the quality suggests serious resources=E2=80=94but the an=
onymous release is unprecedented. When you do catch it on LM Arena, the exp=
erience is surreal. You watch it handle complex multi-step edits that would=
 crash other models, maintain perfect lighting consistency across dramatic =
changes, and preserve character features through impossible transformations=
=2E Then it disappears and you're back=20=
to using normal tools, wondering if yo=
u imagined it.
Here's my practical advice: start with what's accessible. Runway, Kling, an=
d HeyGen all offer reasonable entry points with trial credits or affordable=
 tiers. You can learn the principles, develop your eye for what works, and =
build actual projects while waiting for broader access to the cutting-edge =
tools.
The mainstream platforms are also where features from advanced tools eventu=
ally land. Runway regularly incorporates techniques that were exclusive to =
research models six months prior. By the time you get access to Veo or adva=
nced Sora features, you'll understand how to use them effectively.
Steps to get going
Here's exactly what to do today if you want to start creating AI video cont=
ent.
Step 1: Create your accounts (30 minutes) Go to kling.ai and create an acco=
unt. They give you 66 free credits daily=E2=80=94enough for about 6 video g=
enerations. While that's processing, head to runwayml.com and sign up for t=
heir free tier (125 credits). If you catch Nano-Banana on LM Arena (lmarena=
=2Eai), bookmark it immediately=E2=80=94you=
 might not see it again for days.
Step 2: Your first real prompt (not "woman walking") Open Kling. Don't type=
 "sunset" or "person walking." Try this exact prompt: "Medium shot, young p=
rofessional in navy suit, coffee shop background with bokeh, slight smile b=
uilding to genuine laugh, warm afternoon light from window screen left, han=
dheld camera slight movement, 5 seconds." Generate it three times with the =
same prompt. Notice how each varies. This teaches you about seed variation.
Step 3: Reference image workflow Find a photo with lighting you like=E2=80=
=94could be from Unsplash, could be your phone. Upload it to Runway as a re=
ference. Now prompt: "Match lighting and color grade of reference, but scen=
e is [completely different subject]." This separation of style from content=
 is crucial. You're learning to control aesthetics independently from actio=
n.
Step 4: The comparison test Take the exact same prompt and run it through t=
hree different tools on the same day. "Close-up of hands typing on vintage =
typewriter, dusty light beam from window, particles visible in air, shallow=
 DOF, slight push in." Try it in Runway, Kling, and if you can access it, S=
ora or Nano-Banana. Document which tool handles which elements best. Runway=
 will nail the atmosphere, Kling will get the hand movements right, Sora wi=
ll manage the complex particle physics.
Step 5: Build your prompt library Create a document. Not a fancy database=
=E2=80=94just a Google Doc. Every time something works, paste the exact pro=
mpt. Every time something fails spectacularly, paste that too with a note a=
bout why. After 50 generations, patterns emerge. You'll notice that "cinema=
tic" means different things to different models, that Kling loves specific =
camera movements ("dolly zoom," "handheld shake"), that Runway responds bet=
ter to art history references than technical film terms.
Step 7: Join the right communities Skip the main AI subreddits=E2=80=94they=
're mostly hype. Go to r/AiVideoEditing and r/RunwayML. The Discord servers=
 that matter: Runway's official (discord.gg/runwayml), Kling Global Communi=
ty, and if you're serious, pay for Ben's Bites Pro=E2=80=94their Discord ha=
s actual professionals sharing workflows. Follow @karenxcheng, @bakztfuture=
, and @ai_for_video on Twitter. They post daily experiments with actual pro=
mpts included.
Step 8: Your first real project Don't make a demo reel. Make something with=
 a purpose. A 15-second product video for a friend's business. A birthday m=
essage with impossible physics. A visualization of a concept you can't film=
=2E Having constraints and an actual au=
dience changes everything. You'll stop=
 generating random pretty clips and start solving specific problems.
5 Video Prompts (drop-in, model-agnostic)
1) POV documentary =E2=80=94 object interaction + atmospheric lighting
First-person POV in a dim, dust-filled workshop at golden hour; hands unlat=

 ring; volumetric light shafts cut through floating dust; natural auto-expo=
sure breathing, micro-handheld jitter, subtle lens breathing; shallow DOF i=
solates fingertips and knurled metal; real-world foley (hinge creak, cloth =
rub, distant traffic hum); single unbroken take, 7=E2=80=939s, 24fps, 4K, 1=

2) Wide establishing =E2=80=94 environmental story + subtle movement
Locked master wide of a coastal town street at blue hour; slow 5% push-in a=
dds parallax; clues of backstory: boarded storefront with taped notice, =E2=
=80=9Cmissing=E2=80=9D flyer on a lamppost, flickering diner neon, gulls tr=
acing lazy circles, steam drifting from a roof vent, wind nudging a loose s=
ign chain; 24mm, f/5.6, tripod; gentle ambient wind and distant waves; hold=
 tension with near-stillness; 8=E2=80=9310s, 24fps, 4K, 2.39:1; restrained =
contrast, cool palette with warm neon accents.
3) Macro product =E2=80=94 liquid dynamics + commercial polish
Extreme macro of a matte-black serum bottle centered on glossy black acryli=
c; backlit gradient and crisp edge lights; a viscous droplet forms, release=
s, crowns on the cap, micro-splashes bead and roll; secondary shot: laminar=
 pour sheets down glass creating clean specular trails; controlled ripples,=
 no mess beyond hero; 240fps capture played back at 24fps (10=C3=97 slow), =
6=E2=80=938s final; pristine, dust-free, high contrast; 4K, 16:9; studio fo=
ley (soft pour, subtle fizz); no logos/text.
4) Intimate portrait =E2=80=94 reflections, weather, emotional subtlety
Tight 85mm portrait on a city bus at night; rain-streaked window as reflect=
ive layer with neon signage drifting across the face; subject gazes outward=
, eyes glint, breath fogs the glass; fingertip idly traces a small circle, =
half-erasing condensation; micro-expression shifts from guarded to faintly =
hopeful; soft rim from passing streetlights, shallow DOF, gentle handheld s=
way; 6=E2=80=938s, 24fps, 4K, 16:9; moody, slightly desaturated grade with =
teal/orange highlights; production sound only, no dialogue.
5) Tracking action =E2=80=94 movement transitions + genre mood
Gimbal follow of a parkour runner weaving through night-market alleys into =
a staircase sprint; speed-ramp to a whip-pan that match-cuts through a door=
way onto a rooftop sprint; neo-noir vibe with practical sodium/LED spill, w=
et pavement gleam, occasional lens flare; maintain forward momentum, preser=
ve motion blur; 35mm, 60=E2=86=9224fps ramps, 8=E2=80=9310s, 4K, 2.39:1; ti=
ght whoosh/footfall foley; end on a breathing beat against a skyline=E2=80=
=94musicless tension, no titles.
Pro workflows
Here's what actually happens when you're creating professional AI video con=
tent.
You start with clear intention and detailed planning. Storyboard your seque=
nces, define your visual style, specify emotional beats. The tools are powe=
rful but they're not mind readers. The clearer your vision, the better your=
 results.
You generate extensively and select ruthlessly. For every shot in your fina=
l video, you might generate fifteen to twenty variations. This isn't becaus=
e the tools are unreliable=E2=80=94it's because they give you options you h=
adn't considered. Sometimes variation seven has a camera angle that transfo=
rms the entire emotional tone.
You use hybrid workflows. AI generation plus traditional editing equals pro=
fessional output. Generate your raw material with AI, then use Premiere, Da=
Vinci Resolve, or even simpler tools like CapCut for timing, transitions, a=
nd final polish. The AI provides infinite raw material; traditional editing=
 provides precision control.
You train custom models when it matters. Both Kling and HeyGen let you trai=
n on your own appearance or specific visual styles. This isn't vanity=E2=80=
=94it's about consistency. If you need the same character across multiple v=
ideos, or your brand requires specific visual language, custom training is =
essential.
What=E2=80=99s still hard
Let's be honest about what's still hard.
Temporal consistency remains challenging across longer sequences. Generatin=
g one amazing shot is straightforward. Generating ten shots that feel like =
they're from the same film, with consistent lighting, physics, and characte=
r appearance=E2=80=94that requires significant post-production work.
The uncanny valley moved rather than disappeared. Instead of obviously fake=
 faces, we now have subtly wrong physics. A character's weight doesn't quit=
e match their movement. Fabric behaves almost correctly. These micro-incons=
istencies create subconscious unease that you have to either minimize or de=
liberately leverage for effect.
Compute costs scale faster than you expect. Professional projects can easil=
y run hundreds of dollars in generation costs when you factor in all the it=
erations and experiments. Budget accordingly.
Complex interactions between multiple elements remain difficult. A single p=
erson walking works great. Two people having a conversation with consistent=
 eye contact and natural body language? Much harder. Crowds, complex choreo=
graphy, precise object manipulation=E2=80=94these all require workarounds a=
nd multiple attempts.
Access to the best tools remains frustratingly random. Nano-Banana appears =
and disappears from LM Arena without warning. Sora access is still lottery-=
based. Google Veo might be incredible but good luck getting in. You'll wast=
e hours refreshing platforms hoping to catch the good models when they're a=
vailable.
What can we expect next?
Based on what I'm seeing in betas and research papers, here's what's coming=
 in the next six to twelve months.
Real-time generation is almost here. We're moving from minutes to seconds f=
or basic generation. Soon it'll be instantaneous for simple scenes. This ch=
anges everything about iteration and creative exploration.
Consistency models are the next frontier. Companies are developing systems =
that maintain visual DNA across entire productions. Same physics, same ligh=
ting logic, same character details=E2=80=94automatically maintained across =
hundreds of shots.
Control precision is improving dramatically. Instead of hoping the AI inter=
prets your prompt correctly, you'll have granular control over camera movem=
ent, timing, emotional progression. Think of it as moving from spray-and-pr=
ay to actual cinematography.
Integration with traditional pipelines is becoming seamless. AI video tools=
 are being built into established workflows rather than replacing them. Plu=
gins for major editing software, direct integration with asset management s=
ystems, compatibility with professional color grading tools.
Getting started - yes you
If you work in any creative field, you need to develop an opinion about AI =
video tools now. Not because traditional methods are dying=E2=80=94they're =
not=E2=80=94but because the competitive landscape is shifting whether you p=
articipate or not.
If you read this newsletter you know I=E2=80=99m a fan of the practical. St=
art with one tool. Spend real time with it. Generate those hundred clips. P=
ay attention to what surprises you=E2=80=94when the AI creates something un=
expected but better than your intention, study why. Those moments of genera=
tive serendipity are where new visual languages emerge.
Share your work and learn from others. The AI video community is remarkably=
 collaborative right now because we're all figuring this out together. Your=
 failed experiment might solve someone else's problem.
Most importantly, understand that these are tools, not replacements. The be=
st AI video content I'm seeing comes from people who understand visual stor=
ytelling, who have developed taste, who know why certain images resonate. T=
he barrier to entry has lowered, but the ceiling for excellence remains hig=
h.
The tools are here. They work. The question isn't whether to use them, but =
how to use them thoughtfully. The difference between AI tourism and actual =
creation is intention, iteration, and the discipline to know when generated=
 is good enough and when it needs to be genuinely good.

 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The curr=
ent generation of AI video tools has crossed three critical thresholds that=
 separate them from last year's novelties.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First, physics f=
inally works. Water flows naturally, fire spreads convincingly, fabric drap=
es properly. Your brain evolved to spot these violations instantly=E2=80=94=
when AI gets them right, everything else becomes believable. Watch a Runway=
 Gen-4 output of someone walking through rain. The splash patterns, the way=
 water beads on skin, the weight of wet clothing=E2=80=94it all just works =
now.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">Second, we have emotional granularity. Tools like Seed=
ream and Hailuo AI understand micro-expressions. Not just &quot;happy&quot;=
 or &quot;sad,&quot; but the subtle tension around someone's eyes before th=
ey cry, the asymmetric pull of genuine amusement, the slight shoulder drop =
when someone truly relaxes. This isn't animation anymore=E2=80=94it's perfo=
rmance.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">Third, consistency is achievable. Not perfect, but =
achievable. You can maintain character appearance, lighting, and physics ru=

ome of the more advanced Sora features are phenomenal but locked behind pri=
vate betas.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=

se it represents something new: anonymous, possibly rogue AI development. I=
t just appeared one day in August, started beating everything else in blind=
 tests, and nobody knows who made it. The speculation that it's Google make=
s sense=E2=80=94they use fruit codenames, and the quality suggests serious =
resources=E2=80=94but the anonymous release is unprecedented. When you do c=
atch it on LM Arena, the experience is surreal. You watch it handle complex=
 multi-step edits that would crash other models, maintain perfect lighting =
consistency across dramatic changes, and preserve character features throug=
h impossible transformations. Then it disappears and you're back to using n=
ormal tools, wondering if you imagined it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's my practi=
cal advice: start with what's accessible. Runway, Kling, and HeyGen all off=
er reasonable entry points with trial credits or affordable tiers. You can =
learn the principles, develop your eye for what works, and build actual pro=
jects while waiting for broader access to the cutting-edge tools.</p><p sty=

 eventually land. Runway regularly incorporates techniques that were exclus=
ive to research models six months prior. By the time you get access to Veo =
or advanced Sora features, you'll understand how to use them effectively.</=

><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">Here's what actually happens when you're creating professiona=
l AI video content.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You start with clear intention and deta=
iled planning. Storyboard your sequences, define your visual style, specify=
 emotional beats. The tools are powerful but they're not mind readers. The =
clearer your vision, the better your results.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You generate =
extensively and select ruthlessly. For every shot in your final video, you =
might generate fifteen to twenty variations. This isn't because the tools a=
re unreliable=E2=80=94it's because they give you options you hadn't conside=
red. Sometimes variation seven has a camera angle that transforms the entir=
e emotional tone.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You use hybrid workflows. AI generation p=
lus traditional editing equals professional output. Generate your raw mater=
ial with AI, then use Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, or even simpler tools like=
 CapCut for timing, transitions, and final polish. The AI provides infinite=
 raw material; traditional editing provides precision control.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">You train custom models when it matters. Both Kling and HeyGen let you=
 train on your own appearance or specific visual styles. This isn't vanity=
=E2=80=94it's about consistency. If you need the same character across mult=
iple videos, or your brand requires specific visual language, custom traini=
ng is essential.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: rel=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Temporal cons=
istency remains challenging across longer sequences. Generating one amazing=
 shot is straightforward. Generating ten shots that feel like they're from =
the same film, with consistent lighting, physics, and character appearance=
=E2=80=94that requires significant post-production work.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Th=
e uncanny valley moved rather than disappeared. Instead of obviously fake f=
aces, we now have subtly wrong physics. A character's weight doesn't quite =
match their movement. Fabric behaves almost correctly. These micro-inconsis=
tencies create subconscious unease that you have to either minimize or deli=
berately leverage for effect.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Compute costs scale faster th=
an you expect. Professional projects can easily run hundreds of dollars in =
generation costs when you factor in all the iterations and experiments. Bud=
get accordingly.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Complex interactions between multiple elem=
ents remain difficult. A single person walking works great. Two people havi=
ng a conversation with consistent eye contact and natural body language? Mu=
ch harder. Crowds, complex choreography, precise object manipulation=E2=80=
=94these all require workarounds and multiple attempts.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Acc=
ess to the best tools remains frustratingly random. Nano-Banana appears and=
 disappears from LM Arena without warning. Sora access is still lottery-bas=
ed. Google Veo might be incredible but good luck getting in. You'll waste h=
ours refreshing platforms hoping to catch the good models when they're avai=
lable.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;font=

 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Based on=
 what I'm seeing in betas and research papers, here's what's coming in the =
next six to twelve months.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Real-time generation is almost h=
ere. We're moving from minutes to seconds for basic generation. Soon it'll =
be instantaneous for simple scenes. This changes everything about iteration=
 and creative exploration.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Consistency models are the next =
frontier. Companies are developing systems that maintain visual DNA across =
entire productions. Same physics, same lighting logic, same character detai=
ls=E2=80=94automatically maintained across hundreds of shots.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Control precision is improving dramatically. Instead of hoping the AI =
interprets your prompt correctly, you'll have granular control over camera =
movement, timing, emotional progression. Think of it as moving from spray-a=
nd-pray to actual cinematography.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Integration with traditio=

p an opinion about AI video tools now. Not because traditional methods are =
dying=E2=80=94they're not=E2=80=94but because the competitive landscape is =
shifting whether you participate or not.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=

ewsletter you know I=E2=80=99m a fan of the practical. Start with one tool.=
 Spend real time with it. Generate those hundred clips. Pay attention to wh=
at surprises you=E2=80=94when the AI creates something unexpected but bette=
r than your intention, study why. Those moments of generative serendipity a=
re where new visual languages emerge.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=

now because we're all figuring this out together. Your failed experiment mi=
ght solve someone else's problem.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Most importantly, underst=
and that these are tools, not replacements. The best AI video content I'm s=
eeing comes from people who understand visual storytelling, who have develo=
ped taste, who know why certain images resonate. The barrier to entry has l=
owered, but the ceiling for excellence remains high.</p><p style=3D"margin:=

ols are here. They work. The question isn't whether to use them, but how to=
 use them thoughtfully. The difference between AI tourism and actual creati=
on is intention, iteration, and the discipline to know when generated is go=
od enough and when it needs to be genuinely good.</p><div class=3D"subscrip=
