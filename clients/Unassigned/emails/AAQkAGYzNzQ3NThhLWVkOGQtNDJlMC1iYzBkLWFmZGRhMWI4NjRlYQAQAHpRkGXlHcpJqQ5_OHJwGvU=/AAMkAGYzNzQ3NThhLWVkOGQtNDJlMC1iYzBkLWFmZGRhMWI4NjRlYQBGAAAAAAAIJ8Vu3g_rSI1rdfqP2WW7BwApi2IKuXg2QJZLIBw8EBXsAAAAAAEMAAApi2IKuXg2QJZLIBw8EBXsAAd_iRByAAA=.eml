actually-works-at-startups

We=E2=80=99re all so busy trying to keep up with AI, we sometimes don=E2=80=
=99t stop to think.
As far as I know, no one has taken the time to study how AI adoption patter=
ns are unfolding differently at small companies vs. large companies in deta=
il=E2=80=94not with the goal of picking sides, but with the goal of underst=
anding the underlying patterns and learning what it can tell us about where=
 the AI revolution is going.
I've spent months looking for a thoughtful comparison of how AI actually wo=
rks at small startups versus large enterprises. It doesn't exist. What we h=
ave instead are two parallel conversations that rarely intersect=E2=80=94st=
artup founders describing their AI-native workflows as if enterprise constr=
aints don't matter, and enterprise leaders discussing governance frameworks=
 as if startup velocity isn't real.
The gap isn't from hostility; it's from living in different realities. When=
 Dan Shipper at Every builds entire products through conversations with Cla=
ude, and Sarah at her 400-person SaaS company spends six months getting Git=
Hub Copilot approved, they're both being rational. They're just optimizing =
for completely different things under completely different constraints.
I've been in both worlds. I've watched founders assign Linear tickets to AI=
 agents that work overnight while they sleep. I've also watched enterprise =
teams build elaborate approval processes for AI tools while their developer=
s secretly use ChatGPT through their browsers anyway. Both approaches make =
sense once you understand the context, but nobody's actually explaining tha=
t context or what each side could learn from the other.
What follows is that missing comparison. Here's what you'll find:
How AI-native startups actually work - Building through conversation, not c=
ode
The enterprise reality - Why 6 months for Copilot approval is sometimes the=
 best option=20
Technical stacks - Specific tools, costs, and why they diverge
Daily workflows - From overnight AI agents to AI sprints
Real costs - $10-15K/month in credits vs. enterprise contracts
5-minute quick starts - What to do today, regardless of company size
Culture shifts - Code ownership, team dynamics, institutional memory
Integration problems - Greenfield vs. legacy from 2008
What works - Patterns that succeed everywhere
For enterprise readers who need more than quick starts, I've compiled an 88=
-page implementation guide that translates startup innovations into enterpr=
ise-ready approaches. It covers tools that pass security review, governance=
 that enables rather than blocks, and change management that works with sen=
ior engineers who've seen every tech trend come and go. It's the detailed r=
oadmap for organizations that can't just rebuild everything from scratch.
The reality is that both startups and enterprises have figured out importan=
t pieces of the AI puzzle. Startups understand velocity and possibility. En=
terprises understand sustainability and scale. The future belongs to compan=
ies that can learn from both approaches. But first, we need to see clearly =
what's actually happening in each world, not the simplified versions we ass=
ume from the outside.

The Enterprise AI Implementation Guide [ https://substack.com/redirect/242d=
6197-1218-4024-af22-3fc4a9ecc6ce?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=
hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
If you're reading this from inside a company with more than 50 employees, y=
ou know the reality: everything I described about AI-native startups sounds=
 great until you remember you have SOX compliance, customer data that could=
 sink the company if leaked, and a CTO who (rightfully) wants to know exact=
ly what data is going where. You can't just cowboy your way into AI adoptio=
n when you have enterprise customers doing security audits and a board that=
 expects predictable quarterly results. That's why I've put together this 8=
8-page reference guide specifically for midsize and enterprise companies im=
plementing AI.=20
It's not about moving fast and breaking things=E2=80=94it's about moving de=
liberately while nothing breaks. This guide covers the actual tools that pa=
ss security review, the governance frameworks that satisfy compliance witho=
ut killing innovation, the change management approaches that work with seni=
or engineers who've been burned by hype before, and the specific architectu=
res that let you experiment safely while maintaining the stability your cus=
tomers depend on.=20
Think of it as the translation layer between startup innovation and enterpr=
ise reality=E2=80=94taking what works from the AI-native world and adapting=
 it to environments where "we'll fix it in production" isn't an option. Bec=
ause the truth is, enterprises aren't slower at AI adoption because they're=
 stupid or scared. They're slower because they're solving a fundamentally h=
arder problem: transforming a flying airplane without crashing it.
How AI-Native Startups Actually Work (And Why Enterprise AI Looks Nothing L=
ike It)
I've been scrolling through endless articles on AI adoption, and they all s=
eem to miss the same thing. They treat AI transformation like it's one phen=
omenon, as if a two-person startup in San Francisco and a 500-person compan=
y in Ohio are playing the same game. They're not. Not even close.
The gap hit me when I started comparing notes between founders building AI-=
first startups and product leaders trying to transform mid-market companies=
=2E The startups are running entire eng=
ineering workflows through Claude Code=
 and Devin, treating AI agents like employees with Linear tickets and perfo=
rmance reviews. Meanwhile, the enterprises are... still debating whether to=
 allow ChatGPT on the company network.
But here's what's interesting: both approaches make perfect sense once you =
understand the constraints they're operating under. The startup founder isn=
't being reckless, and the enterprise IT director isn't being overly cautio=
us. They're responding rationally to completely different realities. And th=
ose realities shape everything=E2=80=94from the tools they choose to the wa=
y they think about what AI even is.
So I want to work through what I've been seeing, comparing these two worlds=
, because I think the lessons from each side are more nuanced than anyone's=
 admitting. The startups have figured out things about AI velocity that ent=
erprises need to learn. But the enterprises understand something about sust=
ainable AI adoption that most startups are too rushed to notice.
The Reality of AI-Native Development
Let me start with Dan Shipper, because his approach at Every captures somet=
hing fundamental about how AI-native companies actually work. Every is tech=
nically a media company, but they've morphed into something more like an AI=
 product lab. When Shipper builds features now, he doesn't open an IDE. He =
has a conversation with Claude Code about what he wants, and the feature em=
erges through dialogue.
This isn't him being lazy or cutting corners. It's a different philosophy o=
f creation. He calls it "compounding engineering"=E2=80=94each feature you =
build with AI makes the next one easier, because the AI understands your co=
debase better, your patterns, your preferences. The code becomes a living t=
hing that grows through conversation rather than keystrokes.
His team runs what they call Claude Code Camps. Non-engineers show up and s=
hip production features. The head of marketing can now build product featur=
es. The operations lead creates internal tools. This would be unthinkable a=
t a traditional company, but at Every, it's just Tuesday. They built their =
entire search product, Spiral, this way=E2=80=94using a stack of ChatGPT fo=
r initial coding, Clerk for authentication, Supabase for the database, Rail=
way for hosting, and the Claude API for the AI functionality. Not a prototy=
pe=E2=80=94the actual product that customers pay for.
Claire Vo takes this even further at ChatPRD. She assigns Linear tickets di=
rectly to Devin, an AI agent that handles entire features autonomously. Whe=
n I first heard this, I thought she was exaggerating. She's not. Devin work=
s through the night, pushing code to staging for her review in the morning.=
 When she finds issues, she doesn't fix them herself. She creates a new tic=
ket explaining the problem and assigns it back to Devin or another agent.
Her stack is deliberately diverse: Cursor for backend API work and summarie=
s, ChatGPT for quick conversions (like turning PDFs into .ics calendar file=
s), Lovable for vibe-coding prototypes, and Gemini Flash specifically for v=
ideo analysis in her podcast workflows. She uses MCP (Model Context Protoco=
l) to connect these tools=E2=80=94her agents can query Segment data directl=
y, bypassing Google Analytics entirely. The SQL queries happen through MCP =
connections, no dashboard needed.
The workflow looks bizarre from the outside. She'll check what Devin comple=
ted overnight, review the staging deploys, create tickets for issues, assig=
n them to various AI agents, then move on to strategic work while the agent=
s handle implementation. It's like managing a team, except half the team do=
esn't need sleep or salary negotiations.
This extends to how they validate ideas. Vo doesn't spend weeks on an MVP. =
She "vibe-codes" a prototype in Lovable or v0=E2=80=94describing the genera=
l vibe of what she wants and letting the AI figure out the details. An hour=
 later, she has something real enough to show users. If they hate it, she's=
 lost an hour. If they love it, she can build the real version, or more lik=
ely, just iterate on the prototype until it becomes the real version.
The code quality for a demo like that would horrify traditional engineers. =
Functions are too long. There's duplicate code everywhere. Abstractions are=
 minimal. But when you can regenerate an entire component in seconds by des=
cribing what you want differently, code quality means something different. =
It's not about crafting perfect abstractions that will last for years. It's=
 about solving today's problem as quickly as possible, knowing you can comp=
letely rewrite it tomorrow if needed.
The Enterprise Reality Check
Now let me tell you about a product director I know at a 400-person B2B Saa=
S company. Let's call her Sarah. She's trying to integrate AI into their pr=
oduct, and her reality looks nothing like Shipper's or Vo's.
Sarah's first attempt was to get her team access to GitHub Copilot. Three m=
onths of security reviews. Another month of procurement negotiations. Two m=
onths of pilot testing with a small group. By the time it rolled out, half =
the team had already been using ChatGPT on their personal accounts anyway, =
copying and pasting code through their browsers, completely defeating the s=
ecurity review's purpose.
But here's the thing: Sarah's not being unreasonable. Her company handles h=
ealthcare data. They have SOX compliance requirements. They have enterprise=
 customers who audit their security practices. One data leak through an AI =
tool, and they lose their biggest contracts. The stakes are fundamentally d=
ifferent from a startup that can pivot if something goes wrong.
When Sarah's team finally got AI tooling approved, it wasn't Devin or Claud=
e Code. It was Azure OpenAI, locked down with specific data handling agreem=
ents, integrated through their existing Microsoft infrastructure. The devel=
opers can use it, but only through approved interfaces, with all prompts lo=
gged for audit purposes. It's AI with training wheels, guardrails, and a sa=
fety net.
The cultural challenge is even bigger than the technical one. Sarah's senio=
r engineers have spent decades perfecting their craft. They've built sophis=
ticated mental models of how software should be architected. Now they're be=
ing asked to delegate to an AI that makes mistakes they wouldn't have made =
as junior engineers. One senior developer told her, "I didn't spend 20 year=
s learning to code just to become a prompt engineer."
She tried running AI workshops, bringing in consultants, creating innovatio=
n time for experimentation. But the adoption was sporadic. The junior devel=
opers loved it=E2=80=94they were shipping faster than ever. The senior deve=
lopers used it occasionally, usually just for boilerplate code. Middle mana=
gement was terrified it would make their teams redundant.
The successful adoptions in her company followed a pattern: they happened i=
n pockets where there was already pain. The support team, drowning in ticke=
ts, embraced AI categorization and response drafting immediately. The QA te=
am, perpetually behind, jumped on AI-assisted test generation. The document=
ation team, chronically understaffed, became AI power users within weeks. B=
ut the core product development team? Still debating whether AI-generated c=
ode meets their quality standards.
The Technical Stack Divergence
The tool choices between these two worlds reveal their different priorities=
=2E Let me walk through the actual stac=
ks I'm seeing, with the specific detai=
ls that matter.
Startups are running what I call a "diversified chaos" strategy. They use r=
outers=E2=80=94OpenRouter or Together AI=E2=80=94to dynamically switch betw=
een models. Claude Opus for deep research and complex reasoning (Shipper sp=
awns parallel Claude agents for this), GPT-4 for quick coding tasks, Gemini=
 Flash for anything multimodal, and open-source models like Llama 3.2 or Qw=
en for production where they need to control costs. They're not loyal to an=
y provider; they're loyal to whatever works best for the specific task at h=
and.
The database layer is surprisingly consistent: Postgres with pgvector exten=
sion for vector embeddings, hosted on either Neon or Supabase. Not because =
it's trendy, but because it's pragmatic. You start with one database for ev=
erything, add vector search without a migration, and can scale pretty far b=
efore needing to specialize. Redis through Upstash handles caching and job =
queues. Media files go to AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2. As you scale, you might =
add Pinecone or Weaviate for specialized vector search, but most startups n=
ever need to.
The agent orchestration layer is where things get interesting. MCP (Model C=
ontext Protocol) has become the unexpected winner for connecting agents to =
tools and data. LangChain or Semantic Kernel handle the workflow orchestrat=
ion and memory management. AutoGen comes in when you need true multi-agent =
collaboration. But here's the key: they start simple. Vo began with basic L=
inear integrations for Devin, then gradually built up to complex agent hand=
offs. Shipper started with single Claude calls, then evolved to spawning pa=
rallel agents with custom handoff libraries.
For observability, it's LangSmith and Helicone from day one. These aren't n=
ice-to-haves; they're essential. When you're burning $10-15K per month in A=
I credits, you need to know exactly where every dollar goes. Which prompts =
are expensive? Which chains are inefficient? Which models are hallucinating=
? PostHog tracks user analytics, Sentry catches errors, and Braintrust prov=
ides deeper observability for complex chains.
The development stack is Next.js with TypeScript for full-stack apps, Tailw=
ind with Shadcn components for UI, Prisma for database interactions. But th=
e interesting part is how they build: Cursor for AI-assisted coding when th=
ey need control, Devin for autonomous feature development when they can spe=
cify clearly, Claude Code for complex refactoring and architectural work. F=
or rapid prototyping, it's Bolt, v0, Lovable, or Replit=E2=80=94whatever ge=
ts them from idea to demo fastest.
Infrastructure runs on credits and simplicity. AWS Bedrock when they have s=
tartup credits, Vercel for Next.js hosting, Cloudflare for everything edge-=
related. Railway or Render for backend services. Supabase often handles aut=
h, database, and real-time subscriptions in one package. Stripe for payment=
s, always Stripe. The pattern is clear: minimize the number of services you=
 need to understand and maintain.
Mid-market companies take the opposite approach: single-vendor depth. They =
pick Azure OpenAI or AWS Bedrock and build everything around it. Their data=
base might still be Postgres, but it's probably on Azure Database or AWS RD=
S with enterprise support contracts. They add specialized vector databases =
like Pinecone not because they need the performance, but because it came as=
 part of an enterprise AI platform bundle.
The development tools are more conservative: GitHub Copilot for code assist=
ance (after those months of security review), existing IDEs with AI plugins=
 rather than new AI-first editors. They might experiment with tools like Cu=
rsor in sandboxed environments, but production code still goes through trad=
itional development workflows.
The Workflow Revolution
The daily workflow differences between these environments reveal completely=
 different philosophies of work. In AI-native startups, the boundary betwee=
n thinking and building has essentially dissolved. When Shipper has an idea=
 for a feature, he starts talking to Claude about it. That conversation bec=
omes specification, which becomes code, which becomes the deployed feature=
=E2=80=94all in one continuous flow.
The specific workflow at Every looks like this: Shipper opens Claude Code, =
describes the feature he wants in natural language, references existing cod=
e patterns in their codebase, and lets Claude generate the implementation. =
He reviews it conversationally=E2=80=94"that's good but change X to Y"=E2=
=80=94rather than editing code directly. The feature gets deployed to Railw=
ay with a simple command. Total time from idea to production: often under a=
n hour.
Vo's workflow with Devin is even more radical. She starts her morning by re=
viewing Devin's overnight work in Linear. The agent has been assigned ticke=
ts with detailed acceptance criteria and context about the codebase. Devin =
works through them, commits code to feature branches, and updates ticket st=
atus with implementation notes. When it gets stuck, it adds comments explai=
ning what it tried and what's blocking it.
Her prompt templates for Devin are elaborate and worth understanding. They =
include: project context, codebase conventions, common patterns to follow, =
libraries to prefer, and even tone for code comments. She's essentially tra=
ining Devin to be a team member who understands not just what to build but =
how to build it in a way that fits with everything else.
But this workflow depends on a tolerance for imperfection that most enterpr=
ises can't afford. The dashboard that founder built during a user call was =
functional but not production-ready. It handled the happy path perfectly bu=
t would probably break under edge cases. The database queries weren't optim=
ized. The error handling was basic. For a startup with 10 customers, that's=
 fine=E2=80=94they can fix issues as they arise. For an enterprise with 10,=
000 customers, that's a disaster waiting to happen.
The enterprise workflow remains more structured, and there are good reasons=
 for this. They use AI to accelerate existing processes rather than replace=
 them. A developer might use Copilot to write unit tests faster, but those =
tests still go through code review. A product manager might use ChatGPT to =
draft requirements, but they still go through stakeholder review. AI become=
s a productivity tool rather than a transformation agent.
Sarah's team found a middle ground that's interesting. They created what th=
ey call "AI sprints"=E2=80=94one-week periods where they throw normal proce=
sses out the window and build like a startup. No code reviews, no lengthy s=
pecifications, just rapid building with AI assistance. At the end of the we=
ek, they demo everything, pick the best ideas, and then rebuild them proper=
ly for production. It gives them startup-style velocity in controlled burst=
s without sacrificing their production standards.
The Cost Reality
Nobody talks honestly about the economics of AI-native development, so let =
me put some real numbers on the table. Vo's team burns through $10,000-15,0=
00 per month in AI credits. Shipper's closer to $8,000. These aren't huge c=
ompanies=E2=80=94they're small teams shipping products that compete with mu=
ch larger competitors.
The breakdown is illuminating. About 40% goes to production inference=E2=80=
=94actual user-facing AI features. Another 30% goes to development=E2=80=94=
all those conversations with Claude Code, iterations with Devin, experiment=
s that don't work out. 20% is pure experimentation and learning. The last 1=
0% is usually "what the hell happened here"=E2=80=94runaway chains, infinit=
e loops, that one time someone accidentally had GPT-4 analyze their entire =
codebase repeatedly for six hours.
At first glance, that seems insane. You could hire a junior developer for t=
hat. But that's the wrong comparison. That $10,000 is giving them the equiv=
alent of 3-4 developers working 24/7, never taking breaks, never needing on=
boarding, never having bad days. The velocity math works out overwhelmingly=
 in AI's favor.
But there's a hidden cost that startups don't talk about: the technical deb=
t accumulation is massive. When you can regenerate any component in minutes=
, you stop thinking about long-term architecture. When AI can refactor anyt=
hing instantly, you stop worrying about code organization. This works until=
 it doesn't. I've seen startups hit a wall where the AI can no longer under=
stand their codebase because it's become such a mess of AI-generated spaghe=
tti.
One founder told me about hitting this wall at around 100,000 lines of code=
=2E The AI started making increasingly=20=
bizarre suggestions, unable to underst=
and the patterns it had created. They had to stop feature development for a=
 month and manually refactor with human developers to create some conceptua=
l clarity. It was like the code had developed dementia.
Enterprises have the opposite problem. They're so worried about technical d=
ebt that they're barely accumulating any code at all. Sarah's team spent si=
x months on an AI implementation that a startup would have shipped in a wee=
k. But their version handles edge cases, has proper error handling, include=
s comprehensive tests, and integrates with their existing monitoring. It's =
bulletproof where the startup version is held together with hope.
The 5-Minute Quick Action Guide
If you're reading this and want to experiment with AI-native development, h=
ere's what you can do in the next five minutes to get started:
For Startup Founders:
Right now: Sign up for Claude Code (claude.ai) and OpenRouter (openrouter.a=
i). You need both=E2=80=94Claude for deep work, OpenRouter for model flexib=
ility.
First prompt: Take your current biggest technical problem and describe it t=
o Claude in plain English. Don't write requirements; have a conversation. "=
I need a dashboard that shows user activity over time, pulls from our Postg=
res database, and updates in real-time."
First integration: Connect one AI agent to your workflow today. If you use =
Linear, create a label called "AI-Ready" and write one ticket as if you're =
assigning it to a junior developer. Try assigning it to Devin (devin.ai) or=
 continue the conversation with Claude.
First measurement: Install Helicone (helicone.ai) or LangSmith. Every AI ca=
ll should be traced from day one. You'll burn money fast without visibility=
=2E
First experiment: Take your next feature request and try building it entire=
ly through AI conversation before writing any code manually. Time it. Compa=
re to your normal process.
For Enterprise Teams:
Right now: Create an AI sandbox=E2=80=94a separate environment with non-pro=
duction data where your team can experiment without compliance concerns.
First safe bet: Start with your documentation. Have your best technical wri=
ter spend 5 minutes with ChatGPT turning meeting notes into technical specs=
=2E Low risk, immediate value.
First integration: If you have Azure, enable Azure OpenAI. If you have AWS,=
 enable Bedrock. Use your existing vendor relationships=E2=80=94you probabl=
y already have credits you don't know about.
First champion: Identify your most overwhelmed team (usually QA or support)=
=2E Give them a $500/month AI budget an=
d freedom to experiment. They'll becom=
e your internal evangelists.
First metric: Track time-to-first-line-of-code for new features. Not time t=
o ship, just time to start building. Watch how AI changes this number.
For Everyone:
The meta-action: Stop thinking about AI as a better autocomplete. Start thi=
nking about it as a junior team member who never sleeps, never complains, a=
nd gets smarter every week. That mental model shift matters more than any s=
pecific tool.
The Cultural Transformation
The cultural differences run deeper than just risk tolerance. AI-native sta=
rtups have developed entirely new cultural norms around creation and owners=
hip. At Every, nobody "owns" code anymore. The code is communal, constantly=
 being rewritten by whoever needs to change it, with AI as the medium of ch=
ange. There's no ego in implementation because implementation has become co=
mmoditized.
This creates interesting dynamics. Shipper told me about a feature that thr=
ee different people had rewritten completely in the span of a week, each ti=
me to add their own functionality. In a traditional environment, this would=
 cause conflicts=E2=80=94people would feel their work was being disrespecte=
d. At Every, it's just iteration. The code is disposable; the functionality=
 is what matters.
The flip side is that institutional knowledge becomes fragmented. When I as=
ked how they onboard new developers, Shipper laughed. "We point them to Cla=
ude and tell them to start asking questions." The AI has become the institu=
tional memory, the documentation, and the onboarding process all in one. It=
 works, but it's fragile. If they ever had to switch AI providers, they'd l=
ose not just a tool but their entire organizational memory.
Enterprises can't operate this way, and honestly, they shouldn't try. They =
have different cultural strengths that AI can amplify rather than replace. =
Sarah's team has deep domain expertise in healthcare workflows that no AI c=
urrently understands. They have relationships with customers that span deca=
des. They have hard-won knowledge about edge cases that only appear at scal=
e.
The successful enterprise AI adoptions I've seen acknowledge these strength=
s. They use AI to amplify human expertise rather than replace it. A senior =
developer with 20 years of experience becomes even more valuable when they =
can implement their ideas 10x faster with AI assistance. A product manager =
who deeply understands customer needs becomes more powerful when they can p=
rototype solutions in hours instead of weeks.
But this requires a different kind of cultural change. It's not about makin=
g everyone an AI user; it's about making AI invisible. The best enterprise =
implementations I've seen hide the AI entirely. The support team doesn't th=
ink they're using AI; they just notice their ticket system got smarter. The=
 QA team doesn't prompt engineer; they just find their test coverage improv=
ed.
The Talent Equation
The talent implications of AI-native development are profound and underdisc=
ussed. Startups are hiring differently now. Vo told me she no longer looks =
for coding ability in junior hires. She looks for clear thinking and good t=
aste. "I can teach anyone to prompt engineer in a day," she said. "I can't =
teach them to know what good looks like."
This is creating a new class of technical workers=E2=80=94people who can bu=
ild software but can't necessarily code. They understand systems, architect=
ure, user experience, but they implement through conversation with AI rathe=
r than through writing code. It's like the difference between an architect =
and a construction worker, except the AI is doing the construction instantl=
y.
Traditional engineers often hate this. They see it as a devaluation of thei=
r craft. And they're not wrong=E2=80=94traditional coding skills are becomi=
ng less valuable in purely economic terms. But what's becoming more valuabl=
e is the ability to think systemically, to understand complex interactions,=
 to debug at a conceptual level rather than a syntax level. The engineers w=
ho thrive in this new world are the ones who were always more interested in=
 solving problems than writing code.
Enterprises face a different talent challenge. They have teams of engineers=
 with deep technical skills who need to transform into AI orchestrators. It=
's not just a skill change; it's an identity change. Sarah described it as =
"asking Formula 1 drivers to become traffic controllers." They have the dom=
ain knowledge, but the job has fundamentally changed.
The successful transformations I've seen create hybrid roles. Senior engine=
ers become AI architects, designing systems that AI implements. Junior deve=
lopers become AI trainers, creating the examples and patterns that AI learn=
s from. Product managers become AI conductors, orchestrating multiple AI ag=
ents to deliver features.
But there's also a talent exodus happening that nobody talks about. The mos=
t ambitious engineers are leaving enterprises for AI-native startups, not f=
or better pay, but for the ability to build at AI speed. One engineer told =
me, "I can build more in a weekend at a startup than I built in a year at m=
y last company." The velocity is addictive.
The Quality Question
Let's address the elephant in the room: AI-generated code is often terrible=
=2E It's verbose, repetitive, and fille=
d with subtle bugs. It confidently imp=
lements antipatterns. It occasionally hallucinates entire libraries that do=
n't exist. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.
But here's what I've learned: it doesn't matter as much as we think it does=
=2E The startups shipping AI-generated=20=
code aren't succeeding because the cod=
e is good. They're succeeding because they can iterate so fast that quality=
 becomes an emergent property rather than a designed one.
Vo explained it this way: "We ship broken things quickly, see how they brea=
k, then fix them even more quickly. By the time a traditional team would ha=
ve shipped v1, we're on v20." The broken versions that users never see don'=
t matter. The rapid convergence on something that works does.
This is antithetical to enterprise software development, where the first ve=
rsion needs to work reliably for thousands of users. Sarah's team can't shi=
p something that might break; their customers depend on their software for =
critical operations. So they use AI differently=E2=80=94for exploration and=
 prototyping, but not for production code without significant human review.
The quality gap is closing though. Each new generation of AI models produce=
s notably better code. Claude 3.5 writes code that's markedly better than C=
laude 3. GPT-4 understands architectural patterns that GPT-3.5 couldn't gra=
sp. At the current rate of improvement, we're probably 18 months from AI-ge=
nerated code being indistinguishable from human-written code for most appli=
cations.
But I think focusing on code quality misses the bigger point. The value isn=
't in the code; it's in the ability to explore solution spaces rapidly. AI =
allows you to try 20 different approaches in the time it would take to impl=
ement one traditionally. Most will be wrong, but you learn something from e=
ach failure. The winners aren't the ones who write the best code; they're t=
he ones who find the right solution fastest.
The Integration Challenge
One pattern I keep seeing: the hardest part isn't getting AI to work; it's =
getting it to work with everything else. Startups have it easy here=E2=80=
=94they're building greenfield, so they can design their entire system arou=
nd AI from the start. Everything is API-first, documentation-light, AI-frie=
ndly.
Enterprises are trying to integrate AI into systems built over decades, wit=
h complex dependencies, undocumented behaviors, and fragile integrations. S=
arah's team spent three months just figuring out how to get AI-generated co=
de to work with their legacy authentication system. The AI kept suggesting =
modern patterns that were incompatible with decisions made in 2008.
The successful enterprise integrations I've seen take a strangler fig appro=
ach=E2=80=94they wrap existing systems with AI-friendly interfaces, then gr=
adually replace the internals. One company built what they called an "AI tr=
anslation layer"=E2=80=94a service that converts between their legacy syste=
ms and modern AI tools. It's not elegant, but it works.
The data integration is even messier. Startups design their data schemas to=
 be AI-readable from the start. They use clear naming conventions, consiste=
nt patterns, extensive comments. Enterprises are working with databases tha=
t have columns named things like "custID_v2_final_REAL" because of migratio=
ns from 15 years ago. The AI takes one look and hallucinates.
I've seen enterprises succeed by creating "AI views" of their data=E2=80=94=
cleaned, normalized, documented versions specifically for AI consumption. I=
t's duplicate work, but it's the only way to make progress without rebuildi=
ng everything. One CTO told me, "We're essentially building a parallel univ=
erse where everything makes sense, then slowly migrating reality to match i=
t."
The Practical Stack Details
Let me give you the specific details of what's actually working in producti=
on, because the implementation details matter more than the high-level stra=
tegy.
For voice and video work, the stack is surprisingly consistent: Deepgram fo=
r speech-to-text (better accuracy than Whisper for real-time), ElevenLabs f=
or text-to-speech (most natural voices), LiveKit for WebRTC streaming, and =
Twilio for telephony integration. Vo specifically uses Gemini Flash for vid=
eo analysis in her podcast workflows=E2=80=94it can transcribe and summariz=
e hour-long videos in seconds. For programmatic video generation, Remotion =
is the winner, letting you write React components that become videos.
Authentication and payments are solved problems: Clerk or Supabase Auth for=
 authentication (Clerk if you want it done for you, Supabase if you want co=
ntrol), Stripe for payments (always Stripe, don't overthink this). The inte=
resting part is how AI companies are using these=E2=80=94Shipper has Claude=
 generate Stripe integration code that handles complex subscription logic h=
e would have spent days implementing manually.
For productivity and automation, the stack depends on team size. Solo found=
ers live in Notion with AI plugins, use Zapier or Make for automation, and =
manage everything through Linear (which has the best AI agent integrations)=
=2E Larger teams add Slack with custom=20=
AI bots, Framer for marketing pages (A=
I can generate these directly), and increasingly sophisticated automations.=
 Vo has entire workflows where Zapier watches for new Linear tickets, trigg=
ers Devin, which updates Slack when done.
The development environment is where the real innovation is happening. Curs=
or has become the default for AI-assisted coding when you want to maintain =
control=E2=80=94it's VS Code with deep AI integration. For autonomous devel=
opment, Devin is the clear winner for complete features, while Claude Code =
excels at refactoring and architectural work. The low-code tools=E2=80=94Bo=
lt, v0, Lovable, Replit=E2=80=94each have sweet spots. v0 for UI components=
, Lovable for complete apps, Bolt for interactive prototypes, Replit for fu=
ll-stack applications with hosting included.
The Governance Gap
The governance challenges are where the startup and enterprise worlds diver=
ge most dramatically. Startups have essentially no governance. Vo admitted =
to me that she has no idea what data has been sent to which AI providers. "=
We probably should track that," she said, "but we're too busy shipping." Th=
is is terrifying from an enterprise perspective but liberating from a start=
up perspective.
Enterprises are building elaborate governance frameworks=E2=80=94prompt lib=
raries, approval workflows, audit trails. Every AI interaction is logged, r=
eviewed, and archived. They have committees to approve new use cases. They =
have training programs on responsible AI use. It's thorough, careful, and i=
ncredibly slow.
But unexpected governance patterns are emerging. Some startups are building=
 in governance from the start, not because they have to, but because it mak=
es the AI work better. Shipper showed me their prompt versioning system=E2=
=80=94every prompt is tracked, versioned, and measured for effectiveness. I=
t started as an optimization tool but became a de facto governance system.
Meanwhile, some enterprises are creating "governance-free zones"=E2=80=94sa=
ndbox environments where teams can experiment without restrictions. Sarah's=
 company has an "AI playground" where developers can try anything as long a=
s it doesn't touch production data. It's become their most valuable learnin=
g environment.
The regulatory landscape is forcing everyone to think about governance diff=
erently. European companies are already adapting to AI regulations that Ame=
rican companies are just starting to consider. One founder told me they're =
building their entire AI system to be "regulation-ready"=E2=80=94able to co=
mply with whatever rules emerge. It's constraining in the short term but mi=
ght be an advantage long term.
What Actually Works
After all this analysis, let me tell you what actually works. The successfu=
l AI adoptions, whether startup or enterprise, share some common patterns t=
hat transcend their differences.
First, they all start with pain. The teams that successfully adopt AI are t=
he ones that have a specific, acute problem that AI can solve. Vo started u=
sing AI because she was drowning in product requirements. Shipper adopted i=
t because he needed to ship faster than his competition. Sarah's successful=
 adoptions happened where teams were overwhelmed. Without real pain, AI bec=
omes a toy rather than a tool.
Second, they iterate in public. The successful teams ship their AI experime=
nts where users can see them, get feedback, and improve quickly. They don't=
 spend months perfecting things in private. Even enterprises are learning t=
o do this=E2=80=94Sarah's team now has a "beta" section of their product wh=
ere AI features appear first, with clear warnings about experimental status=
=2E
Third, they measure differently. Traditional metrics like code coverage or =
performance benchmarks matter less than velocity metrics. How fast can you =
go from idea to deployed feature? How quickly can you respond to user feedb=
ack? How many experiments can you run per week? The teams winning with AI o=
ptimize for learning speed over execution quality.
Fourth, they build AI-first workflows rather than AI-enhanced workflows. Th=
e difference is subtle but crucial. AI-enhanced means taking your existing =
process and adding AI to parts of it. AI-first means redesigning your proce=
ss around AI capabilities. Vo doesn't write specifications that AI implemen=
ts; she has conversations that become specifications and implementations si=
multaneously.
Fifth, they accept imperfection as a feature, not a bug. The successful tea=
ms have learned that 80% solutions shipped today beat 100% solutions shippe=
d next quarter. They've internalized that perfect is the enemy of good enou=
gh, and AI makes good enough achievable in hours instead of weeks.
The Future State
Looking forward, I see these two worlds=E2=80=94startup and enterprise=E2=
=80=94beginning to learn from each other in interesting ways. Startups are =
starting to realize they need some governance and structure as they scale. =
Enterprises are recognizing that their careful approach might be causing th=
em to miss the AI revolution entirely.
The next generation of tools is being built for this convergence. I'm seein=
g AI platforms that combine startup-style velocity with enterprise-grade go=
vernance. They let you move fast while maintaining audit trails. They enabl=
e experimentation while ensuring compliance. They're trying to give you the=
 best of both worlds.
But I think the bigger change is conceptual. We're moving from thinking abo=
ut AI as a tool to thinking about it as a medium. Just as the internet wasn=
't just a faster way to send mail but became an entirely new medium for hum=
an interaction, AI isn't just a faster way to write code=E2=80=94it's becom=
ing a new medium for creating software.
The companies that understand this shift will thrive. They won't just use A=
I to do their existing work faster; they'll reimagine what work means in an=
 AI-saturated environment. They'll build organizations that are native to t=
his new medium rather than adapted to it.
The startups have an advantage here=E2=80=94they're already native. But ent=
erprises have their own advantages=E2=80=94resources, customers, domain exp=
ertise=E2=80=94that could be decisive if they can figure out how to leverag=
e them in this new world. The winners won't be the ones who are most aggres=
sive or most careful with AI. They'll be the ones who best understand their=
 own constraints and opportunities, and design their AI adoption accordingl=
y.
The Personal Reality
Let me end with something personal, because I think it matters. I've been b=
uilding with AI for the past year, and it's changed how I think about creat=
ion in ways I'm still processing. I used to take pride in crafting elegant =
code, in understanding every line of what I built. Now I often don't fully =
understand the code running in production=E2=80=94I understand what it does=
, but not always how.
This was disturbing at first. It felt like cheating, like I was pretending =
to be technical while actually being something else. But I've come to reali=
ze that I'm not becoming less technical; I'm becoming differently technical=
=2E I'm operating at a higher level of=20=
abstraction, thinking in systems and b=
ehaviors rather than syntax and functions.
The founders I've talked to describe similar transitions. They're not codin=
g less; they're coding differently. They're not building less; they're buil=
ding more. They're not less technical; they're technical in a new way that =
we don't quite have words for yet.
This transition is hard, especially for those of us who built our identitie=
s around traditional technical skills. But it's also liberating. I can buil=
d things now that I could only dream about before. I can explore ideas that=
 would have taken months to validate. I can create at the speed of thought =
rather than the speed of typing.
The enterprise folks going through this transition have it harder in some w=
ays. They have more to unlearn, more identity to reconstruct. But they also=
 have something valuable=E2=80=94the wisdom to know what actually matters. =
They understand that technology is only useful insofar as it serves human n=
eeds. They know that the hardest problems aren't technical but organization=
al. They have the maturity to adopt AI thoughtfully rather than frantically=
=2E
The Real Lesson
If there's one thing I've learned from comparing these worlds, it's that th=
ere's no single right way to adopt AI. The startup approach works for start=
ups because they're optimizing for learning and velocity in an uncertain en=
vironment. The enterprise approach works for enterprises because they're op=
timizing for reliability and scalability in a complex environment.
The mistake is trying to copy the wrong model. I see enterprises trying to =
move at startup speed and burning out their teams. I see startups trying to=
 implement enterprise governance and grinding to a halt. The successful ado=
ptions happen when organizations understand their own context and design th=
eir AI strategy accordingly.
But there's also a meta-lesson here about technological change. We're in a =
moment where the old rules don't quite apply but the new rules haven't been=
 written. The startups are writing those rules through experimentation. The=
 enterprises are testing which rules can bend and which will break. Both ar=
e necessary for us to collectively figure out how to build in this new worl=
d.
The founders I've talked to aren't just building products; they're building=
 the patterns that everyone will use in five years. The enterprise leaders =
aren't just being careful; they're establishing the governance frameworks t=
hat will keep AI development sustainable. We need both the cowboys and the =
shepherds, the explorers and the settlers.
What we don't need is more generic advice about AI adoption. We need specif=
ic, contextual, honest accounts of what works and what doesn't, for whom an=
d under what circumstances. We need to stop pretending there's a playbook a=
nd start admitting we're all figuring this out as we go.
The AI-native startups have something to teach us about velocity and possib=
ility. The enterprises have something to teach us about sustainability and =
responsibility. The future belongs to those who can learn from both, adapti=
ng the lessons to their own context rather than blindly copying either mode=
l.
We're not just adopting a new technology. We're developing a new way of cre=
ating, a new relationship with our tools, a new understanding of what it me=
ans to build. The companies that recognize this=E2=80=94whether startup or =
enterprise=E2=80=94are the ones that will define the next decade of softwar=
e development.

tation Guide</a></em></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If you're reading this from inside a=
 company with more than 50 employees, you know the reality: everything I de=
scribed about AI-native startups sounds great until you remember you have S=
OX compliance, customer data that could sink the company if leaked, and a C=
TO who (rightfully) wants to know exactly what data is going where. You can=
't just cowboy your way into AI adoption when you have enterprise customers=
 doing security audits and a board that expects predictable quarterly resul=
ts. That's why I've put together this 88-page reference guide specifically =
for midsize and enterprise companies implementing AI. </p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It's=
 not about moving fast and breaking things=E2=80=94it's about moving delibe=
rately while nothing breaks. This guide covers the actual tools that pass s=
ecurity review, the governance frameworks that satisfy compliance without k=
illing innovation, the change management approaches that work with senior e=
ngineers who've been burned by hype before, and the specific architectures =
that let you experiment safely while maintaining the stability your custome=
rs depend on. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think of it as the translation layer between=
 startup innovation and enterprise reality=E2=80=94taking what works from t=
he AI-native world and adapting it to environments where &quot;we'll fix it=
 in production&quot; isn't an option. Because the truth is, enterprises are=
n't slower at AI adoption because they're stupid or scared. They're slower =
because they're solving a fundamentally harder problem: transforming a flyi=
ng airplane without crashing it.</p><h1 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

1><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=
t-size: 16px;">I've been scrolling through endless articles on AI adoption,=
 and they all seem to miss the same thing. They treat AI transformation lik=
e it's one phenomenon, as if a two-person startup in San Francisco and a 50=
0-person company in Ohio are playing the same game. They're not. Not even c=
lose.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">The gap hit me when I started comparing notes between=
 founders building AI-first startups and product leaders trying to transfor=
m mid-market companies. The startups are running entire engineering workflo=
ws through Claude Code and Devin, treating AI agents like employees with Li=
near tickets and performance reviews. Meanwhile, the enterprises are... sti=
ll debating whether to allow ChatGPT on the company network.</p><p style=3D=
"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;=
">But here's what's interesting: both approaches make perfect sense once yo=
u understand the constraints they're operating under. The startup founder i=
sn't being reckless, and the enterprise IT director isn't being overly caut=
ious. They're responding rationally to completely different realities. And =
those realities shape everything=E2=80=94from the tools they choose to the =
way they think about what AI even is.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So I want to work thr=
ough what I've been seeing, comparing these two worlds, because I think the=
 lessons from each side are more nuanced than anyone's admitting. The start=
ups have figured out things about AI velocity that enterprises need to lear=
n. But the enterprises understand something about sustainable AI adoption t=
hat most startups are too rushed to notice.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-p=

eality of AI-Native Development</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Let me start with=
 Dan Shipper, because his approach at Every captures something fundamental =
about how AI-native companies actually work. Every is technically a media c=
ompany, but they've morphed into something more like an AI product lab. Whe=
n Shipper builds features now, he doesn't open an IDE. He has a conversatio=
n with Claude Code about what he wants, and the feature emerges through dia=
logue.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn't him being lazy or cutting corners. It's a=
 different philosophy of creation. He calls it &quot;compounding engineerin=
g&quot;=E2=80=94each feature you build with AI makes the next one easier, b=
ecause the AI understands your codebase better, your patterns, your prefere=
nces. The code becomes a living thing that grows through conversation rathe=
r than keystrokes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">His team runs what they call Claude Code=
 Camps. Non-engineers show up and ship production features. The head of mar=
keting can now build product features. The operations lead creates internal=
 tools. This would be unthinkable at a traditional company, but at Every, i=
t's just Tuesday. They built their entire search product, Spiral, this way=
=E2=80=94using a stack of ChatGPT for initial coding, Clerk for authenticat=
ion, Supabase for the database, Railway for hosting, and the Claude API for=
 the AI functionality. Not a prototype=E2=80=94the actual product that cust=
omers pay for.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Claire Vo takes this even further at ChatPRD=
. She assigns Linear tickets directly to Devin, an AI agent that handles en=
tire features autonomously. When I first heard this, I thought she was exag=
gerating. She's not. Devin works through the night, pushing code to staging=
 for her review in the morning. When she finds issues, she doesn't fix them=
 herself. She creates a new ticket explaining the problem and assigns it ba=
ck to Devin or another agent.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Her stack is deliberately div=
erse: Cursor for backend API work and summaries, ChatGPT for quick conversi=
ons (like turning PDFs into .ics calendar files), Lovable for vibe-coding p=
rototypes, and Gemini Flash specifically for video analysis in her podcast =
workflows. She uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to connect these tools=E2=
=80=94her agents can query Segment data directly, bypassing Google Analytic=
s entirely. The SQL queries happen through MCP connections, no dashboard ne=
eded.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">The workflow looks bizarre from the outside. She'll c=
heck what Devin completed overnight, review the staging deploys, create tic=
kets for issues, assign them to various AI agents, then move on to strategi=
c work while the agents handle implementation. It's like managing a team, e=
xcept half the team doesn't need sleep or salary negotiations.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">This extends to how they validate ideas. Vo doesn't spend weeks on an =
MVP. She &quot;vibe-codes&quot; a prototype in Lovable or v0=E2=80=94descri=
bing the general vibe of what she wants and letting the AI figure out the d=
etails. An hour later, she has something real enough to show users. If they=
 hate it, she's lost an hour. If they love it, she can build the real versi=
on, or more likely, just iterate on the prototype until it becomes the real=
 version.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The code quality for a demo like that would horri=
fy traditional engineers. Functions are too long. There's duplicate code ev=
erywhere. Abstractions are minimal. But when you can regenerate an entire c=
omponent in seconds by describing what you want differently, code quality m=
eans something different. It's not about crafting perfect abstractions that=
 will last for years. It's about solving today's problem as quickly as poss=
ible, knowing you can completely rewrite it tomorrow if needed.</p><h2 clas=

: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Now l=
et me tell you about a product director I know at a 400-person B2B SaaS com=
pany. Let's call her Sarah. She's trying to integrate AI into their product=
, and her reality looks nothing like Shipper's or Vo's.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Sar=
ah's first attempt was to get her team access to GitHub Copilot. Three mont=
hs of security reviews. Another month of procurement negotiations. Two mont=
hs of pilot testing with a small group. By the time it rolled out, half the=
 team had already been using ChatGPT on their personal accounts anyway, cop=
ying and pasting code through their browsers, completely defeating the secu=
rity review's purpose.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's the thing: Sarah's not be=
ing unreasonable. Her company handles healthcare data. They have SOX compli=
ance requirements. They have enterprise customers who audit their security =
practices. One data leak through an AI tool, and they lose their biggest co=
ntracts. The stakes are fundamentally different from a startup that can piv=
ot if something goes wrong.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When Sarah's team finally got A=
I tooling approved, it wasn't Devin or Claude Code. It was Azure OpenAI, lo=
cked down with specific data handling agreements, integrated through their =
existing Microsoft infrastructure. The developers can use it, but only thro=
ugh approved interfaces, with all prompts logged for audit purposes. It's A=
I with training wheels, guardrails, and a safety net.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The c=
ultural challenge is even bigger than the technical one. Sarah's senior eng=
ineers have spent decades perfecting their craft. They've built sophisticat=
ed mental models of how software should be architected. Now they're being a=
sked to delegate to an AI that makes mistakes they wouldn't have made as ju=
nior engineers. One senior developer told her, &quot;I didn't spend 20 year=
s learning to code just to become a prompt engineer.&quot;</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
She tried running AI workshops, bringing in consultants, creating innovatio=
n time for experimentation. But the adoption was sporadic. The junior devel=
opers loved it=E2=80=94they were shipping faster than ever. The senior deve=
lopers used it occasionally, usually just for boilerplate code. Middle mana=
gement was terrified it would make their teams redundant.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">T=
he successful adoptions in her company followed a pattern: they happened in=
 pockets where there was already pain. The support team, drowning in ticket=
s, embraced AI categorization and response drafting immediately. The QA tea=
m, perpetually behind, jumped on AI-assisted test generation. The documenta=
tion team, chronically understaffed, became AI power users within weeks. Bu=
t the core product development team? Still debating whether AI-generated co=
de meets their quality standards.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

tack Divergence</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The tool choices between these tw=
o worlds reveal their different priorities. Let me walk through the actual =
stacks I'm seeing, with the specific details that matter.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">S=
tartups are running what I call a &quot;diversified chaos&quot; strategy. T=
hey use routers=E2=80=94OpenRouter or Together AI=E2=80=94to dynamically sw=
itch between models. Claude Opus for deep research and complex reasoning (S=
hipper spawns parallel Claude agents for this), GPT-4 for quick coding task=
s, Gemini Flash for anything multimodal, and open-source models like Llama =
3.2 or Qwen for production where they need to control costs. They're not lo=
yal to any provider; they're loyal to whatever works best for the specific =
task at hand.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The database layer is surprisingly consistent=
: Postgres with pgvector extension for vector embeddings, hosted on either =
Neon or Supabase. Not because it's trendy, but because it's pragmatic. You =
start with one database for everything, add vector search without a migrati=
on, and can scale pretty far before needing to specialize. Redis through Up=
stash handles caching and job queues. Media files go to AWS S3 or Cloudflar=
e R2. As you scale, you might add Pinecone or Weaviate for specialized vect=
or search, but most startups never need to.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The agent orche=
stration layer is where things get interesting. MCP (Model Context Protocol=
) has become the unexpected winner for connecting agents to tools and data.=
 LangChain or Semantic Kernel handle the workflow orchestration and memory =
management. AutoGen comes in when you need true multi-agent collaboration. =
But here's the key: they start simple. Vo began with basic Linear integrati=
ons for Devin, then gradually built up to complex agent handoffs. Shipper s=
tarted with single Claude calls, then evolved to spawning parallel agents w=
ith custom handoff libraries.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For observability, it's LangS=
mith and Helicone from day one. These aren't nice-to-haves; they're essenti=
al. When you're burning $10-15K per month in AI credits, you need to know e=
xactly where every dollar goes. Which prompts are expensive? Which chains a=
re inefficient? Which models are hallucinating? PostHog tracks user analyti=
cs, Sentry catches errors, and Braintrust provides deeper observability for=
 complex chains.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The development stack is Next.js with Type=
Script for full-stack apps, Tailwind with Shadcn components for UI, Prisma =
for database interactions. But the interesting part is how they build: Curs=
or for AI-assisted coding when they need control, Devin for autonomous feat=
ure development when they can specify clearly, Claude Code for complex refa=
ctoring and architectural work. For rapid prototyping, it's Bolt, v0, Lovab=
le, or Replit=E2=80=94whatever gets them from idea to demo fastest.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Infrastructure runs on credits and simplicity. AWS Bedrock when th=
ey have startup credits, Vercel for Next.js hosting, Cloudflare for everyth=
ing edge-related. Railway or Render for backend services. Supabase often ha=
ndles auth, database, and real-time subscriptions in one package. Stripe fo=
r payments, always Stripe. The pattern is clear: minimize the number of ser=
vices you need to understand and maintain.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Mid-market compa=
nies take the opposite approach: single-vendor depth. They pick Azure OpenA=
I or AWS Bedrock and build everything around it. Their database might still=
 be Postgres, but it's probably on Azure Database or AWS RDS with enterpris=
e support contracts. They add specialized vector databases like Pinecone no=
t because they need the performance, but because it came as part of an ente=
rprise AI platform bundle.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The development tools are more c=
onservative: GitHub Copilot for code assistance (after those months of secu=
rity review), existing IDEs with AI plugins rather than new AI-first editor=
s. They might experiment with tools like Cursor in sandboxed environments, =
but production code still goes through traditional development workflows.</=

argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
The daily workflow differences between these environments reveal completely=
 different philosophies of work. In AI-native startups, the boundary betwee=
n thinking and building has essentially dissolved. When Shipper has an idea=
 for a feature, he starts talking to Claude about it. That conversation bec=
omes specification, which becomes code, which becomes the deployed feature=
=E2=80=94all in one continuous flow.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The specific workflow =
at Every looks like this: Shipper opens Claude Code, describes the feature =
he wants in natural language, references existing code patterns in their co=
debase, and lets Claude generate the implementation. He reviews it conversa=
tionally=E2=80=94&quot;that's good but change X to Y&quot;=E2=80=94rather t=
han editing code directly. The feature gets deployed to Railway with a simp=
le command. Total time from idea to production: often under an hour.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">Vo's workflow with Devin is even more radical. She starts her mor=
ning by reviewing Devin's overnight work in Linear. The agent has been assi=
gned tickets with detailed acceptance criteria and context about the codeba=
se. Devin works through them, commits code to feature branches, and updates=
 ticket status with implementation notes. When it gets stuck, it adds comme=
nts explaining what it tried and what's blocking it.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Her pr=
ompt templates for Devin are elaborate and worth understanding. They includ=
e: project context, codebase conventions, common patterns to follow, librar=
ies to prefer, and even tone for code comments. She's essentially training =
Devin to be a team member who understands not just what to build but how to=
 build it in a way that fits with everything else.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But this=
 workflow depends on a tolerance for imperfection that most enterprises can=
't afford. The dashboard that founder built during a user call was function=
al but not production-ready. It handled the happy path perfectly but would =
probably break under edge cases. The database queries weren't optimized. Th=
e error handling was basic. For a startup with 10 customers, that's fine=E2=
=80=94they can fix issues as they arise. For an enterprise with 10,000 cust=
omers, that's a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The enterprise =
workflow remains more structured, and there are good reasons for this. They=
 use AI to accelerate existing processes rather than replace them. A develo=
per might use Copilot to write unit tests faster, but those tests still go =
through code review. A product manager might use ChatGPT to draft requireme=
nts, but they still go through stakeholder review. AI becomes a productivit=
y tool rather than a transformation agent.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Sarah's team fou=
nd a middle ground that's interesting. They created what they call &quot;AI=
 sprints&quot;=E2=80=94one-week periods where they throw normal processes o=
ut the window and build like a startup. No code reviews, no lengthy specifi=
cations, just rapid building with AI assistance. At the end of the week, th=
ey demo everything, pick the best ideas, and then rebuild them properly for=
 production. It gives them startup-style velocity in controlled bursts with=
out sacrificing their production standards.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-p=

20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">At first gl=
ance, that seems insane. You could hire a junior developer for that. But th=
at's the wrong comparison. That $10,000 is giving them the equivalent of 3-=
4 developers working 24/7, never taking breaks, never needing onboarding, n=
ever having bad days. The velocity math works out overwhelmingly in AI's fa=
vor.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">But there's a hidden cost that startups don't talk abo=
ut: the technical debt accumulation is massive. When you can regenerate any=
 component in minutes, you stop thinking about long-term architecture. When=
 AI can refactor anything instantly, you stop worrying about code organizat=
ion. This works until it doesn't. I've seen startups hit a wall where the A=
I can no longer understand their codebase because it's become such a mess o=
f AI-generated spaghetti.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">One founder told me about hitting=
 this wall at around 100,000 lines of code. The AI started making increasin=
gly bizarre suggestions, unable to understand the patterns it had created. =
They had to stop feature development for a month and manually refactor with=
 human developers to create some conceptual clarity. It was like the code h=
ad developed dementia.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Enterprises have the opposite proble=
m. They're so worried about technical debt that they're barely accumulating=
 any code at all. Sarah's team spent six months on an AI implementation tha=
t a startup would have shipped in a week. But their version handles edge ca=
ses, has proper error handling, includes comprehensive tests, and integrate=
s with their existing monitoring. It's bulletproof where the startup versio=
n is held together with hope.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"=

0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The cul=
tural differences run deeper than just risk tolerance. AI-native startups h=
ave developed entirely new cultural norms around creation and ownership. At=
 Every, nobody &quot;owns&quot; code anymore. The code is communal, constan=
tly being rewritten by whoever needs to change it, with AI as the medium of=
 change. There's no ego in implementation because implementation has become=
 commoditized.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This creates interesting dynamics. Shipper t=
old me about a feature that three different people had rewritten completely=
 in the span of a week, each time to add their own functionality. In a trad=
itional environment, this would cause conflicts=E2=80=94people would feel t=
heir work was being disrespected. At Every, it's just iteration. The code i=
s disposable; the functionality is what matters.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The flip s=
ide is that institutional knowledge becomes fragmented. When I asked how th=
ey onboard new developers, Shipper laughed. &quot;We point them to Claude a=
nd tell them to start asking questions.&quot; The AI has become the institu=
tional memory, the documentation, and the onboarding process all in one. It=
 works, but it's fragile. If they ever had to switch AI providers, they'd l=
ose not just a tool but their entire organizational memory.</p><p style=3D"=
margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
>Enterprises can't operate this way, and honestly, they shouldn't try. They=
 have different cultural strengths that AI can amplify rather than replace.=
 Sarah's team has deep domain expertise in healthcare workflows that no AI =
currently understands. They have relationships with customers that span dec=
ades. They have hard-won knowledge about edge cases that only appear at sca=
le.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">The successful enterprise AI adoptions I've seen acknow=
ledge these strengths. They use AI to amplify human expertise rather than r=
eplace it. A senior developer with 20 years of experience becomes even more=
 valuable when they can implement their ideas 10x faster with AI assistance=
. A product manager who deeply understands customer needs becomes more powe=
rful when they can prototype solutions in hours instead of weeks.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">But this requires a different kind of cultural change. It's not abou=
t making everyone an AI user; it's about making AI invisible. The best ente=
rprise implementations I've seen hide the AI entirely. The support team doe=
sn't think they're using AI; they just notice their ticket system got smart=

 16px;">The talent implications of AI-native development are profound and u=
nderdiscussed. Startups are hiring differently now. Vo told me she no longe=
r looks for coding ability in junior hires. She looks for clear thinking an=
d good taste. &quot;I can teach anyone to prompt engineer in a day,&quot; s=
he said. &quot;I can't teach them to know what good looks like.&quot;</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">This is creating a new class of technical workers=E2=80=94people=
 who can build software but can't necessarily code. They understand systems=
, architecture, user experience, but they implement through conversation wi=
th AI rather than through writing code. It's like the difference between an=
 architect and a construction worker, except the AI is doing the constructi=
on instantly.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Traditional engineers often hate this. They s=
ee it as a devaluation of their craft. And they're not wrong=E2=80=94tradit=
ional coding skills are becoming less valuable in purely economic terms. Bu=
t what's becoming more valuable is the ability to think systemically, to un=
derstand complex interactions, to debug at a conceptual level rather than a=
 syntax level. The engineers who thrive in this new world are the ones who =
were always more interested in solving problems than writing code.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">Enterprises face a different talent challenge. They have teams of e=
ngineers with deep technical skills who need to transform into AI orchestra=
tors. It's not just a skill change; it's an identity change. Sarah describe=
d it as &quot;asking Formula 1 drivers to become traffic controllers.&quot;=
 They have the domain knowledge, but the job has fundamentally changed.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">The successful transformations I've seen create hybrid roles. =
Senior engineers become AI architects, designing systems that AI implements=
. Junior developers become AI trainers, creating the examples and patterns =
that AI learns from. Product managers become AI conductors, orchestrating m=
ultiple AI agents to deliver features.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But there's also a t=
alent exodus happening that nobody talks about. The most ambitious engineer=
s are leaving enterprises for AI-native startups, not for better pay, but f=
or the ability to build at AI speed. One engineer told me, &quot;I can buil=
d more in a weekend at a startup than I built in a year at my last company.=
&quot; The velocity is addictive.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

stion</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Let's address the elephant in the room: AI-=
generated code is often terrible. It's verbose, repetitive, and filled with=
 subtle bugs. It confidently implements antipatterns. It occasionally hallu=
cinates entire libraries that don't exist. Anyone who says otherwise is sel=
ling something.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's what I've learned: it doesn't ma=
tter as much as we think it does. The startups shipping AI-generated code a=
ren't succeeding because the code is good. They're succeeding because they =
can iterate so fast that quality becomes an emergent property rather than a=
 designed one.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Vo explained it this way: &quot;We ship brok=
en things quickly, see how they break, then fix them even more quickly. By =
the time a traditional team would have shipped v1, we're on v20.&quot; The =
broken versions that users never see don't matter. The rapid convergence on=
 something that works does.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is antithetical to enterpr=
ise software development, where the first version needs to work reliably fo=
r thousands of users. Sarah's team can't ship something that might break; t=
heir customers depend on their software for critical operations. So they us=
e AI differently=E2=80=94for exploration and prototyping, but not for produ=
ction code without significant human review.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The quality ga=
p is closing though. Each new generation of AI models produces notably bett=
er code. Claude 3.5 writes code that's markedly better than Claude 3. GPT-4=
 understands architectural patterns that GPT-3.5 couldn't grasp. At the cur=
rent rate of improvement, we're probably 18 months from AI-generated code b=
eing indistinguishable from human-written code for most applications.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">But I think focusing on code quality misses the bigger point. Th=
e value isn't in the code; it's in the ability to explore solution spaces r=
apidly. AI allows you to try 20 different approaches in the time it would t=
ake to implement one traditionally. Most will be wrong, but you learn somet=
hing from each failure. The winners aren't the ones who write the best code=
; they're the ones who find the right solution fastest.</p><h2 class=3D"hea=

ep seeing: the hardest part isn't getting AI to work; it's getting it to wo=
rk with everything else. Startups have it easy here=E2=80=94they're buildin=
g greenfield, so they can design their entire system around AI from the sta=
rt. Everything is API-first, documentation-light, AI-friendly.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Enterprises are trying to integrate AI into systems built over decades=
, with complex dependencies, undocumented behaviors, and fragile integratio=
ns. Sarah's team spent three months just figuring out how to get AI-generat=
ed code to work with their legacy authentication system. The AI kept sugges=
ting modern patterns that were incompatible with decisions made in 2008.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">The successful enterprise integrations I've seen take a stran=
gler fig approach=E2=80=94they wrap existing systems with AI-friendly inter=
faces, then gradually replace the internals. One company built what they ca=
lled an &quot;AI translation layer&quot;=E2=80=94a service that converts be=

rks.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
px;font-size: 16px;">The data integration is even messier. Startups design =
their data schemas to be AI-readable from the start. They use clear naming =
conventions, consistent patterns, extensive comments. Enterprises are worki=
ng with databases that have columns named things like &quot;custID_v2_final=
_REAL&quot; because of migrations from 15 years ago. The AI takes one look =
and hallucinates.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The governance challenges are where the startup and enterprise worlds =
diverge most dramatically. Startups have essentially no governance. Vo admi=
tted to me that she has no idea what data has been sent to which AI provide=
rs. &quot;We probably should track that,&quot; she said, &quot;but we're to=
o busy shipping.&quot; This is terrifying from an enterprise perspective bu=
t liberating from a startup perspective.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Enterprises are bu=
ilding elaborate governance frameworks=E2=80=94prompt libraries, approval w=
orkflows, audit trails. Every AI interaction is logged, reviewed, and archi=
ved. They have committees to approve new use cases. They have training prog=
rams on responsible AI use. It's thorough, careful, and incredibly slow.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">But unexpected governance patterns are emerging. Some startup=
s are building in governance from the start, not because they have to, but =
because it makes the AI work better. Shipper showed me their prompt version=
ing system=E2=80=94every prompt is tracked, versioned, and measured for eff=
ectiveness. It started as an optimization tool but became a de facto govern=
ance system.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Meanwhile, some enterprises are creating &quot=
;governance-free zones&quot;=E2=80=94sandbox environments where teams can e=
xperiment without restrictions. Sarah's company has an &quot;AI playground&=
quot; where developers can try anything as long as it doesn't touch product=
ion data. It's become their most valuable learning environment.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The regulatory landscape is forcing everyone to think about governance=
 differently. European companies are already adapting to AI regulations tha=
t American companies are just starting to consider. One founder told me the=
y're building their entire AI system to be &quot;regulation-ready&quot;=E2=
=80=94able to comply with whatever rules emerge. It's constraining in the s=
hort term but might be an advantage long term.</p><h2 class=3D"header-ancho=

at Actually Works</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">After all this analysis, let me=
 tell you what actually works. The successful AI adoptions, whether startup=
 or enterprise, share some common patterns that transcend their differences=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">First, they all start with pain. The teams that successfu=
lly adopt AI are the ones that have a specific, acute problem that AI can s=
olve. Vo started using AI because she was drowning in product requirements.=
 Shipper adopted it because he needed to ship faster than his competition. =
Sarah's successful adoptions happened where teams were overwhelmed. Without=
 real pain, AI becomes a toy rather than a tool.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, th=
ey iterate in public. The successful teams ship their AI experiments where =
users can see them, get feedback, and improve quickly. They don't spend mon=
ths perfecting things in private. Even enterprises are learning to do this=
=E2=80=94Sarah's team now has a &quot;beta&quot; section of their product w=
here AI features appear first, with clear warnings about experimental statu=
s.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Third, they measure differently. Traditional metrics lik=
e code coverage or performance benchmarks matter less than velocity metrics=
. How fast can you go from idea to deployed feature? How quickly can you re=
spond to user feedback? How many experiments can you run per week? The team=
s winning with AI optimize for learning speed over execution quality.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">Fourth, they build AI-first workflows rather than AI-enhanced wo=
rkflows. The difference is subtle but crucial. AI-enhanced means taking you=
r existing process and adding AI to parts of it. AI-first means redesigning=
 your process around AI capabilities. Vo doesn't write specifications that =
AI implements; she has conversations that become specifications and impleme=
ntations simultaneously.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Fifth, they accept imperfection as=
 a feature, not a bug. The successful teams have learned that 80% solutions=
 shipped today beat 100% solutions shipped next quarter. They've internaliz=
ed that perfect is the enemy of good enough, and AI makes good enough achie=
vable in hours instead of weeks.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Looking forward, I see these two worlds=E2=80=
=94startup and enterprise=E2=80=94beginning to learn from each other in int=
eresting ways. Startups are starting to realize they need some governance a=
nd structure as they scale. Enterprises are recognizing that their careful =
approach might be causing them to miss the AI revolution entirely.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">The next generation of tools is being built for this convergence. I=
'm seeing AI platforms that combine startup-style velocity with enterprise-=
grade governance. They let you move fast while maintaining audit trails. Th=
ey enable experimentation while ensuring compliance. They're trying to give=
 you the best of both worlds.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But I think the bigger change=
 is conceptual. We're moving from thinking about AI as a tool to thinking a=
bout it as a medium. Just as the internet wasn't just a faster way to send =
mail but became an entirely new medium for human interaction, AI isn't just=
 a faster way to write code=E2=80=94it's becoming a new medium for creating=
 software.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The companies that understand this shift will th=
rive. They won't just use AI to do their existing work faster; they'll reim=
agine what work means in an AI-saturated environment. They'll build organiz=
ations that are native to this new medium rather than adapted to it.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=

e. But enterprises have their own advantages=E2=80=94resources, customers, =
domain expertise=E2=80=94that could be decisive if they can figure out how =
to leverage them in this new world. The winners won't be the ones who are m=
ost aggressive or most careful with AI. They'll be the ones who best unders=
tand their own constraints and opportunities, and design their AI adoption =
accordingly.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relativ=

 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">Let me end with something personal, because I think it matters. =
I've been building with AI for the past year, and it's changed how I think =
about creation in ways I'm still processing. I used to take pride in crafti=
ng elegant code, in understanding every line of what I built. Now I often d=
on't fully understand the code running in production=E2=80=94I understand w=
hat it does, but not always how.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This was disturbing at fir=
st. It felt like cheating, like I was pretending to be technical while actu=
ally being something else. But I've come to realize that I'm not becoming l=
ess technical; I'm becoming differently technical. I'm operating at a highe=
r level of abstraction, thinking in systems and behaviors rather than synta=
x and functions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The founders I've talked to describe simil=
ar transitions. They're not coding less; they're coding differently. They'r=
e not building less; they're building more. They're not less technical; the=
y're technical in a new way that we don't quite have words for yet.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">This transition is hard, especially for those of us who built our =
identities around traditional technical skills. But it's also liberating. I=
 can build things now that I could only dream about before. I can explore i=
deas that would have taken months to validate. I can create at the speed of=
 thought rather than the speed of typing.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The enterprise fo=
lks going through this transition have it harder in some ways. They have mo=
re to unlearn, more identity to reconstruct. But they also have something v=
aluable=E2=80=94the wisdom to know what actually matters. They understand t=
hat technology is only useful insofar as it serves human needs. They know t=
hat the hardest problems aren't technical but organizational. They have the=
 maturity to adopt AI thoughtfully rather than frantically.</p><h2 class=3D=

r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If there's one thing I=
've learned from comparing these worlds, it's that there's no single right =
way to adopt AI. The startup approach works for startups because they're op=
timizing for learning and velocity in an uncertain environment. The enterpr=
ise approach works for enterprises because they're optimizing for reliabili=
ty and scalability in a complex environment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The mistake is=
 trying to copy the wrong model. I see enterprises trying to move at startu=
p speed and burning out their teams. I see startups trying to implement ent=
erprise governance and grinding to a halt. The successful adoptions happen =
when organizations understand their own context and design their AI strateg=
y accordingly.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But there's also a meta-lesson here about te=
chnological change. We're in a moment where the old rules don't quite apply=
 but the new rules haven't been written. The startups are writing those rul=
es through experimentation. The enterprises are testing which rules can ben=
d and which will break. Both are necessary for us to collectively figure ou=
t how to build in this new world.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The founders I've talked =
to aren't just building products; they're building the patterns that everyo=
ne will use in five years. The enterprise leaders aren't just being careful=
; they're establishing the governance frameworks that will keep AI developm=
ent sustainable. We need both the cowboys and the shepherds, the explorers =
and the settlers.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=
ne-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">What we don't need is more generic advice=
 about AI adoption. We need specific, contextual, honest accounts of what w=
orks and what doesn't, for whom and under what circumstances. We need to st=
op pretending there's a playbook and start admitting we're all figuring thi=
s out as we go.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The AI-native startups have something to te=

 who can learn from both, adapting the lessons to their own context rather =
than blindly copying either model.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
