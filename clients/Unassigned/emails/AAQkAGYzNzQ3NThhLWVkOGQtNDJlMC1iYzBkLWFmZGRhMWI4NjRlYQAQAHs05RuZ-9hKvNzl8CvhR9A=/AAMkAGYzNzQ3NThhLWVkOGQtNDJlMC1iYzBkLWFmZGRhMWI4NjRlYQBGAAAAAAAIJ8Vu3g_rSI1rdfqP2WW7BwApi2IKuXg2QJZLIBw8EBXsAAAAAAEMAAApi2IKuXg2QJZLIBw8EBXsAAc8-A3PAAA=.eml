THERE IS NO WHITE GENOCIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA [3]
BUT ITS INVOCATION BELIES REAL ISSUES PRETORIA HAS TO MANAGE.
BY: RONAN WORDSWORTH
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with U.S. President Donald Trump in May, hoping to reset relations and secure new trade and investment opportunities. Those hopes were quickly dashed as
Trump instead made the meeting about the supposed white genocide happening in South Africa.
To be sure, there is no white genocide happening in South Africa, and the video Trump played at the meeting supposedly showing mass graves of farmers has been thoroughly debunked. But there are other,
real reasons to worry about the U.S.-South African relationship. Ramaphosa’s African National Congress party has a history of balancing relationships among larger powers, but the balance has
faltered, and it seems as though the ANC will be unable to repair its standing with the Trump administration.
[South Africa] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
The meeting between Ramaphosa and Trump was the culmination of a slow and steady deterioration in bilateral ties. South Africa’s implicit support for Russia and its explicit support for Palestine
has upset not just its reputation in the U.S. but also its decadeslong foreign policy of relative neutrality – an approach that has enabled the government to extract good deals, secure concessions
and gain access to more markets than it otherwise would. Access to foreign markets is crucial for a country like South Africa, which is by far the most advanced economy in Africa but which has no
nearby neighbors to buy its goods. Trump’s (false) claims of a genocide against white farmers merely highlight the extent to which relations have soured. (Trump also said the government is
confiscating white land and treating “certain classes” of people badly, both of which are verifiably not happening.)
South Africa’s foreign policy balancing act [6] has given the government a history of established relations with various powers around the world. Broadly speaking, Pretoria has had good relations
with Western countries like the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as Japan, all of which are among its top trade partners. Washington’s Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, for example,
has given its exports preferential market access. Yet it also has close ties with China – its largest trade partner – and Russia. Indeed, its ties to Russia run especially deep: In the Soviet era,
Moscow was a staunch supporter of the ANC in its battle against apartheid. This explains why South Africa has continued to diplomatically support Russia during the Ukraine war despite the fact that it
is only a minor trade partner.
The problem, indirectly articulated by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alvin Botes in a speech at Charles University, my other employer, is that there’s an inherent dilemma in trying to be
friends with everyone. At one point in the speech, Botes compared the war in Ukraine to the Cuban missile crisis, explaining that Russia is simply responding to a threat against its security. But this
is, generously, a specious comparison. The Cuban missile crisis happened because the Soviet Union covertly deployed nuclear weapons within 150 kilometers (93 miles) of the U.S. mainland. The war in
Ukraine happened because Moscow wanted to reclaim its buffer from Europe and NATO. (When questioned about the accuracy of the statement, Botes quickly changed the subject to the war in Gaza.) Faulty
though the comparison may be, it provides insight into the ANC’s outlook: Despite setbacks with Western partners, South Africa is going to stick close to Russia.
The confrontation in the White House was therefore unsurprising. Washington is unhappy with South Africa’s stance on a variety of issues. U.S. lawmakers from both parties and both houses, for
example, have introduced a number of bills since November 2023 proposing a review or removal of South Africa from the AGOA – marking what would be a significant blow to South African exports, nearly
10 percent of which go to the U.S. The calls explicitly cite concerns about South African relations with Russia, Hamas and Iran. The accusations of white genocide – which are the result of lobbying
efforts targeting Elon Musk by an Afrikaner group in Washington – were merely the trigger for the administration to air its grievances.
Washington may have had its fair share of disagreements with South Africa in the past, but relations have worsened markedly in the second Trump administration. Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs
effectively canceled AGOA. Since his inauguration, he has signed an executive order cutting financial assistance to South Africa over its land policy (which made it easier for the state to expropriate
land in the public interest) and its filing of a genocide case at the International Court of Justice against Israel. This is against the backdrop of wider efforts to reduce trade deficits, the
dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the offer of refugee status to white South Africans, and the expulsion of the South African ambassador to Washington. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio has even announced plans to boycott the G20 summit this year because it will be held in Johannesburg.
Ramaphosa went to Washington to try to mend some of the damage to the U.S.-South African relationship. The plan was to lobby the new administration to reinstate aid and financing and to attract
investment in South Africa. To that end, he brought with him a mix of businessmen, ministers and even professional golfer Ernie Els in an apparent attempt to woo Trump.
Ramaphosa was reportedly ready to offer serious concessions to the U.S., including giving it preferential access to critical mineral resources and helium gas deposits and opening up South Africa’s
market to American agricultural companies. At the meeting, he made an offer to buy up to 100 million cubic meters of liquefied natural gas per year from the U.S., worth between $9 billion and $12
billion over the next 10 years. This proposal was part of a larger trade package proposed by Pretoria, which all but accepts that AGOA will not be renewed in September when it expires and, as such, is
looking for ways to safeguard the economy.
The delegation also aimed to win over Musk, who has been highly critical of ANC policies, saying he would not permit the country to use Starlink under the ownership rules set out by the ANC’s Black
Economic Empowerment agenda. Accompanying Ramaphosa was Afrikaner John Steenhuisen, the agriculture minister and head of the opposition Democratic Alliance, which is also a member of the Government of
National Unity. Also present was Johann Rupert, also an Afrikaner and the richest person in South Africa, who shares some U.S. concerns over crime in South Africa but who noted that access to new tech
like Starlink could help empower the poorer and more rural communities where crime is the worst.
While Ramaphosa attempted to negotiate these finer details and validate South Africa’s multilateral approach to foreign policy, Trump came out swinging, espousing fringe conspiracy theories about
white flight and land confiscation, showing videos of mass graves (that turned out to be from an entirely different country) and quoting Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters
party who is given to incendiary, anti-white statements. (The EFF received some 11 percent of the vote but is not part of the unity government.)
Ramaphosa was poised, more or less, pointing out the several rich white South Africans in his entourage and pushing back on the validity of Trump’s claims. Crime, for example, is in fact a major
problem in South Africa, where more than 26,000 murders were committed in 2024. But of those murders, only 44 were linked to farms, and only eight of these victims were white. Needless to say,
Ramaphosa had a hard time putting together a constructive conversation on bilateral trade.
Still, some of the problems the ANC is dealing with are real. The tension with the U.S. is real. Pretoria has upset an otherwise balanced foreign policy by showing too much favor to America’s
enemies in Moscow and Tehran and by criticizing Israel – and it hardly needs to be said that alienating or undermining the U.S. can have negative economic consequences. Also real is the factional
infighting within the ANC between Ramaphosa’s more pragmatic wing and a more ideologically rigid wing. These divisions [7] are partly cause and partly consequence of South Africa’s foreign policy.
Botes' speech, behind its veneer of multilateralism, indicates there are those within the ANC who favor Russia over the West.
South Africa’s white genocide may be a myth, but it belies a deeper problem inside the country – not least of which is its inability to manage its reputation abroad. For Pretoria, there will need
to be a serious, internal reckoning about its geopolitical orientation to avoid being left stranded.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">South African Pres=
ident Cyril Ramaphosa met with U.S. President Donald Trump in May, hoping t=
o reset relations and secure new trade and investment opportunities. Those =
hopes were quickly dashed as Trump instead made the meeting about the suppo=
sed white genocide happening in South Africa.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To be sure, there =
is no white genocide happening in South Africa, and the video Trump played =
at the meeting supposedly showing mass graves of farmers has been thoroughl=
y debunked. But there are other, real reasons to worry about the U.S.-South=
 African relationship. Ramaphosa=E2=80=99s African National Congress party =
has a history of balancing relationships among larger powers, but the balan=
ce has faltered, and it seems as though the ANC will be unable to repair it=
s standing with the Trump administration.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The meeting betwee=
n Ramaphosa and Trump was the culmination of a slow and steady deterioratio=
n in bilateral ties. South Africa=E2=80=99s implicit support for Russia and=
 its explicit support for Palestine has upset not just its reputation in th=
e U.S. but also its decadeslong foreign policy of relative neutrality =E2=
=80=93 an approach that has enabled the government to extract good deals, s=
ecure concessions and gain access to more markets than it otherwise would. =
Access to foreign markets is crucial for a country like South Africa, which=
 is by far the most advanced economy in Africa but which has no nearby neig=
hbors to buy its goods. Trump=E2=80=99s (false) claims of a genocide agains=
t white farmers merely highlight the extent to which relations have soured.=
 (Trump also said the government is confiscating white land and treating =
=E2=80=9Ccertain classes=E2=80=9D of people badly, both of which are verifi=
ably not happening.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><a href=3D"https:/=

YWxhbmNpbmctYWN0Lw" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px=
 0px">South Africa=E2=80=99s foreign policy balancing act</a> has given the=
 government a history of established relations with various powers around t=
he world. Broadly speaking, Pretoria has had good relations with Western co=
untries like the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as Japan, al=
l of which are among its top trade partners. Washington=E2=80=99s Africa Gr=
owth and Opportunity Act, for example, has given its exports preferential m=
arket access. Yet it also has close ties with China =E2=80=93 its largest t=
rade partner =E2=80=93 and Russia. Indeed, its ties to Russia run especiall=
y deep: In the Soviet era, Moscow was a staunch supporter of the ANC in its=
 battle against apartheid. This explains why South Africa has continued to =
diplomatically support Russia during the Ukraine war despite the fact that =
it is only a minor trade partner.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The problem, indir=
ectly articulated by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alvin Botes in a sp=
eech at Charles University, my other employer, is that there=E2=80=99s an i=
nherent dilemma in trying to be friends with everyone. At one point in the =
speech, Botes compared the war in Ukraine to the Cuban missile crisis, expl=
aining that Russia is simply responding to a threat against its security. B=
ut this is, generously, a specious comparison. The Cuban missile crisis hap=
pened because the Soviet Union covertly deployed nuclear weapons within 150=
 kilometers (93 miles) of the U.S. mainland. The war in Ukraine happened be=
cause Moscow wanted to reclaim its buffer from Europe and NATO. (When quest=
ioned about the accuracy of the statement, Botes quickly changed the subjec=
t to the war in Gaza.) Faulty though the comparison may be, it provides ins=
ight into the ANC=E2=80=99s outlook: Despite setbacks with Western partners=
, South Africa is going to stick close to Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The confrontation =
in the White House was therefore unsurprising. Washington is unhappy with S=
outh Africa=E2=80=99s stance on a variety of issues. U.S. lawmakers from bo=
th parties and both houses, for example, have introduced a number of bills =
since November 2023 proposing a review or removal of South Africa from the =
AGOA =E2=80=93 marking what would be a significant blow to South African ex=
ports, nearly 10 percent of which go to the U.S. The calls explicitly cite =
concerns about South African relations with Russia, Hamas and Iran. The acc=
usations of white genocide =E2=80=93 which are the result of lobbying effor=
ts targeting Elon Musk by an Afrikaner group in Washington =E2=80=93 were m=
erely the trigger for the administration to air its grievances.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington may hav=
e had its fair share of disagreements with South Africa in the past, but re=
lations have worsened markedly in the second Trump administration. Trump=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9Cliberation day=E2=80=9D tariffs effectively canceled AGOA.=
 Since his inauguration, he has signed an executive order cutting financial=
 assistance to South Africa over its land policy (which made it easier for =
the state to expropriate land in the public interest) and its filing of a g=
enocide case at the International Court of Justice against Israel. This is =
against the backdrop of wider efforts to reduce trade deficits, the dismant=
ling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the offer of refugee=
 status to white South Africans, and the expulsion of the South African amb=
assador to Washington. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has even announced pl=
ans to boycott the G20 summit this year because it will be held in Johannes=
burg.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ramaphosa went to =
Washington to try to mend some of the damage to the U.S.-South African rela=
tionship. The plan was to lobby the new administration to reinstate aid and=
 financing and to attract investment in South Africa. To that end, he broug=
ht with him a mix of businessmen, ministers and even professional golfer Er=
nie Els in an apparent attempt to woo Trump.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ramaphosa was repo=
rtedly ready to offer serious concessions to the U.S., including giving it =
preferential access to critical mineral resources and helium gas deposits a=
nd opening up South Africa=E2=80=99s market to American agricultural compan=
ies. At the meeting, he made an offer to buy up to 100 million cubic meters=
 of liquefied natural gas per year from the U.S., worth between $9 billion =
and $12 billion over the next 10 years. This proposal was part of a larger =
trade package proposed by Pretoria, which all but accepts that AGOA will no=
t be renewed in September when it expires and, as such, is looking for ways=
 to safeguard the economy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The delegation als=
o aimed to win over Musk, who has been highly critical of ANC policies, say=
ing he would not permit the country to use Starlink under the ownership rul=
es set out by the ANC=E2=80=99s Black Economic Empowerment agenda. Accompan=
ying Ramaphosa was Afrikaner John Steenhuisen, the agriculture minister and=
 head of the opposition Democratic Alliance, which is also a member of the =
Government of National Unity. Also present was Johann Rupert, also an Afrik=
aner and the richest person in South Africa, who shares some U.S. concerns =
over crime in South Africa but who noted that access to new tech like Starl=
ink could help empower the poorer and more rural communities where crime is=
 the worst.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While Ramaphosa at=
tempted to negotiate these finer details and validate South Africa=E2=80=99=
s multilateral approach to foreign policy, Trump came out swinging, espousi=
ng fringe conspiracy theories about white flight and land confiscation, sho=
wing videos of mass graves (that turned out to be from an entirely differen=
t country) and quoting Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fi=
ghters party who is given to incendiary, anti-white statements. (The EFF re=
ceived some 11 percent of the vote but is not part of the unity government.=
)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ramaphosa was pois=
ed, more or less, pointing out the several rich white South Africans in his=
 entourage and pushing back on the validity of Trump=E2=80=99s claims. Crim=
e, for example, is in fact a major problem in South Africa, where more than=
 26,000 murders were committed in 2024. But of those murders, only 44 were =
linked to farms, and only eight of these victims were white. Needless to sa=
y, Ramaphosa had a hard time putting together a constructive conversation o=
n bilateral trade.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Still, some of the=
 problems the ANC is dealing with are real. The tension with the U.S. is re=
al. Pretoria has upset an otherwise balanced foreign policy by showing too =
much favor to America=E2=80=99s enemies in Moscow and Tehran and by critici=
zing Israel =E2=80=93 and it hardly needs to be said that alienating or und=
ermining the U.S. can have negative economic consequences. Also real is the=
 factional infighting within the ANC between Ramaphosa=E2=80=99s more pragm=
atic wing and a more ideologically rigid wing. <a href=3D"https://geopoliti=
calfutures.com/mailster/404352/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9=

Rpb25zLw" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">Thes=
e divisions</a> are partly cause and partly consequence of South Africa=E2=
=80=99s foreign policy. Botes' speech, behind its veneer of multilateralism=
, indicates there are those within the ANC who favor Russia over the West.<=
/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">South Africa=E2=80=
=99s white genocide may be a myth, but it belies a deeper problem inside th=
e country =E2=80=93 not least of which is its inability to manage its reput=
ation abroad. For Pretoria, there will need to be a serious, internal recko=
ning about its geopolitical orientation to avoid being left stranded.</p>
