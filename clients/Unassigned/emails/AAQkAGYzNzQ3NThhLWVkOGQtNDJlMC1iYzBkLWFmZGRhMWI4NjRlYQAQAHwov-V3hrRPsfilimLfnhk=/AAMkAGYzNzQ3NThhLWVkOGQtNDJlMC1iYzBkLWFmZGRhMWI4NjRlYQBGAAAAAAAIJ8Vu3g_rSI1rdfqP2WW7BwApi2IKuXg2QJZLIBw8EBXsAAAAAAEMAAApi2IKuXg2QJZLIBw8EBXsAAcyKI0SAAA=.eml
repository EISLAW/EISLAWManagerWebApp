So I launched PromptKit [ https://substack.com/redirect/db65078a-93d6-4b08-=
93df-04f71b532de2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ] a couple days ago, and I thought it would be a good time to su=
nlight how we build in the age of AI. The concept of PromptKit is pretty si=
mple=E2=80=94prompts aren=E2=80=99t being treated as seriously as code, so =
maybe we should build a tool that takes that seriously.
And yes, there are a number of third party tools out there that I=E2=80=99v=
e looked at that play in the prompt space to some degree, and I think there=
=E2=80=99s a distinct value wedge here (and room for multiple winners, sinc=
e org prompting workflows are highly individual).
This note is focused specifically on voice of customer for PromptKit. It=E2=
=80=99s one of those jobs that would have taken hours or days before and is=
 now possible in just a few minutes with good analysis and an anonymized da=
ta set for an LLM.
One of the ideas that=E2=80=99s been rattling around in my head is that the=
re=E2=80=99s a lot of value in just exposing how intensive AI users use AI =
for real tasks, so that=E2=80=99s some of the concept here. I want you to g=
et an idea for how you could use AI differently by reading this post.
As an aside, it=E2=80=99s somewhat amusing that my entire job earlier in my=
 career is now just done by python tooling in o3 with proper prompting. Wil=
d. Anyway, read on for how we=E2=80=99re thinking of building and a glimpse=
 into how I used o3 to start to get a grip on MVP narrowing for a real AI p=
roduct.
Oh and sweet tidbit=E2=80=94this is not just vaporware. It=E2=80=99s in cod=
e, and so far 60% of code is written by LLM (we=E2=80=99ll see how that hol=
ds up as we near launch). Anyway, to get all the juicy deets read on=E2=80=
=A6
Subscribers get all these posts!
Y=E2=80=99all signed UP lol
Seriously I did not expect to be looking at this many signups already. Whic=
h is great! Shows a bit of validation for the problem space anyway, but it =
definitely generated some downstream challenges around analyzing the data. =
Here=E2=80=99s what happened so far:
During the past two days I=E2=80=99ve reviewed early sign-up comments, trad=
ed notes with an engineer at a large (unnamed) company, had multiple conver=
sations with potential users, and otherwise pressure-tested the rough cut o=
f PromptKit I shared a couple of days ago [ https://open.substack.com/pub/n=
atesnewsletter/p/six-ai-product-principles-no-one?r=3D1z4sm5&utm_campaign=
=3Dpost&utm_medium=3Dweb&showWelcomeOnShare=3Dfalse ].=20
Every conversation circled the same frustrations: prompt text and workflows=
 are scattered across chats and repos; no one can run a quick, trustworthy =
test before hitting =E2=80=9Cdeploy=E2=80=9D; a bad edit can=E2=80=99t be r=
olled back without copy-pasting scraps from browser history; invoices might=
 balloon when giant context windows slip through; and, for anyone in health=
, finance, or client services, legal is asking for a paper trail that doesn=
=E2=80=99t exist.
PromptKit is meant to close that infrastructure gap. You paste a prompt=E2=
=80=94or any text-based snippet=E2=80=94into a browser workspace, upload so=
me sample inputs, click Run Checks, and the system automatically tests the =
change, records an immutable version hash, trims excess context to keep cos=
ts sane, and stores the entire trace locally so nothing leaves your machine=
 unless you choose. In other words, it=E2=80=99s the DevOps safety net that=
 sits between quick experimentation and production traffic=E2=80=94without =
locking you to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any single model vendor. Because we li=
ve in a multi-model world! And it packages all of that into a workspace whe=
re you can have prompt folders, etc. to keep things organized.
The sections that follow lay out what we learned from users in detail, how =
those lessons map one-to-one to the five features shipping in the MVP, and =
why discovery moves differently when large-language models let you prototyp=
e ideas in hours instead of weeks.
What we learned from the first 158 voices
We had a lot more signups than commenters (as usual) but 158 of you spoke u=
p! Which is great.
The most striking discovery was how quickly early enthusiasm for =E2=80=9CA=
I magic=E2=80=9D turns into operational anxiety once teams move beyond tink=
ering. Nearly every respondent had a version of the same story: the first d=
emo lands, stakeholders cheer, and then the seams start to show.
The first seam is sprawl. Prompts, helper snippets, and even entire workflo=
w files end up buried in Slack channels, Replit projects, or half-remembere=
d Google Docs. One consultant described spending an afternoon hunting for =
=E2=80=9Csummary-FINAL-reallyFINAL_v4.txt=E2=80=9D while a client waited on=
 Zoom. That kind of scavenger hunt isn=E2=80=99t just annoying; it slows it=
eration to a crawl because no one is sure which version is safe to modify.
Next comes the evaluation void. Builders told us, almost verbatim, =E2=80=
=9CEvals are impossible right now.=E2=80=9D They can eyeball a handful of o=
utputs, but the moment they need to prove=E2=80=94objectively=E2=80=94that =
version two of a prompt is better (or at least not worse) than version one,=
 they hit a wall. Without that evidence, every change feels like a gamble, =
which leads directly to the third pain: rollback dread. One bad deploy can =
flood a help desk with hallucinated answers or botched summaries, yet resto=
ring the last good state usually means frantic copy-pasting from browser hi=
story.
Overlaying these workflow pains are two hard constraints. First, model neut=
rality: nobody wants to stake their roadmap on a single provider when new m=
odels appear monthly and pricing shifts weekly. Second, cost discipline: on=
ce prompts start hauling entire knowledge bases into the context window, to=
ken invoices double overnight. Finance teams notice, and the experimentatio=
n budget freezes.
Finally, consultants, healthcare startups, and legal teams surfaced a compl=
iance layer we hadn=E2=80=99t fully appreciated: they need an audit trail=
=E2=80=94a clear, queryable record of who changed what prompt, when, with w=
hat result. Without that, every client deliverable or regulatory review bec=
omes a scramble to piece together evidence after the fact.
Taken together, these interviews paint a clear picture: the community doesn=
=E2=80=99t need another prompt playground. They need a light but reliable l=
ayer of DevOps=E2=80=94versioning, testing, rollback, cost control, and log=
ging=E2=80=94built specifically for language-model workflows. The next sect=
ion shows the actual breakout out of o3 across all this customer voice.
What the wait-list tells us
Here we go=E2=80=94analysis of 158 substantive responses. I worked with o3 =
to tag each line against ten recurring themes (a comment could hit more tha=

Sidebar: if you=E2=80=99re wondering how I got o3 to do this, the key is an=
 anonymized CSV, and being extremely specific with my expected output forma=
t and expectation to read the ENTIRE spreadsheet. o3 (like a lot of other L=
LMs) has a tendency to undercut long lists, so I had to be clear about my e=
xpectations for a full trued-up count. Once I got that across in the prompt=
 it was relatively easy to close out.
Here=E2=80=99s what shook out:
(46 additional comments were too vague to classify.)
What stands out
Workspace pain is the loudest signal. =E2=80=9CFolders,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cc=
atalogs,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cimport,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cdrag-and-drop=E2=
=80=9D requests top the list. People need a single place to park prompts an=
d workflow JSON before they even worry about testing or sharing.
CI/testing frustration is real. Twenty-two comments still plead for an easy=
 =E2=80=9CDid this break?=E2=80=9D harness. Evaluation remains the blocker =
to confident deploys.
IDE integration demand is stronger than expected. A lot of builders want Pr=
omptKit to show up inside VS Code, not just the browser.
Token-cost is low-ish. Only one explicit mention. The router=E2=80=99s effi=
ciency gains still matter, but we might downshift our messaging here.
How this affects v1
We already folded Import & multi-artifact support into the Workspace after =
a couple of initial conversations; the new numbers confirm that move. The r=
est of the MVP stays as planned:
Workspace for single-source-of-truth.
CI Runner + guardrails for the eval gap.
Version Store & rollback for safety.
Context Router =CE=B1 for smart context (efficiency messaging toned down).
Runtime Log for traceability.
IDE plug-ins and team sharing move up the post-MVP roadmap, but nothing new=
 forces a scope change. The data says we=E2=80=99re pointed more or less th=
e right direction with the thesis, and now we have to go out and deliver.
How feedback translates into the MVP we=E2=80=99re shipping
Every feature in PromptKit=E2=80=99s first release traces straight back to =
the user pains you just saw tallied. The product is deliberately small=E2=
=80=94five pieces that work together rather than a buffet of half-done tool=
s. This is the concept we=E2=80=99re working from (a few details may shift =
here and there as we get into alpha).
Workspace
The most common frustration was losing track of =E2=80=9Cwhich prompt is li=
ve.=E2=80=9D The Workspace is a simple file tree in the browser. You can dr=
ag in a prompt, a chunk of JSON from a workflow builder, or a Markdown note=
 and tag it Draft or Ready. That alone eliminates the scavenger hunt across=
 Slack threads and Google Docs. Import is frictionless=E2=80=94paste or dra=
g a file and it lands exactly where it belongs.
CI Runner with Guardrails
Twenty-plus respondents asked for an easy way to know whether v2 is safer t=
han v1. The Runner is that test harness. Click Run Checks and PromptKit fir=
es a small set of examples at your artifact, then applies guardrails for PH=
I/PII, jailbreak strings, and length limits. If it passes, you see a green =
bar; if not, the failing text is highlighted. No coding required.
Version Store & One-Click Rollback
Rollback dread ranked third in the feedback. Every green build is stamped w=
ith an immutable hash and added to history. If a new prompt pushes garbage =
to customers, one click moves the pointer back to the last good hash. No co=
py-paste, no guesswork.
Context Router =CE=B1
While only a few users mentioned cost directly, many asked for smarter cont=
ext routing and agent-style tool calling. The Router trims unused chunks be=
fore they ever reach the model, which keeps latency predictable and invoice=
s from spiraling. =E2=80=9CSmart context=E2=80=9D is the headline benefit; =
lower token spend is the side effect.
Runtime Log
Consultants and regulated teams need an audit trail. PromptKit writes a loc=
al log of every run=E2=80=94input, output, guardrail status, and token coun=
t=E2=80=94for fourteen days. That satisfies client reviews and becomes raw =
material for new test cases.
These five components cover the top pains without wandering into territory =
that belongs in a later release (full RBAC, graphical workflow builders, or=
 a public prompt marketplace). The result should feel less like yet another=
 =E2=80=9Cprompt playground=E2=80=9D and more like the safety net you wish =
you=E2=80=99d had the first time a small edit took a production system offl=
ine.
How it works in practice
Work with PromptKit starts in the Workspace. You paste or drag a prompt fil=
e into a folder, tag it Draft or Ready, and it sits alongside every other p=
rompt you care about=E2=80=94no more digging through Slack threads or Notio=
n pages to find =E2=80=9Cthe live version.=E2=80=9D From there you press Ru=
n Checks. The CI Runner with its built-in guardrails pushes stored example =
inputs through the prompt and scans the output for PII/PHI, jailbreak patte=
rns, and length violations. A single green bar means the change is good; a =
red bar lists the exact lines that failed so you can fix them before anyone=
 outside your browser sees the mistake.
When a prompt passes, PromptKit stamps it with a SHA hash and records it in=
 the Version Store. Clicking Promote flips production to that hash; if the =
new version misbehaves, Rollback instantly re-points the prod pointer to th=
e previous green hash=E2=80=94no copy-paste heroics, no late-night guesswor=
k. With the prompt live, every call flows through the Context Router =CE=B1=
=2E The router=E2=80=99s only job at this=20=
stage is to strip out unused contex=
t before the request reaches the model, keeping latency steady and token co=
sts predictable without introducing any agent logic or orchestration comple=
xity.
Each production run writes a short line to the Runtime Log: the redacted in=
put sample, the output text, guardrail pass/fail status, and the token coun=
t after routing. Logs stay local for fourteen days and export to CSV if you=
 need them for a client review or a compliance check. That closed loop=E2=
=80=94organise, test, promote, trim, and observe=E2=80=94covers every pain =
users raised in the first round of research without straying beyond the exa=
ct scope of the MVP.
What building with LLMs does to product discovery
The past two days of research underscored a new rhythm: speed is no longer =
the bottleneck, focus is. With ChatGPT and its siblings, I can turn a sketc=
h into a working prototype during the same Zoom call in which the idea emer=
ges. That immediacy is exhilarating, but it also tempts you to pile on feat=
ures faster than you can validate them.
The antidote is discipline. Instead of month-long survey cycles, every conv=
ersation, email thread, and wait-list comment became a mini-dataset. Quick =
tagging and counts replaced guesswork about which problems were =E2=80=9Cbi=
g.=E2=80=9D When those counts said artifact sprawl and evaluation gaps sat =
at the top, I resisted the lure of shiny agent designers or team collaborat=
ion. The data didn=E2=80=99t support it.
Speed also flips the usual order of operations. Before LLMs, you proved des=
irability first because feasibility took months. Now feasibility is a given=
=E2=80=94you can glue a prompt to an API in an afternoon=E2=80=94so reliabi=
lity becomes the real test. Users asked =E2=80=9CDoes it break? Can I undo =
it?=E2=80=9D long before they cared about dashboards or aesthetics. That=E2=
=80=99s why PromptKit ships with a test harness and rollback button before =
it ships a visual workflow builder.
Rapid prototyping forces a stricter definition of =E2=80=9Cdone.=E2=80=9D E=
ach MVP feature had to neutralize a ranked pain with no extra surface area.=
 If a widget didn=E2=80=99t kill a top-three frustration, then really why k=
eep it? The discovery loop shrank to hours: gather feedback, prototype inst=
antly, re-validate, and keep only the pieces that solve the loudest problem=
s. It=E2=80=99s a pace that feels more like a relay sprint than a marathon=
=E2=80=94and right now, that=E2=80=99s where the best signal lives.
What=E2=80=99s next
We=E2=80=99re working on the alpha now; the moment it=E2=80=99s stable we=
=E2=80=99ll invite the next wave of testers. If the pains outlined here sou=

ace. Your feedback will land directly and I promise we=E2=80=99ll look at i=
