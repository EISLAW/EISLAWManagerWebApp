REPORT FROM SERBIA [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
I first visited Serbia in the early 1970s. At the time, I was genuinely unaware that I was in Serbia. I thought I was visiting Yugoslavia, and though I realized it had many provinces, I didn’t grasp
that they were, in fact, different nations with their own languages and cultures. The only thing they seemed to share was distrust in one another.
[4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
What I saw in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, was an Eastern European city, old and still scarred by World War II. I traveled there because I was writing my doctoral dissertation on the
intellectual foundation of the New Left. Yugoslavia fascinated me because though it was communist, it was not a Soviet satellite – indeed, it was frequently hostile to the Soviets. Josip Broz Tito,
an extraordinary leader of the anti-German resistance and later the leader of Yugoslavia, appeared on the surface to be a New Leftist. But that was an illusion.
I was drawn back in later years to thinking about Yugoslavia, wondering how Tito held the place together and writing (from a distance) about NATO and the U.S. intervention in the Balkans – an act I
regarded then (and now) as insane. So insane that it caused me to question then-President Bill Clinton’s grip on reality.
I have been to Serbia several times, before and after the bombing, but my current visit has been the most startling. The rancor toward the U.S. has subsided. Everyone speaks English, which is taught
as early as the first grade, and Belgrade has become a world-class city.
I was invited by the Pupin Initiative, an independent organization founded to bolster U.S.-Serbia ties through collaborative efforts and policies. Its founder and executive director, Vuk Velebit,
arranged two full days of meetings for my wife, Meredith, and me. Over the course of those two days, I met with the country’s foreign minister, the U.S. charge d’affaires and many others. My most
striking meetings were with groups of young people, who were far more interested in their work and computer screens than in me. U.S. companies like Microsoft have entered Serbia – less, I think, for
marketing purposes than to take advantage of a highly educated and technically capable generation of Serbians working on creating the future of technology on multiple levels. Frankly, it reminded me
of my home in Austin, Texas. I should note that the employees of one company I visited were trying to create platforms for interactive maps that can integrate multiple dimensions of geography. Since
geopolitics lives on maps, I was fascinated by the possibilities.
I left Serbia this time having learned three truths. First, though Serbia is Serbia, and though it is still located in the Balkans, it is not a slave to nationalism. Second, the intellectual power of
Eastern Europe still exists, it is highly concentrated in Belgrade, and  U.S. tech companies, having realized as much, are moving in. And third, despite all that has happened in the Balkans, I feel
more at home in Belgrade than in most other cities I visit. Strangely enough, the technical and entrepreneurial spirit is more American there than anywhere else I’ve been in Europe.
It is different in another way. In Europe, memories are measured in centuries, and most memories are bad – even terrible. Those memories continue to haunt its people so much that they can define
countries. The same bad memories are present in Serbia, but as with the U.S., where people remember but are able to a great extent to move on, Serbians are capable of looking forward instead of
backward.
When I speak of the intellectual power of Eastern Europe, I do so not without empirical evidence. For better or worse, the atomic weapons were developed with the help of several Hungarian scientists.
Nikola Tesla, the Serbian father of electricity, at least as great as Thomas Edison, was from here. When I visited Serbian tech companies, I kept thinking of Tesla and his personal relationship with
Edison, with whom he collaborated, and with whom he split. I don’t know how much ego played a part in their divorce. But the American ego is not lacking in Belgrade. I value ego, as an engine of
creativity, and it is here in Belgrade.
In Serbia, as in all places, it is essential to understand geopolitical realities. Tito was a communist who would not subordinate Yugoslavia’s national interests to Moscow. Serbia has had a recent
influx of Russians and Ukrainians fleeing war and seeking better lives. The country has close ties with Russia, yet last week, Russia accused Serbia of selling ammunition to Ukraine. (Belgrade said it
sold the ammunition to someone else, who in turn, and without its knowledge, sold it to Ukraine.) The bottom line is that Serbia is following its own course, much as it did during the Cold War. It is
keeping its distance from Russia and reaching out to others, and though this frustrates Russia, it does not frustrate it so much to invite Russian reprisal. (Not that it’s even clear that Russia
could respond if it wanted to.) It is equally noteworthy that English is the chosen second language of much of Europe, including Serbia, and that is perhaps more important than membership in NATO or
the EU or any of the other legacy institutions of the Cold War. To me, it seems important that Serbia focus on being the southernmost nation of Eastern Europe, looking northward rather than being
preoccupied with events to its south. Its future is bright, but the sun is rising in the north.
Geopolitics is the true dismal science. The history of the Balkans includes the Turkish conquest, communism and ruthless neutrality. The people of the Balkans understand geopolitical reality, I think
from birth. They understand power and its limits, and they sense the power of the U.S. not from its ability to bomb them but from the ability of its technology to empower them. This may not be true of
all the Balkan countries, but it is true of Serbia.
Serbia has cast its lot in one direction, not with America but with its own value to U.S. businesses – and thus what those businesses can bring to Serbia. Unlike Romania [6], which is deeply
concerned by Russian power, Serbia has handled Russia more deftly. Russia is still a great power, in terms of size and potential, but Serbia is confident that with history and the lessons taught by
Tito, it can continue to manage their bilateral relationship. What Serbia needs now is a strong relationship with the U.S., one based not on military alliance but on mutual commercial opportunity. In
my view, there are times when U.S. businesses understand the world better than the State Department does. It is clear that the tech industry understands Serbia's potential, and I suspect the State
Department is not far behind.
I am not by nature optimistic, and in my profession, optimism is prohibited. But I must say that what I have seen in Serbia justifies optimism. The first time I traveled here, I was searching for
meaning in the New Left, only to find that there was none. Then I came looking for vestiges of the Cold War, only to discover that the questions I had were as irrelevant as those of my first visit.
Here, geopolitics is not as dismal as elsewhere.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">What I saw in Belg=
rade, the capital of Yugoslavia, was an Eastern European city, old and stil=
l scarred by World War II. I traveled there because I was writing my doctor=
al dissertation on the intellectual foundation of the New Left. Yugoslavia =
fascinated me because though it was communist, it was not a Soviet satellit=
e =E2=80=93 indeed, it was frequently hostile to the Soviets. Josip Broz Ti=
to, an extraordinary leader of the anti-German resistance and later the lea=
der of Yugoslavia, appeared on the surface to be a New Leftist. But that wa=
s an illusion.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I was drawn back i=
n later years to thinking about Yugoslavia, wondering how Tito held the pla=
ce together and writing (from a distance) about NATO and the U.S. intervent=
ion in the Balkans =E2=80=93 an act I regarded then (and now) as insane. So=
 insane that it caused me to question then-President Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s=
 grip on reality.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I have been to Ser=
bia several times, before and after the bombing, but my current visit has b=
een the most startling. The rancor toward the U.S. has subsided. Everyone s=
peaks English, which is taught as early as the first grade, and Belgrade ha=
s become a world-class city.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I was invited by t=
he Pupin Initiative, an independent organization founded to bolster U.S.-Se=
rbia ties through collaborative efforts and policies. Its founder and execu=
tive director, Vuk Velebit, arranged two full days of meetings for my wife,=
 Meredith, and me. Over the course of those two days, I met with the countr=
y=E2=80=99s foreign minister, the U.S. charge d=E2=80=99affaires and many o=
thers. My most striking meetings were with groups of young people, who were=
 far more interested in their work and computer screens than in me. U.S. co=
mpanies like Microsoft have entered Serbia =E2=80=93 less, I think, for mar=
keting purposes than to take advantage of a highly educated and technically=
 capable generation of Serbians working on creating the future of technolog=
y on multiple levels. Frankly, it reminded me of my home in Austin, Texas. =
I should note that the employees of one company I visited were trying to cr=
eate platforms for interactive maps that can integrate multiple dimensions =
of geography. Since geopolitics lives on maps, I was fascinated by the poss=
ibilities.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I left Serbia this=
 time having learned three truths. First, though Serbia is Serbia, and thou=
gh it is still located in the Balkans, it is not a slave to nationalism. Se=
cond, the intellectual power of Eastern Europe still exists, it is highly c=
oncentrated in Belgrade, and&nbsp; U.S. tech companies, having realized as =
much, are moving in. And third, despite all that has happened in the Balkan=
s, I feel more at home in Belgrade than in most other cities I visit. Stran=
gely enough, the technical and entrepreneurial spirit is more American ther=
e than anywhere else I=E2=80=99ve been in Europe.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It is different in=
 another way. In Europe, memories are measured in centuries, and most memor=
ies are bad =E2=80=93 even terrible. Those memories continue to haunt its p=
eople so much that they can define countries. The same bad memories are pre=
sent in Serbia, but as with the U.S., where people remember but are able to=
 a great extent to move on, Serbians are capable of looking forward instead=
 of backward.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">When I speak of th=
e intellectual power of Eastern Europe, I do so not without empirical evide=
nce. For better or worse, the atomic weapons were developed with the help o=
f several Hungarian scientists. Nikola Tesla, the Serbian father of electri=
city, at least as great as Thomas Edison, was from here. When I visited Ser=
bian tech companies, I kept thinking of Tesla and his personal relationship=
 with Edison, with whom he collaborated, and with whom he split. I don=E2=
=80=99t know how much ego played a part in their divorce. But the American =
ego is not lacking in Belgrade. I value ego, as an engine of creativity, an=
d it is here in Belgrade.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Serbia, as in a=
ll places, it is essential to understand geopolitical realities. Tito was a=
 communist who would not subordinate Yugoslavia=E2=80=99s national interest=
s to Moscow. Serbia has had a recent influx of Russians and Ukrainians flee=
ing war and seeking better lives. The country has close ties with Russia, y=
et last week, Russia accused Serbia of selling ammunition to Ukraine. (Belg=
rade said it sold the ammunition to someone else, who in turn, and without =
its knowledge, sold it to Ukraine.) The bottom line is that Serbia is follo=
wing its own course, much as it did during the Cold War. It is keeping its =
distance from Russia and reaching out to others, and though this frustrates=
 Russia, it does not frustrate it so much to invite Russian reprisal. (Not =
that it=E2=80=99s even clear that Russia could respond if it wanted to.) It=
 is equally noteworthy that English is the chosen second language of much o=
f Europe, including Serbia, and that is perhaps more important than members=
hip in NATO or the EU or any of the other legacy institutions of the Cold W=
ar. To me, it seems important that Serbia focus on being the southernmost n=
ation of Eastern Europe, looking northward rather than being preoccupied wi=
th events to its south. Its future is bright, but the sun is rising in the =
north.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Geopolitics is the=
 true dismal science. The history of the Balkans includes the Turkish conqu=
est, communism and ruthless neutrality. The people of the Balkans understan=
d geopolitical reality, I think from birth. They understand power and its l=
imits, and they sense the power of the U.S. not from its ability to bomb th=
em but from the ability of its technology to empower them. This may not be =
true of all the Balkan countries, but it is true of Serbia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Serbia has cast it=
s lot in one direction, not with America but with its own value to U.S. bus=
inesses =E2=80=93 and thus what those businesses can bring to Serbia. Unlik=
e <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/404652/5e27030c0318f0=
96cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW9wb2xpdGljYWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9yZXBvcnQtZnJv=
bS1idWNoYXJlc3Qv" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0=
px">Romania</a>, which is deeply concerned by Russian power, Serbia has han=
dled Russia more deftly. Russia is still a great power, in terms of size an=
d potential, but Serbia is confident that with history and the lessons taug=
ht by Tito, it can continue to manage their bilateral relationship. What Se=
rbia needs now is a strong relationship with the U.S., one based not on mil=
itary alliance but on mutual commercial opportunity. In my view, there are =
times when U.S. businesses understand the world better than the State Depar=
tment does. It is clear that the tech industry understands Serbia's potenti=
al, and I suspect the State Department is not far behind.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I am not by nature=
 optimistic, and in my profession, optimism is prohibited. But I must say t=
hat what I have seen in Serbia justifies optimism. The first time I travele=
d here, I was searching for meaning in the New Left, only to find that ther=
e was none. Then I came looking for vestiges of the Cold War, only to disco=
ver that the questions I had were as irrelevant as those of my first visit.=
 Here, geopolitics is not as dismal as elsewhere.</p>
