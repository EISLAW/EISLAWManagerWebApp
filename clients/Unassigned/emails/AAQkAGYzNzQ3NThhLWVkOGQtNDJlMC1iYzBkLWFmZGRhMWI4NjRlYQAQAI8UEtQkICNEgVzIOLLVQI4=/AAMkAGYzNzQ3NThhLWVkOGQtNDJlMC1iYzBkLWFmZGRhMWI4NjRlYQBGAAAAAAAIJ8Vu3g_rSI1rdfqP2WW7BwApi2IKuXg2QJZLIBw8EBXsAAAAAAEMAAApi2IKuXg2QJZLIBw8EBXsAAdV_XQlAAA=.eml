I wanted to take a bit of a different tack with this one. Shorter. More of =
a story we can all share and talk about.=20
This one just felt like it needed to be free as the birds and open as the s=
ky.
Hope you enjoy!=20
Subscribers get all these pieces!
I think we'll call him Josh. Josh isn't real. Josh is an amalgamation of a =
lot of different stories that I've been privileged to be a part of over the=
 last year or two, often in a small way, often overheard in a cocktail loun=
ge or through a conversation with a colleague or in a few cases, one-on-one=
 talking about work and life. Sometimes at a conference, sometimes at home,=
 sometimes on the phone, sometimes out in the world walking around where pe=
ople talk about AI.
Josh's story is about AI. So many of our stories are about AI right now. An=
d the reason I'm sharing this story is because I don't think Josh's story g=
ets shared enough.
Meet Josh
Josh is a guy who got a good college education=E2=80=94he got a journalism =
degree. He has a little bit of college debt left, not a lot. And he had hop=
ed, as many hope who get into journalism and liberal arts, to make a career=
 for himself from a media perspective. He'd hoped to be a celebrated column=
ist one day.
He got his start at a very small internet newsroom that got shut down very =
quickly when AI came along. And Josh will tell you: "AI took my job." Full =
stop.
Josh never really got the chance for his career to upshift because he gradu=
ated in 2018. He didn't have more than a couple of years of experience in t=
he newsroom. And then COVID hit and things shifted. And then after COVID hi=
t, AI hit and Josh feels like he's been taking it on the chin for a long, l=
ong time.
When Josh hears advice like, "hey, you should vibe code," he just kind of r=
olls his eyes. That's not what he set out to do. That's not what he's passi=
onate about. He got into journalism to tell stories. He wants to tell peopl=
e's stories.
Josh=E2=80=99s Dreams on Ice
Josh has a small, fragile dream. He wants to tell the stories of how people=
's lives are changing in tangible ways because of AI. But Josh is at a loca=
l minima, which is a fancy way of saying he is stuck. Josh can't get the eq=
uipment that he needs for the podcast studio of his dreams, and (much more =
important) Josh can't get the contacts that he needs to set up the conversa=
tions he=E2=80=99d like to have. That=E2=80=99s the expensive part (but not=
 in money)=E2=80=94Josh is out of the network he needs to be in to have the=
 conversations he=E2=80=99d need to have to get his dream on track.
The dream feels like it=E2=80=99s dying before it gets off the ground, and =
Josh is struggling to care because he has to make his college debt payment =
and since when did an ordinary guy=E2=80=99s podcast pay enough for that? T=
he dream he has just doesn=E2=80=99t feel viable anymore.=20
Josh has moved back home with his parents to Vermont. He's settled in and h=
e's not sure where his career is going at this point. And all the AI course=
work that he can find=E2=80=94and he does a little bit of learning online=
=E2=80=94isn't really helping him move forward.
Josh doesn't see AI as an enabler. Far from it. Josh rolls his eyes when pe=
ople talk about AI helping. All Josh sees is obstacles created by AI, frank=
ly. AI is the one that took Josh's job away. AI is the one that killed Josh=
=E2=80=99s career. And Josh isn=E2=80=99t shy about saying so.
Why Josh's Story Matters
I share Josh's story because as much as I like to talk a lot about the pote=
ntial that we all have to unleash with AI, I don't want to miss out on the =
difficult stories. I don't want to miss out on the challenging stories, the=
 stories that don't fit as easily into that narrative of progress. And the =
reality is, with any story of technical change, there are stories like Josh=
's.
Sidebar: One of the things that isn=E2=80=99t helpful is connecting the dot=
s at this point. I could spend a few hundred words painting the story of th=
e changing macro-economics of media over the last decade prior to AI and th=
en eventually tie that larger industrial change in how we tell stories to J=
osh=E2=80=99s experience=E2=80=94but Josh doesn=E2=80=99t want to hear that=
=2E
In 2025, a lot of the responsibility that we carry as a society is to think=
 about how we can support the Joshes of this world. Not support them in the=
 sense of giving them a handout=E2=80=94I don't think Josh is interested in=
 that either. I'm talking about helping Josh find a place where he knows th=
at he's valued for the contributions he can bring, the passion he has for t=
elling stories in this world.
This is where it would be nice to have a silver bullet. I have a lot of bro=
nze bullets=E2=80=94tactical helps that I can pull out and try. But there a=
re no universal answers. And I find reaching for tactical tips is often the=
 last thing the Joshes I speak to want.=20
When you=E2=80=99re feeling lost because of AI, just listening is the first=
 job.
What Do We Say to Josh?
Now, to be honest Josh is sometimes not an easy person to help. Josh doesn'=
t want a handout. Josh is suspicious if you try to give him advice. Josh re=
sents AI to the point where if you recommend a practical solution to him th=
at might help, he's gonna say no. From his point of view, he=E2=80=99s corr=
ect.
And that makes it difficult, because even options that are positive and hel=
pful for Josh can be perceived as threatening.=20
I want to suggest that the only way to get past that, to get to the tactica=
l help you might have in mind, is to start with an honest question:
Are you open to having an honest conversation about the idea that the game =
board has changed, you're right about that.=20
The rules of the game have changed a bit, you're right about that.=20
But there still may be a space for you and your talents and your passion th=
at you bring, even if it's not what you originally imagined. Are you open t=
o your dreams shifting?
That's the thing at the root that I think we need to talk about. And that's=
 not really an AI conversation. And I share that because that feels like th=
at's a conversation many of us who are interested in AI, who are passionate=
 about AI, need to be having with those around us.
I see the poll results. I see that AI is not trusted [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/0309cf05-be25-49c3-9731-ecb63c426e4c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. There are a lot of Joshes in thi=
s world. It makes sense that they may not trust AI. I don't blame them. It'=
s kind of rational. But in that world, we have to be the ones=E2=80=94we wh=
o are interested in AI have to be the ones who are able to sit down and inv=
ite a conversation about how all of our dreams are changing because of AI.
That's not something that anybody is immune to, including me!
My Own Story of Change
And so besides telling Josh's story, I'll tell my own story a little bit. I=
 got my start in a job that AI has changed dramatically. I was doing nonpro=
fit grant management. AI can do a lot of the work that I was doing at the p=
ush of a button.
Then I went over to Oracle iStore management and conversion optimization. C=
onversion optimization doesn't exist as a job anymore, really. Not even on =
LinkedIn. AI took it away. And iStore=E2=80=94I mean, who has Oracle iStore=
 anymore? I'm sure someone's gonna comment, "I have Oracle iStore" after I =
publish this, but it=E2=80=99s not much of a job anymore.
And then after that I went and did marketing and I looked at marketing attr=
ibution systems. Again, another area where AI has taken a lot of the work a=
way. I looked at voice of customer at Amazon=E2=80=94almost totally automat=
ed by AI now.
You get the idea.=20
And what's funny as I look at that list is that even though AI has made hug=
e strides, we still have people who handle grants, although now it=E2=80=99=
s often wrapped into a fundraising title. We still have people who are work=
ing in web production and how to make excellent experiences on the web, whi=
ch is basically what conversion optimization does. We still have people who=
 are focused on e-commerce management online, which is what I was doing wit=
h iStore. We still have people who are focused on learning from the voice o=
f the customer, which would be what I was doing when I was later in my care=
er at Amazon. We still have people who are focused on marketing and underst=
anding marketing data.
Those functions still have humans doing important work in those areas, but =
many of the individual day-to-day skills ended up getting peeled away. And =
that's one of the really interesting things about the nature of work that I=
 think we need to talk about more honestly with ourselves, with those aroun=
d us, and with the Joshes in our lives.
The Flexibility to Dream Differently
If I had stuck with any individual dream, if I had told myself, "I'm gonna =
be a marketer and I'm just gonna do marketing," or "I'm going to be in conv=
ersion optimization and get really good at that," or more recently, "I'm go=
nna be in product management and get really good at that," I would have giv=
en myself a constraint on my dreams that I did not need to have.=20
I would have set myself up with artificial constraints. I would have put my=
self in a box.
Instead, I've been focused on this:=20
What are problems that I can run after solving as hard as I can?=20
How can I figure out how to add value against those problem spaces even if =
it feels scrappy today, even if it feels kludgy, even if it feels awkward, =
even if it feels like I'm not doing a great job because I'm new at approach=
ing the problem in this new way?
Where do my dreams need to be held lightly because my world is changing rea=
lly fast?
Here=E2=80=99s one that=E2=80=99s changed for me: I=E2=80=99m probably neve=
r going to be a CPO now. That job role is starting to become an endangered =
species as product teams evolve rapidly.
And that=E2=80=99s after investing a lot in the product career ladder, afte=
r feeling the pain of starting rough in the job family. When I was first ge=
tting into product management, I felt really awkward. My PRD instincts were=
n=E2=80=99t there. My voice of customer instincts were off. I didn=E2=80=99=
t know how to handle stakeholders well.=20
Zooming back, when I was first getting into the professional workplace deca=
des ago, I had the exact same feeling. I felt awkward. I felt like I didn't=
 fit. I felt like my professional skills were rusty because they'd never be=
en used.=20
Every time I learn a new skill, it's like that. Every time I begin again, i=
t's like that. When I first started putting videos up online, it was like t=
hat. And it's especially painful because that rough beginning is also the m=
oment our dreams are in flux and evolving, so we can feel lost. That's the =
moment our dreams have to change because we learn the realities of the worl=
d we=E2=80=99re entering. And it doesn=E2=80=99t match our expectations.
As an example of dreams changing, even before AI: in PM we learn the bitter=
 reality that if you are in a particular product management role for a whil=
e, there's no guarantee that you are really going to progress in your caree=
r. Especially above Senior PM, it gets very iffy. I think you=E2=80=99ll fi=
nd similar hidden ceilings everywhere, and those change our dreams too.
AI as an Enabler of New Dreams
And the thing that AI enables us to do in this world that has been hard at =
every other point in human history is it enables us to dream differently.=
=20
It gives us more flexibility on our dreaming. It gives us the ability to st=
retch our wings in new areas very easily. It's an incredible teaching tool,=
 yes. It's also a tool that enables us to practice our skills confidently.=
=20
We can practice our interview skills if that's what we're working on.=20
We can practice our coding skills if that's what we're working on.=20
We can get someone to help us read a new book and learn a new skill set fro=
m that book. If you want to learn the Why Machines Learn textbook by Anil=
=E2=80=94you can do that. You can literally take a picture of a complicated=
 diagram that you don't understand, and you can get AI to help you learn it=
=2E And that's just an example on my bo=
okshelf. You'll have others on your bo=
okshelf.
I know that "Red Bull gives you wings" is trademarked. I know we can't say =
"AI gives you wings," but that's the vibe. Especially because those Red Bul=
l videos are always absolutely terrifying.
And one of the things that I would like us to be able to do is to be honest=
 about the fact that even though AI gives us a lot of flexibility, it gives=
 us a lot of upside, it does mean a different world. It means our dreams ar=
e gonna be different because the world around us is changing so fast.
The New World of Work
I do not expect product management to be the same discipline in a year, two=
 years. It's already changing really, really fast. People are looking for b=
uilders of all kinds and they are increasingly less looking for particular =
defined roles that have particular defined expertise chains in a particular=
 job family. And that is leading to a lot of confusion and heartache.
That is why major companies can say AI automation engineers can apply to li=
terally any job in the company [ https://substack.com/redirect/0eebc468-630=
7-453b-a175-f302bf6d584a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
The new world is a confusing place. It=E2=80=99s not getting less confusing=
=2E
And so my encouragement is, if you have a Josh in your life, find a way to =
gently ask if they're open to having a conversation about the idea that the=
y might be welcome, useful, loved at work=E2=80=94their passion is importan=
t=E2=80=94but their dreams might need to shift.
And maybe ask yourself that too. Where do your dreams need to shift? Becaus=
e AI is coming for us all=E2=80=94not (I don=E2=80=99t think) coming in the=
 SkyNet sense, but coming in the sense of changing everything about the way=
 we work, changing how we interact in our personal lives, changing how we a=
re able to get from where we are today to where our dreams might be, and al=
ong the way changing where those dreams end up.
The Trade-Off We Live With
This is the trade-off we live with. We've taught the sand to think (approxi=
mately [ https://substack.com/redirect/3c99ac5c-66e4-4b81-89af-2964af3b51ad=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]), bu=
t because the sand thinks, everything is different now. And so it's up to u=
s to figure out how to turn this new cognitive revolution into something th=
at we can all participate in and all enjoy and all live with.
And if that sounds really kumbaya, feel free to roll your eyes, but it's a =
real conversation that we need to have. And the more we roll our eyes and s=
tep away from it, especially with the Joshes of this world, the more we cre=
ate a society where some people feel really left out on AI and really angry=
 about AI, that is not a society I wanna live in.
So talk to the Joshes in your life, and let=E2=80=99s talk together about h=
ow dreams are shifting in the age of AI.

. But Josh is at a local minima, which is a fancy way of saying he is stuck=
. Josh can't get the equipment that he needs for the podcast studio of his =
dreams, and (much more important) Josh can't get the contacts that he needs=
 to set up the conversations he=E2=80=99d like to have. That=E2=80=99s the =

his point. And all the AI coursework that he can find=E2=80=94and he does a=

 that don't fit as easily into that narrative of progress. And the reality =

/h4><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">And so besides telling Josh's story, I'll tell my own stor=
y a little bit. I got my start in a job that AI has changed dramatically. I=
 was doing nonprofit grant management. AI can do a lot of the work that I w=
as doing at the push of a button.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>Then I went over to=
 Oracle iStore management and conversion optimization. Conversion optimizat=
ion doesn't exist as a job anymore, really. Not even on LinkedIn. AI took i=
t away. And iStore=E2=80=94I mean, who has Oracle iStore anymore? I'm sure =
someone's gonna comment, &quot;</span><em>I have Oracle iStore</em><span>&q=
uot; after I publish this, but it=E2=80=99s not much of a job anymore.</spa=
n></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">And then after that I went and did marketing and I looke=
d at marketing attribution systems. Again, another area where AI has taken =
a lot of the work away. I looked at voice of customer at Amazon=E2=80=94alm=
ost totally automated by AI now.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You get the idea. </p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">And what's funny as I look at that list is that even though AI has=
 made huge strides, we still have people who handle grants, although now it=
=E2=80=99s often wrapped into a fundraising title. We still have people who=
 are working in web production and how to make excellent experiences on the=
 web, which is basically what conversion optimization does. We still have p=
eople who are focused on e-commerce management online, which is what I was =
doing with iStore. We still have people who are focused on learning from th=
e voice of the customer, which would be what I was doing when I was later i=
n my career at Amazon. We still have people who are focused on marketing an=
d understanding marketing data.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Those functions still have =
humans doing important work in those areas, but many of the individual day-=
to-day skills ended up getting peeled away. And that's one of the really in=
teresting things about the nature of work that I think we need to talk abou=
t more honestly with ourselves, with those around us, and with the Joshes i=
n our lives.</p><h4 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relativ=
