Welcome, Watcher!
This week's highlights:=20
NVIDIA=E2=80=99s new hybrid architecture that combes Mamba and Transformers=
 for 6x throughput gains=20
Synthetic data that breaks through the "data wall" and trains models 7x fas=
ter=20
Developer tools that reduce complex agent development from weeks to days=20
Reasoning systems that learn to =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=80=9D more efficiently, n=
ot just longer=20
Memory modules that inject domain-expertise into LLMs without retraining
Don't forget to subscribe to never miss an update again.
Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
Mamba-2 layer: A type of neural network layer with linear computational com=
plexity (vs quadratic for attention), making them much faster for long sequ=
ences - like having a highway instead of city streets for data flow.
Native-resolution ViT (NaViT): A vision transformer that processes images a=
t their original resolution rather than chopping them into fixed-size piece=
s - imagine reading a map without cutting it into squares first.
Pass@k: A metric measuring how often a model succeeds within k attempts - l=
ike giving a student multiple tries at a problem and checking if any are co=
rrect.
MoE (Mixture of Experts): An architecture where different "expert" sub-netw=
orks handle different inputs - like having specialist departments in a comp=
any rather than everyone doing everything.
Catastrophic forgetting: When fine-tuning a model on new data makes it forg=
et previously learned information - like studying for a chemistry exam so h=
ard you forget everything about history.
Policy entropy: A measure of how diverse a model's outputs are - high entro=
py means varied responses, low entropy means repetitive, predictable output=
s.
1. NVIDIA's Nemotron Nano 2: The Mamba-Transformer hybrid that changes ever=
ything
Watching: NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/ba2=
0da19-e8d1-42a4-813d-949f0cd0c109?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9h=
shgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Traditional Transformers hit a computational wa=
ll with long sequences - their quadratic complexity makes them painfully sl=
ow for reasoning tasks that generate thousands of tokens. You know that fru=
strating wait when GPT-4 is "thinking"? That's the quadratic complexity tax=
 you're paying.
How does it solve the problem? NVIDIA's engineers pulled off something clev=
er: they replaced most self-attention layers with Mamba-2 layers, creating =
a hybrid that keeps the best of both worlds. The architecture uses just 6 a=
ttention layers alongside 28 Mamba-2 layers and 28 FFN layers. It's like re=
placing most of your expensive consultants with efficient specialists who w=
ork just as well for 90% of tasks.
What are the key findings? Up to 6x higher throughput than comparable model=
s for generation-heavy tasks. A 9B parameter model that runs 128K context o=
n a single A10G GPU (just 22GB memory). The model was trained on 20 trillio=
n tokens, then compressed from 12B to 9B parameters while maintaining perfo=
rmance.
Why does it matter? With this, high-quality reasoning models can run on sin=
gle GPUs instead of clusters. For anyone building AI applications, this mea=
ns real-time inference for complex reasoning is now more economically viabl=
e than ever. The era of waiting 30 seconds for an AI response might be endi=
ng.
2. Ovis2.5: Native resolution vision that actually sees
Watching: Ovis2.5 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/85748b61-1bc7-44c9=
-a3a7-70e83255df2f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Current vision models have a dirty secret: they=
 chop up your images into tiles, destroying global context. Try showing GPT=
-4V a complex chart - it might miss relationships because it literally tore=
 the image apart to process it. Plus, most multimodal models can't really "=
think" about what they see - they just describe linearly.
How does it solve the problem? Ovis2.5 ditches the fixed-resolution approac=
h entirely, using Native-resolution ViT (NaViT) that processes images at th=
eir actual resolution (448=C2=B2 to 1792=C2=B2 pixels). But here's the kick=
er: it adds a "thinking mode" with <think>...</think> tags where the model =
can reflect, self-correct, and reason about visual content before answering=
=2E
What are the key findings? The 9B version achieves 78.3 on OpenCompass, whi=
ch is state-of-the-art for open-source models under 40B parameters. On OCRB=
ench, it scores 87.9, beating GPT-4o at reading text in images. The 2B vers=
ion hits 73.9, making it the best tiny multimodal model by a wide margin. C=
hart analysis performance is particularly impressive, finally matching huma=
n-level understanding of complex visualizations.
Why does it matter? We're entering an era where LLMs can truly "see" and re=
ason about visual information, not just describe it. For businesses dealing=
 with documents, charts, or technical diagrams, this is transformative. The=
 2B model makes on-device visual AI finally practical - imagine your phone =
understanding screenshots as well as you do.
3. BeyondWeb: When fake data becomes better than real data
Watching: BeyondWeb (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e27fc714-bccb-45=
77-8e48-6bcfecb09cc6?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6R=
xQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? We've hit the "data wall" - there isn't enough =
high-quality web text to train the next generation of models. Worse, most w=
eb data is blogs and news articles, but we want models that can have conver=
sations and follow instructions. It's like training a chef by only showing =
them restaurant reviews.
How does it solve the problem? Instead of generating new content from scrat=
ch, BeyondWeb rephrases existing web documents into higher-quality, diverse=
 formats. Think of it as hiring an editor to rewrite Wikipedia in the style=
 of textbooks, Q&As, and tutorials. The system uses smaller models (1B-8B p=
arameters) to transform web content at massive scale.
What are the key findings? Models trained on BeyondWeb reach the same perfo=
rmance 7.7x faster than those trained on raw web data. An 8B model trained =
on this synthetic data outperforms baselines by 7.1 percentage points acros=
s 14 benchmarks. Most surprisingly, a 3B model trained on BeyondWeb beats 8=
B models trained on other synthetic datasets.
Why does it matter? Smaller companies can now train competitive models with=
out scraping the entire internet. We're moving from a world where data quan=
tity matters to one where data curation and transformation are king. The "b=
igger is better" mantra just got another reality check.
4. GPT-OSS evaluation: When 120B parameters lose to 20B
Watching: GPT-OSS (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/4524a3f1-aa1f-4f3c=
-beeb-40cd36079647?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? OpenAI released their first open-weight models =
since GPT-2, but nobody knew if they were actually good. More fundamentally=
, do sparse MoE models follow the same scaling laws as dense models? The co=
mmunity needed rigorous evaluation to understand these models' place in the=
 ecosystem.
How does it solve the problem? Researchers ran comprehensive benchmarks com=
paring GPT-OSS (120B and 20B versions) against 6 contemporary models across=
 general knowledge, math, code, and multilingual tasks. They used statistic=
al significance testing to ensure results weren't just noise.
What are the key findings? Here's the shocker: gpt-oss-20B consistently out=
performs gpt-oss-120B on most benchmarks. On MMLU, the smaller model scores=
 69% vs 66%. The 20B model also uses 5x less energy per response. Both mode=
ls are mid-tier performers overall, with notable weaknesses in multilingual=
 tasks (below 45% on Chinese).
Why does it matter? This demolishes the assumption that parameter count equ=
als capability in sparse architectures. For practitioners, it's a clear mes=
sage: don't deploy the biggest model just because it's bigger. The finding =
that a 20B model beats a 120B one suggests we need new scaling laws for MoE=
 architectures.
5. Verifiable stepwise rewards: Teaching models not to overthink
Watching: Verifiable Stepwise Reward (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect=
/8d281025-65b4-4317-a715-8325d7b72f22?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQ=
Jf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Large reasoning models have developed a bad hab=
it: overthinking. They'll write pages of calculations for simple problems, =
like a student padding their essay to hit a word count. This wastes compute=
 and actually hurts accuracy on some tasks.
How does it solve the problem? The Verifiable Stepwise Reward Mechanism ass=
igns rewards based on whether each intermediate reasoning step actually hel=
ps. It's like having a teacher who marks each line of your proof, encouragi=
ng concise, effective reasoning while penalizing rambling.
What are the key findings? Models trained with this approach maintain reaso=
ning accuracy while substantially reducing output length. Overthinking freq=
uency drops significantly on benchmarks like AIME24 and AIME25. The method =
works with both PPO and Reinforce++ algorithms, making it widely applicable=
=2E
Why does it matter? As we deploy reasoning models at scale, efficiency beco=
mes crucial. This approach could cut inference costs by 30-50% while mainta=
ining quality. For applications like automated theorem proving or code gene=
ration, eliminating verbose reasoning could make the difference between pra=
ctical and prohibitively expensive.
6. SSRL: When models become their own search engines
Watching: Self-Search Reinforcement Learning (paper [ https://substack.com/=
redirect/addbb16f-6e95-43ca-ab60-fb220bb688ea?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy8=
8YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Training AI agents to search for information re=
quires expensive external search engines, creating bottlenecks and instabil=
ity. Methods like Search-R1 depend on Google or Bing APIs, which are costly=
 and can fail unpredictably during training.
How does it solve the problem? SSRL trains models to simulate search intern=
ally - they generate their own search results rather than querying external=
 sources. Through structured prompting and format-based rewards, models lea=
rn to produce realistic search outputs that improve their reasoning.
What are the key findings? Training is 5.53x faster than methods using exte=
rnal search. Models show strong scaling with inference budget and seamlessl=
y integrate with real search engines after training. On challenging benchma=
rks like BrowseComp, SSRL-trained models match or exceed those trained with=
 expensive external search.
Why does it matter? Companies can train search-capable agents without payin=
g for millions of API calls. The approach also suggests LLMs have more late=
nt knowledge than we thought - they just need the right training to access =
it efficiently.
7. Pass@k Training for Adaptively Balancing Exploration and Exploitation=20
Watching: Pass@k (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/18cda9c6-c00b-4167-=
b56a-d33239e17c46?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Reinforcement learning for reasoning models fac=
es a classic dilemma: exploit what works or explore new approaches? Current=
 methods using Pass@1 rewards make models conservative, converging to safe =
but suboptimal solutions - like a student who always uses the same problem-=
solving method even when better ones exist.
How does it solve the problem? Instead of rewarding only the single best at=
tempt, Pass@k training rewards multiple successful attempts, encouraging di=
verse problem-solving strategies. The method adaptively adjusts based on th=
e model's exploration level (measured by policy entropy), applying stronger=
 exploration incentives when needed.
What are the key findings? A 7B model trained with Pass@k surpasses GPT-4o =
and Claude-3.7 on reasoning benchmarks. The method prevents the typical ent=
ropy collapse seen in RL training, maintaining diverse solution strategies.=
 Performance improvements generalize to out-of-domain tasks, suggesting gen=
uine capability enhancement rather than overfitting.
Why does it matter? This proves smaller models can compete with giants thro=
ugh better training strategies. For the industry, it means competitive reas=
oning models might not require 100B+ parameters. The theoretical framework =
also provides a principled approach to the exploration-exploitation trade-o=
ff that's plagued RL for decades.
8. POML: The HTML for prompts
Watching: Prompt Orchestration Markup Language (paper [ https://substack.co=
m/redirect/7098f8ac-d4a6-4e79-aeff-e6176288db50?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdz=
y88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Prompt engineering is a mess. We're jamming com=
plex instructions, examples, and data into unstructured text, then wonderin=
g why small changes break everything. It's like writing web applications in=
 plain text files - possible, but painful.
How does it solve the problem? POML introduces HTML-like markup for prompts=
 with semantic components (<role>, <task>, <example>), built-in data handli=
ng (<document>, <table>, <img>), and CSS-like styling that separates conten=
t from presentation. A VSCode extension provides syntax highlighting, auto-=
completion, and live preview.
What are the key findings? A complex iOS agent (PomLink) was built in 2 day=
s with 90% time spent on UI, not prompts. In systematic testing, proper for=
matting improved model accuracy by up to 929% on GPT-3.5 and 4450% on Phi-3=
=2E Different models require different=20=
optimal formatting - POML makes this m=
anageable.
Why does it matter? Complex multi-modal applications become much more maint=
ainable. Teams can collaborate on prompts using version control. The dramat=
ic performance improvements from proper formatting suggest we've been leavi=
ng massive performance gains on the table.
9. Memory Decoder: Instant domain expertise for any LLM
Watching: Memory Decoder (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/10f291d9-45=
33-4b09-9fc4-1da6b760b150?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Making LLMs domain experts requires either expe=
nsive fine-tuning (which causes catastrophic forgetting) or slow RAG system=
s (2x inference overhead). For a lot of use cases, the overhead RAG creates=
 might not matter. But at scale, things can get painfully slow very quickly=
=2E It's like choosing between hiring a=
n expensive specialist or having a gen=
eralist constantly looking things up - both are suboptimal.
How does it solve the problem? Memory Decoder is a small (0.5B-1B) model th=
at learns to mimic retrieval behavior through specialized pretraining. Duri=
ng inference, it runs in parallel with the main LLM, with outputs interpola=
ted together. One Memory Decoder works with any model sharing the same toke=
nizer - true plug-and-play domain adaptation.
What are the key findings? A single 0.5B Memory Decoder enhances 11 differe=
nt models (0.5B to 72B parameters). Domain-specific perplexity drops by 76-=
79% in biomedicine and finance. Inference overhead is just 1.28x compared t=
o RAG's 2.17x. Remarkably, a 0.5B model with Memory Decoder outperforms van=
illa 72B models - that's 140x parameter efficiency.
Why does it matter? This could fundamentally change how we deploy specializ=
ed AI. Instead of training separate models for each domain, we can use modu=
lar memory components. For enterprises, this means one base model can serve=
 legal, medical, and financial teams with domain-specific memories. The cos=
t savings could be enormous.
The bigger picture: Efficiency is the new scale
This week's highlights reveal a fundamental shift in AI research philosophy=
=2E We're moving from "bigger is better=
" to "smarter goes harder." Whether it=
's hybrid architectures that cut inference costs 6x, synthetic data that tr=
ains models 7x faster, or reasoning methods that achieve more with less, th=
e message is clear: the next breakthrough isn't at 1 trillion parameters, i=
t's in doing more with what we have.
The tools are getting better too. POML makes complex prompt engineering man=
ageable. Memory Decoder makes domain adaptation modular.=20
Taken together, these advances will make AI much more accessible. When a 9B=
 model runs on a single GPU with 6x better throughput, or when synthetic da=
ta eliminates the need for massive web crawls, we're democratizing AI devel=
opment. The playing field is leveling, and that's good for everyone.

nt vision models have a dirty secret: they chop up your images into tiles, =
destroying global context. Try showing GPT-4V a complex chart - it might mi=
ss relationships because it literally tore the image apart to process it. P=
lus, most multimodal models can't really &quot;think&quot; about what they =
see - they just describe linearly.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=

it solve the problem?</strong><span> Ovis2.5 ditches the fixed-resolution a=
pproach entirely, using Native-resolution ViT (NaViT) that processes images=
 at their actual resolution (448=C2=B2 to 1792=C2=B2 pixels). But here's th=
e kicker: it adds a &quot;thinking mode&quot; with </span><code>&lt;think&g=

7.9, beating GPT-4o at reading text in images. The 2B version hits 73.9, ma=

ghlights reveal a fundamental shift in AI research philosophy. We're moving=
 from &quot;bigger is better&quot; to &quot;smarter goes harder.&quot; Whet=
her it's hybrid architectures that cut inference costs 6x, synthetic data t=
hat trains models 7x faster, or reasoning methods that achieve more with le=
ss, the message is clear: </span><strong>the next breakthrough isn't at 1 t=
rillion parameters, it's in doing more with what we have</strong><span>.</s=
pan></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=

rompt engineering manageable. Memory Decoder makes domain adaptation modula=
r. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">Taken together, these advances will make AI much more a=
ccessible. When a 9B model runs on a single GPU with 6x better throughput, =
or when synthetic data eliminates the need for massive web crawls, we're de=
mocratizing AI development. The playing field is leveling, and that's good =
for everyone.</p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"><hr styl=
