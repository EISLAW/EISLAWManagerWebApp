eeping-up-with-ai-youre-not

This one will be brief, but I think it=E2=80=99s important.
It=E2=80=99s not easy to keep up on AI, and the purpose of this post is to =
remind you you=E2=80=99re not alone. Share it with someone who needs to hea=
r that!=20
Yes, most of the time I write about easier ways to keep up on this Substack=
=2E That won=E2=80=99t stop. In fact, I=
 think it=E2=80=99s critically importa=
nt to socialize AI fluency because the stakes have never been higher.
But I also think we can take a moment every now and then to look squarely a=
t the overall landscape around us. We are all in a Red Queen race=E2=80=94a=
 race where we have to go fast just to stand still.=20
Here=E2=80=99s what that feels like=E2=80=A6
Subscribers get all these posts!
Waking up winded
The day starts with a soft chime from your phone=E2=80=94someone has droppe=
d a link to the latest =E2=80=9CGPT-something=E2=80=9D demo in the team cha=
t, complete with fire-emoji encouragements. You haven=E2=80=99t even tasted=
 coffee yet, but the thought arrives fully formed: I=E2=80=99m already behi=
nd. That feeling isn=E2=80=99t laziness; it=E2=80=99s the soundtrack of mod=
ern knowledge work, as common as the smell of instant espresso and the glar=
e of a ring-light. We used to greet the morning with a to-do list; now we g=
reet it with the suspicion we=E2=80=99ve missed a software release while we=
 slept.
Numbers back up that gut punch. Three out of four desk workers admit they f=
eel an =E2=80=9Curgent need=E2=80=9D to become AI experts, yet most have lo=
gged less than half a day of actual training. Executives aren=E2=80=99t imm=
une, either=E2=80=94nearly all say they feel relentless pressure to deploy =
generative tools across their organizations. In other words, the hierarchy =
offers no shelter: the anxiety flows upward and downward at the same speed,=
 pooled beneath every title and pay grade.
This mismatch=E2=80=94sky-high expectations paired with threadbare preparat=
ion=E2=80=94creates a peculiar morning ritual. We check email not for instr=
uctions but for evidence that we=E2=80=99re still in the race; we scroll Li=
nkedIn hoping today=E2=80=99s miracle workflow looks familiar; we skim head=
lines praying the acronym soup hasn=E2=80=99t gained another letter. The tr=
eadmill is already set to sprint when our feet touch it, and the speed dial=
 is broken off.
So if your first emotion at sunrise is exhaustion, know that it isn=E2=80=
=99t personal failure. It=E2=80=99s a logical human response to an environm=
ent that accelerates before you=E2=80=99ve had a chance to lace your shoes.=
 You wake up winded because the race began while you were asleep=E2=80=94an=
d the pace is being set by the machines, not us.
What the =E2=80=9CRed Queen race=E2=80=9D really means
Picture the scene in Through the Looking-Glass: Alice and the Red Queen run=
 so fast the landscape blurs, yet when they finally stop, they=E2=80=99re e=
xactly where they started. The Queen coolly explains that in her kingdom =
=E2=80=9Cit takes all the running you can do, to stay in the same place.=E2=
=80=9D Lewis Carroll meant it as whimsical logic, but the image has escaped=
 the book and lodged itself in modern jargon.
Biologists first adopted the metaphor to describe co-evolving species=E2=80=
=94gazelles get faster because cheetahs get faster, and vice versa. Economi=
sts borrowed it for markets in which every company invests just to match th=
e upgrades of rivals. In both cases, progress is relative; standing still i=
s the same as falling back because the ground beneath you is moving.
Now swap gazelles for knowledge workers and predators for product releases.=
 Each new model or feature resets the baseline of =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D =
productivity, so yesterday=E2=80=99s breakthrough becomes today=E2=80=99s m=
inimum expectation. You master a prompt style, the model changes its rules;=
 you learn a dashboard, the interface reinvents itself. Motion doesn=E2=80=
=99t feel optional=E2=80=94it feels baked into survival.
The unsettling part is that effort no longer guarantees distance. You can s=
print, debug, upskill, and still discover you=E2=80=99re only maintaining p=
arity with a moving target. That=E2=80=99s the Red Queen race in today=E2=
=80=99s office: relentless acceleration with no finish line, only the oblig=
ation to keep pace with everyone else who=E2=80=99s also running. Knowing t=
he term doesn=E2=80=99t slow the treadmill, but it puts a name to the dizzi=
ness, and sometimes that name is the first step toward breathing easier.
The news cycle that sprints faster than you can read
AI acceleration isn=E2=80=99t an abstract concept. You feel it in your body=
 these days.
Before you even open Slack, the headlines have already nudged the finish li=
ne. A late-night tweet hints at =E2=80=9CGPT-Next,=E2=80=9D financial repor=
ters run with it before dawn, and by breakfast the tech newsletters are sta=
cking speculation on top of rumor. The model isn=E2=80=99t released, benchm=
arked, or even named, yet the mere whisper is enough to declare yesterday=
=E2=80=99s knowledge obsolete. In that instant, your mental backlog doubles=
: learn what the new thing is, then decide whether you now look slow for no=
t knowing it already.
This isn=E2=80=99t classic hype, where marketing inflates a single product =
launch. It=E2=80=99s an always-on drumbeat that frames potential upgrades a=
s fait accompli. Journalists race one another for scoops; vendors tease roa=
d-maps to keep investors buzzing; influencers churn explainer threads so th=
ey can say =E2=80=9CFirst!=E2=80=9D when the embargo lifts. Each actor has =
a rational reason to accelerate the story, and together they create a colle=
ctive illusion that the ground is moving even faster than it is.
The result is a strange cognitive triage. You skim five articles, bookmark =
three deep dives, promise yourself you=E2=80=99ll =E2=80=9Ccircle back=E2=
=80=9D after lunch=E2=80=94then a push notification proclaims a competitor =
demoed something newer at a closed-door event. The stack of unread tabs bec=
omes a silent accusation: Why haven=E2=80=99t you processed me yet? Even if=
 half the rumors fade or the timelines slip, the psychological debt is alre=
ady charged to your attention span.
Over time the pace trains your nervous system to expect constant displaceme=
nt. You start reading with one eye on the horizon, ready for the next leap =
that will render the current leap pass=C3=A9. It=E2=80=99s less =E2=80=9Cfe=
ar of missing out=E2=80=9D and more =E2=80=9Ccertainty of being overtaken.=
=E2=80=9D And because the cycle resets every 24 hours, the sprint never res=
olves into a steady jog. The news moves faster than ink can dry=E2=80=94or =
than a human brain can integrate=E2=80=94leaving most of us breathless befo=
re the workday officially begins.
Prompting: a durable edge and a moving target
Prompting began as a party trick=E2=80=94type a clever sentence, watch the =
model jump. Then people noticed something deeper: the phrasing, ordering, a=
nd context you supply can swing outcomes from garbled to genius. In a world=
 awash with similar tools, that knack became a secret handshake, a way to s=
eparate the merely automated from the artfully amplified. Far from dying, t=
he craft has settled in as one of the few levers an individual can still pu=
ll to wring disproportionate value out of the same shared model.
But durability doesn=E2=80=99t equal stability. Each new release tweaks sys=
tem-message rules, swaps default =E2=80=9Cpersonalities,=E2=80=9D adjusts t=
oken limits, or introduces hidden steering logic. Yesterday=E2=80=99s elega=
nt chain-of-thought suddenly triggers truncation; the clever JSON wrapper y=
ou perfected now violates a stricter schema. Learning to prompt starts to f=
eel like mastering a foreign language whose grammar updates quarterly, week=
ly, or daily. The underlying principle=E2=80=94guide the model with precisi=
on=E2=80=94remains constant, yet the idiom keeps shifting under your feet.
That moving target raises the cost of sharpening the edge. Early adopters n=
ow spend lunch breaks running A/B tests, logging failures, and iterating pr=
ompts the way software engineers refactor code. Copy-pasting a template wor=
ks often enough, but the magic hides in micro-adjustments tuned to your dom=
ain, your dataset, your tolerance for hallucination. Craft replaces cookboo=
k, and you need both a library of prompts and the meta-skills to know how t=
o mix and match them to your context. The skills you banked last quarter ar=
e not worthless, just incomplete=E2=80=94tools in a set that needs perpetua=
l expansion.
The paradox is that as prompt engineering matures, it becomes both more ess=
ential and more opaque. Casual users see the outputs getting better and ass=
ume the interface has grown simpler. Insiders know the opposite is happenin=
g: the ceiling rises, but so does the expertise required to reach it. A dur=
able edge, then, is not a one-time certification; it=E2=80=99s a commitment=
 to ongoing whet-stone work, a readiness to revisit fundamentals whenever t=
he model=E2=80=99s rules of engagement shift.
And because mastery now demands constant tinkering, the simple act of keepi=
ng your prompts sharp doubles as a signal to colleagues that you=E2=80=99re=
 still sprinting. That signal, in turn, feeds the lateral pressure covered =
in the next section=E2=80=94the quiet competition where everyone=E2=80=99s =
refinement loop becomes someone else=E2=80=99s new baseline.
Peer-to-peer pressure inside companies
If the news cycle sets the treadmill in motion, colleagues crank the inclin=
e. Monday=E2=80=99s stand-up begins with one teammate demoing a slick AI wo=
rkflow that slashes a task from two hours to twenty minutes. Applause rippl=
es through the call, cameras flicker on to capture nods of admiration=E2=80=
=94and suddenly everyone else=E2=80=99s stopwatch feels embarrassingly slow=
=2E The benchmark hasn=E2=80=99t just inch=
ed upward; it has vaulted over your=
 weekend.
Managers, eager to scale that success, hold the demo up as proof of what sh=
ould be possible. Yet only a fraction of the team received formal training,=
 and those lessons were already dated by last quarter=E2=80=99s model updat=
e. The gap between the showcased =E2=80=9Cbest practice=E2=80=9D and the av=
erage comfort level widens into resentment. Surveys hint at the fallout: a =
meaningful slice of employees quietly resist or even sabotage AI roll-outs =
they feel unprepared for, preferring to take a performance hit rather than =
risk public failure.
That tension births a visibility arms race. Early adopters broadcast every =
shortcut to signal relevance; late adopters camouflage their learning curve=
s, hoping to avoid the spotlight until they=E2=80=99ve caught up. In chat t=
hreads you=E2=80=99ll find boasting (=E2=80=9CKnocked out the report in ten=
 minutes, thanks Gemini!=E2=80=9D) sitting alongside strategic silence=E2=
=80=94people who used the same tool but say nothing, worried the bar will c=
limb yet again if they reveal how. Transparency, the virtue that supposedly=
 powers knowledge work, turns selective and defensive in many cases.
Ironically, the Red Queen race is self-fueling: the more we display speed, =
the faster the collective pace becomes, forcing even reluctant runners to s=
print or risk appearing stationary. And because this pressure flows sideway=
s rather than down the org chart, it can escape leaders=E2=80=99 notice unt=
il friction blooms into missed deadlines or quiet attrition. The stage is s=
et for mandates=E2=80=94the moment when company policy, not just peer compa=
rison, codifies AI fluency as the new floor.=20
When urgency turns into mandate
Pressure stops being ambient when it=E2=80=99s written into a policy docume=
nt. On 7 April 2025, Shopify=E2=80=99s CEO Tobi L=C3=BCtke emailed staff a =
now-famous directive [ https://substack.com/redirect/04bc35b0-1c44-49d1-b06=
5-196f0e73a3e9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ]: before any team requests extra head-count, it must prove the wor=
k =E2=80=9Ccannot be done with AI.=E2=80=9D What had lurked as an unspoken =
expectation=E2=80=94of course you=E2=80=99re automating=E2=80=94became a fo=
rmal gating criterion. One memo, and reflexive AI use moved from competitiv=
e edge to company standard.
The ripple was immediate. Other firms, unwilling to look complacent, quietl=
y drafted similar language for annual planning decks and job descriptions. =
The message was clear: fluency is no longer bonus mileage; it=E2=80=99s the=
 price of admission. Where early adopters once earned kudos, late adopters =
now risk corrective action plans.
Mandates alter the emotional math. Until now, falling behind carried reputa=
tional sting; after a policy shift, it carries procedural consequences=E2=
=80=94approval bottlenecks, tighter performance reviews, stalled promotions=
=2E The Red Queen race grows teeth. Emp=
loyees who were jogging anxiously must=
 decide whether to sprint or step off the track entirely. Some double down =
on upskilling; others seek roles in smaller companies without hard AI quota=
s, creating a new talent migration pattern=E2=80=94but this feels perilous =
in a world where companies are rapidly adopting AI as a competitive advanta=
ge. The company you jump to may impose an AI mandate shortly, because compa=
nies themselves are engaged in a Red Queen race.
Naming what is happening
Look, this entire substack is dedicated to making it easier for you to keep=
 up. There will be lots more tips to come in future posts. But I think it=
=E2=80=99s worthwhile to take a moment occasionally to name what is happeni=
ng within many of us as well=E2=80=94to remind you you=E2=80=99re not alone=
=2E
First, there is grief=E2=80=94quiet, hard to admit, and easy to mislabel as=
 simple frustration. The familiar landscape of your craft is morphing so qu=
ickly you barely have time to wave goodbye to what you once mastered. Psych=
ologists call this anticipatory loss: the sorrow that something precious=E2=
=80=94your routine, your hard-won competence, perhaps even a piece of your =
professional identity=E2=80=94is slipping away before you can properly mour=
n it. You are not being dramatic; you are reacting like any human who sense=
s erosion at the foundations of expertise.
Next comes the gulf between promise and lived reality. Headlines shout =E2=
=80=9C2=C3=97 productivity with AI,=E2=80=9D but they edit out the hours sp=
ent coaxing models, debugging odd edge cases, and second-guessing whether t=
he gleaming output is actually correct. The marketing sizzle is all upside;=
 the cognitive bill arrives later, payable in decision fatigue and low-grad=
e anxiety. Living in that gap can feel like standing on a moving walkway th=
at refuses to match your stride.
Then there is the backstage-versus-highlight-reel effect. When colleagues d=
emo their polished workflows, you witness the final cut=E2=80=94smooth comm=
ands, instant graphs, neat takeaways. What you don=E2=80=99t see are their =
discarded drafts and midnight misfires. Meanwhile you=E2=80=99re painfully =
aware of every blooper in your own process: the prompts that looped, the da=
ta that mis-formatted, the afternoon lost to a stubborn API limit. It is ea=
sy to assume their ease is innate and your stumbles are unique, when in tru=
th everyone is editing out the messy middle.
Hold that collage of emotions for a moment. None of it points to laziness, =
inefficiency, or lack of talent. It simply reflects a treadmill that genuin=
ely has sped up beneath all of us. Naming the feelings does not slow the be=
lt, but it allows you to loosen the white-knuckle grip, breathe, and rememb=
er that the dizziness is shared=E2=80=94evidence of a system in overdrive, =
not of individual inadequacy.

-size: 16px;">That moving target raises the cost of sharpening the edge. Ea=
rly adopters now spend lunch breaks running A/B tests, logging failures, an=
d iterating prompts the way software engineers refactor code. Copy-pasting =
a template works often enough, but the magic hides in micro-adjustments tun=
ed to your domain, your dataset, your tolerance for hallucination. Craft re=
places cookbook, and you need both a library of prompts and the meta-skills=
 to know how to mix and match them to your context. The skills you banked l=
ast quarter are not worthless, just incomplete=E2=80=94tools in a set that =
needs perpetual expansion.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The paradox is that as prompt en=
gineering matures, it becomes both more essential and more opaque. Casual u=
sers see the outputs getting better and assume the interface has grown simp=
ler. Insiders know the opposite is happening: the ceiling rises, but so doe=
s the expertise required to reach it. A durable edge, then, is not a one-ti=
me certification; it=E2=80=99s a commitment to ongoing whet-stone work, a r=
eadiness to revisit fundamentals whenever the model=E2=80=99s rules of enga=
gement shift.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And because mastery now demands constant tink=
ering, the simple act of keeping your prompts sharp doubles as a signal to =
colleagues that you=E2=80=99re still sprinting. That signal, in turn, feeds=
 the lateral pressure covered in the next section=E2=80=94the quiet competi=
tion where everyone=E2=80=99s refinement loop becomes someone else=E2=80=99=
