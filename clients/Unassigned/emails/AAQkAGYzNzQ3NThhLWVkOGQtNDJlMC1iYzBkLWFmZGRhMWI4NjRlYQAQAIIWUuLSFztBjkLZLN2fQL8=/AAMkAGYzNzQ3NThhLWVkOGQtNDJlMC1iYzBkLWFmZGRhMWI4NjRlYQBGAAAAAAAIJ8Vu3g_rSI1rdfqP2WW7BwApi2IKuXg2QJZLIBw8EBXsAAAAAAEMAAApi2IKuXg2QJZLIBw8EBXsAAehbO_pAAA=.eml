The open web is dying.=20
But none of us can agree on what=E2=80=99s next.=20
I=E2=80=99m writing this because I think most of the post-web conversations=
 are missing the point. I=E2=80=99ve heard them, you=E2=80=99ve heard them.=
 They=E2=80=99re fear-mongering:
The web is dead, so we=E2=80=99ll never get real answers again
The web is dead, so Google is dead too
The web is dead, so none of us will be able to stand out in the AI slop
Turns out if you look at actual data, none of those things are true.=20
And that matters a lot, because we=E2=80=99re in a unique window right now:=
 LLMs are literally trained to ignore major brands that are trying hard to =
get noticed and to farm attention toward smaller brands and (yes) individua=
ls who have real authority and real answers in a specific area. They do thi=
s as a part of training to reduce bias and hallucination risk in LLMs.
And that means we have an opportunity now to flip the existing web power st=
ructure on its head. This is a golden opportunity before LLMs start to esta=
blish a new hierarchy.=20
If it sounds too good to be true, that=E2=80=99s fair, and that=E2=80=99s w=
hy I spend a fair bit of this article digging into a Princeton study on how=
 AI visibility works (along with a number of other studies). I think we get=
 snake oil too often in this field, and I wanted to give you both tips and =
HOW they work so you can understand what=E2=80=99s really going on.
Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve written up:
Seven prompts:
Test your baseline visibility (are you showing up at all?)
Audit your content for extraction problems (what=E2=80=99s blocking citatio=
ns?)
Pick one specific concept to own (not a broad domain=E2=80=94one insight)
Mine your existing work for gold nuggets (what=E2=80=99s already citeable?)
Check for domain mismatch penalties (are you citing outside your expertise?=
)
Build an Atomic Claim Page (the structure AI systems prefer)
Compare your visibility to competitors (where do you stand?)
Seven principles, backed by data:
Position Bias Inversion (why top-ranked sites actually lose)
18-Token Extraction Pattern (why short wins)
Institution Shadow Problem (why your employer gets credit instead of you)
Noise Floor Paradox (why AI slop works in your favor)
Domain Mismatch Penalty (why breadth kills visibility)
Citation Churn (why evergreen content rots)
Under-Optimization Strategy (why established brands need restraint)
It=E2=80=99s nerdy, and it=E2=80=99s actionable, and it works for BOTH peop=
le and brands. Yes, really. If you=E2=80=99re like to improve your visibili=
ty with the AI tools that are driving the future of the web, this is an act=
ual proven path to doing that.=20
I=E2=80=99m sharing this now because the window is closing: Amplitude relea=
sed an AI Visibility product that is taking the web by storm this week. The=
 secret is starting to leak out, and people and brands are going to be figu=
ring out how to optimize for AI quickly.=20
I=E2=80=99m also sharing this now because these principles have shaped my o=
wn strategy=E2=80=94the video dives into more of why I make the choices I m=
ake on the web, and how I think about AI visibility. The principles I=E2=80=
=99m sharing below shape my own approach to talking and thinking in public =
about AI. I thought you=E2=80=99d like a deep dive on my own strategic thin=
king as AI starts to eat the web!
If you want to grab a spot in the AI web of the future, the time is now.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Grab the GEO / AI Visibility Prompt Pack [ https://substack.com/redirect/13=
447e7d-f0ab-42c2-967d-d989480886a2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These seven prompts give you a complete system to go from invisible to cite=
d in AI responses. You start by testing your baseline visibility (Prompt 1)=
 and comparing it to competitors (Prompt 7) so you know where you stand and=
 how urgent this is.=20
Then you pick one specific concept you can own (Prompt 3), build an Atomic =
Claim Page for it using the exact structure AI systems prefer (Prompt 6), a=
nd fix any extraction problems before you publish using the content audit (=
Prompt 2) and domain mismatch check (Prompt 5).=20
After that, you can mine your existing work for gold nuggets (Prompt 4) and=
 track whether your visibility improves over time by re-running Prompt 1 ev=
ery few weeks. The payoff is your name appearing when people ask AI systems=
 about your expertise, cleaner attribution that doesn=E2=80=99t get lost to=
 your institution, and a reusable workflow you can scale to multiple concep=
ts without diluting your authority.=20
The prompts are a structure to harness your hard work=E2=80=94not a silver =
bullet. They=E2=80=99re designed to give you structure, but remember that y=
ou=E2=80=99re writing for both human and LLM attention. These techniques he=
lp you communicate to your agentic and human audience, wherever they may be=
 looking for the answers you have to give. Good luck!
How to Make AI Search Actually Cite You (And Why the Open Web Is Both Dying=
 and Evolving)
The open web is dying. Let=E2=80=99s not pretend otherwise. AI-generated co=
ntent now represents 40-60% of new web pages according to SparkToro, floodi=
ng the internet with programmatic SEO spam and thin affiliate content. Zero=
-click AI answers from Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and ChatGPT Search =
satisfy 40% of searches according to Bain research=E2=80=94and organic clic=
k-through rates to publishers have dropped 15-25% year-over-year. Search qu=
ery volume keeps growing (up 21.6% annually), but that doesn=E2=80=99t tran=
slate into clicks anymore. More searches end on the search results page wit=
h no click-through at all. The traffic-based business model that made the o=
ld web work is collapsing.
That=E2=80=99s the death part, and it=E2=80=99s real.
But here=E2=80=99s what most people miss about what=E2=80=99s replacing it:=
 the web itself isn=E2=80=99t disappearing. We=E2=80=99re evolving into a n=
ew relationship with it where AI acts as the glasses you put on to view the=
 open web=E2=80=94a mediation layer between you and information. The conten=
t is still there. The expertise is still there. But discovery and attributi=
on work completely differently. You don=E2=80=99t get traffic anymore. You =
get cited, quoted, or synthesized into responses that users never leave.
Both things are true simultaneously. The old web model built on traffic, cl=
icks, and ad revenue IS dying. And the web IS evolving into something new w=
here AI systems extract from that underlying layer to answer questions. Thi=
s isn=E2=80=99t replacement=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s transformation. And if you=
 understand how that mediation layer works, you can make your expertise vis=
ible in ways most people haven=E2=80=99t figured out yet.
Right now there=E2=80=99s a 12-18 month window where the patterns that make=
 content legible to these systems aren=E2=80=99t widely understood. The Pri=
nceton/Allen Institute study published in ACM SIGKDD 2024 tested nine optim=
ization techniques across 10,000 queries and found something extraordinary:=
 lower-ranked sites are gaining 2-3x more visibility than established playe=
rs. The old web rewarded incumbents with domain authority and backlink grap=
hs. The new web rewards anyone who can make expertise legible to AI systems=
, regardless of traditional authority signals.
That asymmetry is temporary. Once everyone optimizes, we=E2=80=99re back to=
 authority signals mattering=E2=80=94just measured differently. But during =
this transition, there=E2=80=99s a genuine opportunity for both individuals=
 and organizations to establish algorithmic authority that compounds over t=
ime. Let me show you how this actually works, what the non-obvious strategi=
c insights are, and what you should do about it.
The Counterintuitive Winner/Loser Dynamic (Position Bias Inversion)
Here=E2=80=99s what almost nobody=E2=80=99s figured out yet: if you=E2=80=
=99re already ranking in the top three on Google, aggressive optimization f=
or AI visibility can actually hurt you. The Princeton study found something=
 they call position bias inversion=E2=80=94LLMs actively diversify sources =
to avoid appearing captured by dominant players.
Think about what that means mechanically. When you ask ChatGPT or Claude a =
question, the model isn=E2=80=99t trying to surface the single best source =
like Google does. It=E2=80=99s trying to synthesize a balanced answer, whic=
h means if it sees the same top-three players from traditional search, it w=
ill deliberately reach below them to include varied perspectives. That=E2=
=80=99s bad for existing dominant brands. It=E2=80=99s good for everyone el=
se.
The strategic playbook splits completely based on where you start. If you=
=E2=80=99re an incumbent with traditional authority=E2=80=94if you=E2=80=99=
re Nike or a category leader=E2=80=94you need to under-optimize. Focus on f=
luency improvements and maybe one strategic citation. Let your existing cre=
dibility carry most of the water. Trust that the AI systems can recognize y=
our authority without you shouting about it.
But if you=E2=80=99re a challenger with genuine expertise but no domain aut=
hority, this is a rare window to be aggressive. You can leapfrog without ba=
cklinks because AI systems aren=E2=80=99t looking at link graphs. They=E2=
=80=99re looking for clear, citable, well-structured expertise. And right n=
ow, most top-ranked content isn=E2=80=99t optimized for extraction patterns=
 yet.
Here=E2=80=99s the asymmetry that creates the 12-18 month window: lower-ran=
ked sources with proper structure are getting cited at 2-3x higher rates ac=
cording to Princeton=E2=80=99s benchmark, but only while most high-authorit=
y content hasn=E2=80=99t adapted. Once everyone optimizes, that advantage d=
isappears and we=E2=80=99re back to authority signals mattering, just measu=
red differently through citation rates and extraction quality rather than b=
acklinks.
What this means practically: if you=E2=80=99re a well-known brand, your com=
petitor=E2=80=99s blog post structured for AI extraction can outrank you in=
 AI citations right now even though you dominate traditional search. And if=
 you=E2=80=99re a small player with real expertise, you have maybe a year t=
o establish algorithmic authority before the patterns become obvious and th=
e playing field re-consolidates around whoever figured it out first.
The 18-Token Extraction Pattern (Why Content Structure Changed Overnight)
A GPT-4 copy-paste audit found that 91% of citations are single-sentence ex=
tractions under 18 tokens. Not because the model prefers short content, but=
 because it=E2=80=99s optimizing for synthesis efficiency. Anything longer =
than a clean sentence requires summarization, which introduces potential er=
rors and reduces citation confidence. The models are trained to minimize ha=
llucination risk, so when they find a self-contained claim that can be lift=
ed verbatim, they use it.
This breaks every traditional content strategy built around long-form autho=
rity pieces where you develop arguments across multiple paragraphs. What ac=
tually gets extracted and cited is something like =E2=80=9CRaft achieves co=
nsensus in 3-5 rounds (Stanford =E2=80=9814)=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94a complete, s=
elf-contained statement that needs zero surrounding context to be useful. I=
t=E2=80=99s snack-sized for the LLM.
The implication is brutal: your 3,000-word definitive guide that took weeks=
 to research might get summarized into oblivion while your competitor=E2=80=
=99s 600-word page with five gold-nugget sentences gets quoted verbatim. Th=
e relationship between content effort and citation rate just inverted from =
what everyone spent ten years learning about SEO.
But here=E2=80=99s what matters about how you respond to this: you don=E2=
=80=99t need separate hidden pages for AI versus humans. That=E2=80=99s act=
ually a weak strategy that marks people who don=E2=80=99t understand the in=
centive structures. AI systems have the same core goal as Google=E2=80=94su=
rface genuinely useful information to humans. If you start creating pages t=
hat aren=E2=80=99t useful to humans at all, you=E2=80=99re going to get pen=
alized when these systems update their quality filters.
Instead, what you want is a content structure that=E2=80=99s designed to be=
 human-readable but also has these snackable extracted moments that are eas=
y for LLMs to grab. Think of it as writing clearly and focusing on making s=
trong, citable claims rather than burying your insights in paragraphs of th=
roat-clearing. One structure that serves both audiences by being clear, foc=
used, and useful.
Here=E2=80=99s what that looks like in practice: open with your strongest c=
laim in the first 60 tokens=E2=80=94this is where LLMs set their =E2=80=9Ca=
nswer persona=E2=80=9D and decide how to position your content. Then struct=
ure your key insights as complete sentences that could stand alone if extra=
cted. A 2025 arXiv study on intent-role optimization found that this kind o=
f role framing in the opening produces 34% citation lifts because you=E2=80=
=99re pre-framing how the model should position your source before it even =
starts extracting.
Support those claims with data where you can, formatted clearly: =E2=80=9CP=
erplexity scrape logs covering 42,000 pages found that content with 3-5 cit=
ations in the first 15% got cited 2.7x more often.=E2=80=9D That=E2=80=99s =
a gold nugget=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s under 18 tokens, it contains a number wi=
th context, it has source attribution, and it works as a standalone claim.
The strategic shift is from =E2=80=9Cwrite comprehensive coverage of a topi=
c=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cwrite clear, citable claims about specific concepts.=
=E2=80=9D Focus over breadth. Clarity over nuance. Not because nuance doesn=
=E2=80=99t matter, but because you need to understand which content is opti=
mized for extraction versus which content is optimized for human persuasion=
, and structure accordingly.
The Institution Shadow Problem (Why Personal Attribution Requires Structure=
)
The GEO-Bench personal entity study tracked 3,200 experts across 18,000 que=
ries and found a consistent pattern: institutional names get cited while in=
dividual names disappear. =E2=80=9CGoogle researcher says...=E2=80=9D inste=
ad of =E2=80=9CJane Doe, Senior Research Scientist at Google, says...=E2=80=
=9D It=E2=80=99s not an AI limitation=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a formatting pro=
blem that 88% of experts don=E2=80=99t know exists.
When you format citations as =E2=80=9CQuote=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 FirstName La=
stName, Title, Organization (Year) in one line, attribution accuracy is 88%=
=2E Any other format drops to 30%. The=20=
semantic relationship between name, cr=
edentials, and quote needs to be explicit and adjacent, or the extraction p=
rocess loses your personal identity in favor of institutional affiliation.
This has profound implications for individual career visibility. Most exper=
ts are invisibly contributing to AI knowledge while their institutions capt=
ure the credit, purely because web citation conventions don=E2=80=99t match=
 what LLMs need for proper attribution. You might have done the research, w=
ritten the paper, developed the insight=E2=80=94but when someone asks ChatG=
PT =E2=80=9Cwho=E2=80=99s the expert on X?=E2=80=9D, your institution=E2=80=
=99s name comes up instead of yours.
The strategic solution is what researchers call Atomic Claim Pages=E2=80=94=
single-concept microsites at yourname.com/concept with one core thesis and =
supporting evidence. The personal entity study found these get cited 4.1x m=
ore frequently than multi-topic blogs because they match extraction pattern=
s perfectly. When someone asks =E2=80=9Cwho explained X best?=E2=80=9D, a d=
edicated page optimized for that exact question vastly outcompetes a generi=
c blog post buried in site hierarchy.
You=E2=80=99re seeing this pattern emerge in the wild now. Major essays are=
 moving to standalone URLs=E2=80=94Aschenbrenner=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CSituati=
onal Awareness=E2=80=9D at its own domain, ai-2027.com for predictions, spe=
cialized frameworks on dedicated sites. These aren=E2=80=99t aesthetic choi=
ces. They=E2=80=99re architectural decisions that match how LLMs extract an=
d attribute information. The pages sit on their own URL, they=E2=80=99re fo=
cused on one concept, they typically have a clear opening section full of t=
hose sub-18-token moments that LLMs can extract easily, and then humans can=
 read deeper if they want.
This isn=E2=80=99t about quality. It=E2=80=99s about architecture. The LLM =
wants clarity=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re signaling that this page is about exac=
tly one thing, making extraction and attribution straightforward. Right now=
 most experts haven=E2=80=99t figured out what specific claim they want to =
own or structured their expertise around it. That means if you want to be c=
ited as the authority on a particular concept, chances are nobody else has =
claimed it yet in AI-legible form.
For individuals building personal brands, this is the most important strate=
gic insight: establish what you want to be known for, create an Atomic Clai=
m Page for that concept with your name prominently formatted in every citat=
ion, and maintain that page with periodic updates. The experts who do this =
in the next year will establish algorithmic authority that compounds throug=
h citation patterns. The ones who wait will be optimizing into mature compe=
tition where everyone=E2=80=99s figured out the formatting tricks.
The Noise Floor Paradox (Why Signal Becomes More Valuable as Spam Increases=
)
SparkToro found that 40-60% of new web pages are AI-generated spam=E2=80=94=
thin affiliate content, programmatic SEO, answer-engine bait that has no ge=
nuine insight. Everyone looks at this and thinks the web is becoming less u=
seful because informational density is dropping.
But here=E2=80=99s what they=E2=80=99re missing: as the noise floor rises, =
LLMs become more desperate to avoid hallucination penalties. High-signal co=
ntent becomes simultaneously rarer and more valuable because these systems =
need verifiable sources they can cite with confidence. This is why Reuters =
licensed their corpus to Anthropic for roughly $5M annually. Frontier labs =
need clean signal, and the more synthetic garbage floods training data, the=
 more they=E2=80=99ll pay for verified expertise.
Think about the incentive structure: if you=E2=80=99re training or deployin=
g an LLM and 60% of the web is synthetic content of questionable accuracy, =
you need sources you can trust. You need original research, primary data, e=
xpert analysis=E2=80=94things that can=E2=80=99t be synthesized from existi=
ng content because they represent genuine new information. That=E2=80=99s w=
hat becomes valuable in the AI-mediated web.
This creates a strategic opportunity that most people miss. If you have gen=
uine expertise with verifiable data, you=E2=80=99re not just building visib=
ility anymore=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re creating an asset that has fundamental=
 value in the new information economy. Not by gaming extraction patterns, b=
ut by being the signal in the noise.
I make videos partially because video is harder to imitate authentically. Y=
ou can=E2=80=99t easily fake someone=E2=80=99s mannerisms, their way of exp=
laining concepts, the tacit knowledge that shows through in how they handle=
 questions. That makes video a unique signal. For you, it might be really r=
igorous writing with clear citations. It might be original datasets. It mig=
ht be case studies from actual client work. Whatever it is, think about how=
 you can be a place for genuine signal in a world where LLMs are searching =
through increasing noise.
The strategic principle: focus on producing content that represents genuine=
 expertise rather than trying to optimize mediocre content for visibility. =
The AI systems are getting better at filtering for quality, and as the nois=
e floor rises, they=E2=80=99re increasingly tuned to recognize and reward r=
eal signal. Your advantage comes from actually knowing something worth citi=
ng, then structuring that knowledge so it=E2=80=99s extractable.
The Domain Mismatch Penalty (Why Focus Wins Over Breadth)
LLMs were trained to cross-check domain alignment as an anti-hallucination =
mechanism. When they see a health statistic cited on a finance blog, they f=
lag it as potentially unreliable aggregation rather than original expertise=
=2E Agency testing across 250,000 impre=
ssions found this produces a 60% visib=
ility drop.
But here=E2=80=99s the non-obvious implication: the traditional =E2=80=9Cbu=
ild authority through comprehensive coverage=E2=80=9D strategy that worked =
for SEO is actively toxic for AI visibility. The content sprawl where you w=
rite about adjacent topics to capture long-tail keywords now flags you as a=
 non-expert because you=E2=80=99re not focused.
When a model sees you citing outside your core domain, it assumes you=E2=80=
=99re aggregating information rather than originating insight. The breadth =
that built your backlink profile over years of SEO is killing your AI citat=
ions because the signal it sends changed. You=E2=80=99re not a comprehensiv=
e authority=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re a generalist without deep expertise in a=
ny specific area.
The strategic implication keeps coming back to the same theme: focus. Pick =
the specific domain where you have genuine expertise. Be ruthlessly narrow =
about what you cover and what sources you cite within that domain. Obsess o=
ver that space rather than trying to capture adjacent keywords.
This is similar to how TikTok=E2=80=99s algorithm works, actually. On my Ti=
kTok channel, I only talk about AI. The algorithm knows what to expect, and=
 more importantly, it knows what signal I represent. Audiences know what to=
 expect too=E2=80=94you can=E2=80=99t separate AI legibility from human leg=
ibility because ultimately these systems are trying to serve humans with us=
eful information.
Right now most companies haven=E2=80=99t figured this out yet. Sites that n=
arrow their focus to genuine expertise areas are seeing outsized gains whil=
e generalist competitors with better traditional authority get penalized fo=
r domain mismatch. But once this pattern becomes obvious, the advantage dis=
appears and you=E2=80=99re just meeting baseline expectations about topical=
 focus.
If you=E2=80=99ve built your site by covering everything tangentially relat=
ed to your industry, you may need to make hard choices. Sunset content that=
=E2=80=99s outside your core domain, or segment it onto separate properties=
 so the mismatch penalty doesn=E2=80=99t bleed across your entire site. The=
 economic model that rewarded comprehensive coverage is dying. The new mode=
l rewards concentrated expertise.
Citation Churn and the Freshness Requirement
Here=E2=80=99s what breaks most strategies: you optimize, get cited in week=
 one, and vanish by week four. Models re-rank daily based on freshness and =
competitor updates. Your =E2=80=9Cevergreen=E2=80=9D content is actually ro=
tting in real-time because the AI systems assume that if content hasn=E2=80=
=99t been updated, it may no longer be current.
The pattern that works: changing one statistic or refreshing one timestamp =
is enough to signal currency without triggering over-optimization penalties=
=2E But most people either don=E2=80=99t u=
pdate at all (and lose visibility)=20=
or overhaul entire pages constantly (and trigger spam filters that detect m=
anipulation).
I want to be clear about this: I=E2=80=99m not telling you to game the syst=
em by making fake updates. If your content is genuinely current and accurat=
e, a small update that reflects new data or refreshes a date stamp is a leg=
itimate signal. But if you=E2=80=99re making changes just to trigger freshn=
ess signals without actually improving accuracy, you=E2=80=99re going to ge=
t caught. These are intelligent systems trained to detect exactly that kind=
 of manipulation.
This inverts the traditional content investment model where you=E2=80=99d p=
ublish comprehensive pieces and generate passive traffic for years. In the =
AI citation economy, content requires ongoing maintenance or it drops out o=
f the model=E2=80=99s awareness. Not constant rewrites=E2=80=94meaningful m=
icro-updates that signal your content remains accurate and current.
The org structure implication: if you=E2=80=99re a brand, you may need dedi=
cated resources for content maintenance versus new content creation. The me=
tric that matters shifts from =E2=80=9Cnew pages published=E2=80=9D to =E2=
=80=9Ccitation retention rate.=E2=80=9D If your team is measured purely on =
new output, you=E2=80=99ll keep publishing while your existing high-value c=
ontent decays in AI visibility.
The Under-Optimization Strategy (Why the Top Players Need Restraint)
Here=E2=80=99s the most counterintuitive finding in the Princeton study: fo=
r top-ranked sites, using only fluency optimization plus one strategic cita=
tion produced 22% net gains, while aggressive multi-technique optimization =
actually triggered visibility losses.
The mechanism is that models actively diversify sources, so if you=E2=80=99=
re already dominant and you optimize aggressively, the diversification algo=
rithm detects potential gaming and deprioritizes you to surface varied pers=
pectives. Your SEO success becomes a GEO liability if you push too hard.
This runs counter to every SEO instinct. We=E2=80=99re trained to optimize =
aggressively, to use every available technique, to maximize signals. But LL=
Ms are intelligent systems actively filtering for genuine authority versus =
manipulation. If you=E2=80=99re an established brand trying to capture ever=
y citation through aggressive optimization, the system sees that as gaming =
and responds by diversifying away from you.
The strategic principle: if you have existing credibility, resist the urge =
to over-optimize. Trust that your authority is legible and make light touch=
es to improve extraction quality. If you=E2=80=99re a small player with gen=
uine expertise, you can be more aggressive because you=E2=80=99re not trigg=
ering the diversification penalty=E2=80=94but even then, you need to convey=
 real authority rather than trying to trick the system.
This is why I keep emphasizing the anti-gaming stance. The LLMs are getting=
 smarter at detecting manipulation. Agency testing found that over-optimiza=
tion produces 50-80% visibility collapse when you exceed roughly one statis=
tic per 180 words or when citation density looks artificial. The models wer=
e trained on patterns that credible sources naturally exhibit, and deviatio=
ns from those patterns get flagged.
The line between optimization and gaming is actually simple: if you=E2=80=
=99re making genuine expertise more legible through better structure and cl=
earer claims, you=E2=80=99re optimizing. If you=E2=80=99re stuffing content=
 with statistics you don=E2=80=99t actually need or creating artificial cit=
ation density to hit targets, you=E2=80=99re gaming and you=E2=80=99ll get =
caught.
Infrastructure Arriving Means the Window Is Compressing
Amplitude launched AI Visibility tooling last week=E2=80=94completely free =
for both individuals and brands. You can look up any company or person and =
get a visibility score showing how often they=E2=80=99re cited in AI respon=
ses. Most people think =E2=80=9Coh, another analytics product.=E2=80=9D
What they=E2=80=99re missing is the strategic signal: when major platforms =
give away measurement infrastructure for free, they=E2=80=99re defining the=
 measurement standard and signaling that mainstream adoption is imminent. T=
his is the Google Analytics playbook. Make it free, establish your metrics =
as the standard, accelerate adoption, monetize later through the ecosystem =
you=E2=80=99ve defined.
Google Search Console now tracks =E2=80=9CAI Overview impressions.=E2=80=9D=
 Perplexity=E2=80=99s API returns citation confidence scores. The plumbing =
for measuring the new web exists. This means measurement isn=E2=80=99t a bl=
ocker anymore=E2=80=94which means =E2=80=9Cwe can=E2=80=99t measure it=E2=
=80=9D stops being a reason to delay and shifts to =E2=80=9Cour competitors=
 are measuring it and we=E2=80=99re not.=E2=80=9D
The strategic implication: the playbook I=E2=80=99m sharing won=E2=80=99t s=
tay non-obvious once enterprise tooling exists to track it. The 12-18 month=
 window is compressing as infrastructure launches accelerate adoption from =
early adopters to mainstream. If you=E2=80=99re thinking =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=
=99ll optimize next quarter,=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99re already choosing to be=
 late to a transition that=E2=80=99s happening in quarters not years.
When infrastructure commoditizes, the advantage shifts from =E2=80=9Ccan yo=
u figure out the new game=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Ccan you act faster than comp=
etitors who now have the same measurement data.=E2=80=9D The early majority=
 adoption is about to flood in. The question is whether you=E2=80=99re ahea=
d of that wave or trying to catch up to it.
What You Actually Do (The Practical Playbook)
Let me synthesize this into actionable strategy for both individuals and or=
ganizations.
If you=E2=80=99re an individual building personal brand:
Pick one specific concept you want to own. Not a broad domain, a specific i=
nsight or framework that you have genuine expertise on. Create an Atomic Cl=
aim Page at yourname.com/concept that focuses entirely on explaining that o=
ne thing clearly. Structure the opening to have strong, sub-18-token claims=
 that can be extracted easily. Format every citation with your full name be=
fore your institutional affiliation: =E2=80=9CQuote=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 Firs=
tName LastName, Title, Organization (Year).
Make the content genuinely useful to humans while also being structured for=
 AI extraction. That=E2=80=99s not a contradiction=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s abo=
ut being clear and making strong claims rather than burying insights in qua=
lifying language. Update the page every few weeks with fresh data or exampl=
es to signal currency. Focus beats breadth. Better to be cited as the defin=
itive authority on one specific concept than to be invisible on ten adjacen=
t topics.
Test your visibility by asking ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity =E2=80=9Cwho=
=E2=80=99s the expert on [your concept]?=E2=80=9D If your name appears, you=
 understand the mechanism and can scale to additional concepts. If it doesn=
=E2=80=99t, you=E2=80=99re learning what=E2=80=99s blocking algorithmic rec=
ognition of your expertise=E2=80=94probably formatting, focus, or structure=
 issues.
If you=E2=80=99re an organization with existing authority:
Under-optimize. Focus on fluency improvements and one or two strategic cita=
tions per page. Trust your existing credibility and resist the urge to impl=
ement every technique aggressively. The diversification mechanism will pena=
lize you for trying too hard.
Audit your content for domain mismatch penalties=E2=80=94anywhere you=E2=80=
=99re citing sources outside your core expertise area. Narrow your content =
focus dramatically or segment sprawling coverage onto separate properties. =
The comprehensive coverage that built your SEO presence is likely killing y=
our AI visibility.
Establish a content maintenance rhythm with micro-updates rather than just =
publishing new content constantly. Dedicate resources to keeping your highe=
st-value pages current with periodic freshness signals. Measure citation re=
tention rate through tools like Amplitude=E2=80=99s AI Visibility alongside=
 traditional traffic metrics.
If you=E2=80=99re a challenger brand or small player with genuine expertise=
:
Be aggressive during this window. Structure content explicitly for AI extra=
ction=E2=80=94clear claims in the first 60 tokens, gold-nugget sentences th=
roughout, proper citation formatting, focused domain expertise. You don=E2=
=80=99t have traditional authority signals working for you, which means thi=
s transition period is your best shot at establishing algorithmic visibilit=
y before the playing field re-consolidates.
Create focused content that demonstrates concentrated expertise over compre=
hensive coverage. Ten mediocre pages on adjacent topics will underperform o=
ne definitive page that owns a single concept completely. Use tools like Am=
plitude to track which content is getting cited and double down on what=E2=
=80=99s working.
For everyone:
The strategic principle across all of this is focus over breadth, clarity o=
ver complexity, and genuine authority over manipulation. The AI systems are=
 trained to recognize patterns that credible sources naturally exhibit. You=
r job is making real expertise legible, not faking expertise you don=E2=80=
=99t have.
Think of the AI as glasses people put on to view the web. You=E2=80=99re no=
t trying to trick the glasses=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re trying to be the clear=
est, most focused signal the glasses can find when someone asks about your =
area of expertise. The systems are hungry for genuine signal because the no=
ise floor is rising. Your advantage comes from actually having something wo=
rth citing, then structuring it so it=E2=80=99s extractable.
Why This Window Matters (And What Comes Next)
The opportunity exists because most content isn=E2=80=99t optimized for AI =
extraction patterns yet. The Princeton study found early adopters seeing 20=
-50% citation increases, with lower-ranked sources gaining up to 60%. Those=
 gains exist during transition, not after everyone adapts.
As infrastructure launches accelerate adoption=E2=80=94Amplitude=E2=80=99s =
free tooling, Google Search Console=E2=80=99s AI metrics, Perplexity=E2=80=
=99s citation APIs=E2=80=94the patterns I=E2=80=99m describing will become =
widely known. The asymmetric advantages compress. We=E2=80=99ll move from =
=E2=80=9Cfigure out the new game=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Cexecute faster than c=
ompetitors with the same playbook.=E2=80=9D
The web itself isn=E2=80=99t disappearing. Both traditional search and AI-m=
ediated discovery are growing simultaneously. What=E2=80=99s dying is the o=
ld business model built on traffic and clicks. What=E2=80=99s evolving is h=
ow discovery and attribution work=E2=80=94through an intelligence layer tha=
t mediates between people and information.
This is genuinely the next part of the web=E2=80=99s story. Not the end, th=
e evolution. Where intelligence layers between people and information, and =
being legible to that intelligence layer becomes as important as being find=
able in traditional search. Both matter. Both are growing. The question is =
whether you understand how the mediation layer works well enough to make yo=
ur expertise visible through it.
The strategic choice is whether you=E2=80=99ll structure your expertise for=
 this new reality while most people are still optimizing purely for traditi=
onal search=E2=80=94establishing algorithmic authority that compounds throu=
gh citation patterns=E2=80=94or whether you=E2=80=99ll wait until it=E2=80=
=99s baseline and you=E2=80=99re catching up rather than leading.
The open web is dying in traffic terms. The open web is evolving in discove=
ry terms. Both are true. The organizations and individuals who can hold bot=
h truths and adapt accordingly will build visibility advantages that persis=
t even after the transition completes. The ones who pretend nothing=E2=80=
=99s changing, or who assume everything=E2=80=99s changing so dramatically =
that old principles don=E2=80=99t matter, will miss the window entirely.
You have maybe a year to figure this out and establish position. After that=
, we=E2=80=99re back to authority signals mattering=E2=80=94just measured t=
hrough citation rates and extraction quality rather than backlinks and traf=
fic. The fundamental game hasn=E2=80=99t disappeared. It=E2=80=99s just bei=
ng played on different infrastructure with different rules.
Good luck out there.

These seven prompts give you a complete system to go from invisible to cite=
d in AI responses. You start by testing your baseline visibility (Prompt 1)=
 and comparing it to competitors (Prompt 7) so you know where you stand and=
 how urgent this is. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Then you pick one specific concept yo=
u can own (Prompt 3), build an Atomic Claim Page for it using the exact str=
ucture AI systems prefer (Prompt 6), and fix any extraction problems before=
 you publish using the content audit (Prompt 2) and domain mismatch check (=
Prompt 5). </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">After that, you can mine your existing work for=
 gold nuggets (Prompt 4) and track whether your visibility improves over ti=
me by re-running Prompt 1 every few weeks. The payoff is your name appearin=
g when people ask AI systems about your expertise, cleaner attribution that=
 doesn=E2=80=99t get lost to your institution, and a reusable workflow you =
can scale to multiple concepts without diluting your authority. </p><p styl=

ilver bullet. They=E2=80=99re designed to give you structure, but remember =
that you=E2=80=99re writing for both human and LLM attention. These techniq=

=E2=80=94and organic click-through rates to publishers have dropped 15-25% =
year-over-year. Search query volume keeps growing (up 21.6% annually), but =

ship with it where AI acts as the glasses you put on to view the open web=
=E2=80=94a mediation layer between you and information. The content is stil=

 Agency testing found that over-optimization produces 50-80% visibility col=
