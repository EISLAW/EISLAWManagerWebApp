THE FUTURE OF HEZBOLLAH [3]
THE MILITANT GROUP WOULD PREFER MARTYRDOM OVER DISARMAMENT.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Last month, the Lebanese Cabinet approved a U.S. proposal calling on Beirut to impose state sovereignty over all Lebanese territory, demarcate the border with Israel and disarm Hezbollah. Under the
plan, Israel would then begin a gradual withdrawal from the positions it occupied in southern Lebanon last year. The Lebanese government subsequently announced its intention to disarm Hezbollah by the
end of 2025. The group, unsurprisingly, has rejected the plan. As Cabinet members met to discuss the issue of disarmament, Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem criticized Prime Minister Nawaf Salam
for his support of the U.S. proposal and urged the Cabinet not to waste time trying to implement U.S. dictates. This situation effectively means Hezbollah would have to confront the Lebanese army to
maintain control over its military infrastructure and weapons.
However, weakened by Israel’s offensive last year and continuous attacks on its commanders and military infrastructure, Hezbollah isn’t willing to start a fight with the Lebanese army, and vice
versa. But if it continues to refuse to disarm, it will invite an escalation of hostilities with Israel. Indeed, given the stalemate within Lebanon, Israel could be planning a renewed offensive
against Hezbollah beyond its current low-intensity war of attrition – which would have disastrous consequences for an already fractured Lebanon.
PRESSURE TO DISARM
U.S. envoy to Lebanon Tom Barrack presented the U.S. proposal to the Lebanese government as a way to ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities with Israel. It builds on the Taif Agreement, which ended
the Lebanese Civil War in 1989, and U.N. Security Council resolutions 1559 and 1701, which call for the Lebanese state’s total control of weapons and the end of armed militias in the country. U.S.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Beirut, stressed that the time has come to disarm Iranian-backed Hezbollah and transition it into a formal political party. He also said if Hezbollah refuses
to give up its weapons, then there will be no choice but to disarm it by force. Israel is prepared to do so, Graham insisted, noting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously
expressed willingness to assist Lebanon in eliminating Hezbollah’s military arsenal.
Hezbollah now faces a fateful choice. It still refuses to disarm but also wants to avoid confrontation with the army and being declared a banned entity. The army leadership also doesn’t want a
military confrontation with Hezbollah and a possible splintering of the army along sectarian lines, as occurred in 1976 and 1984. Hezbollah has reneged on its approval of a ministerial statement
issued last February that stipulated the state’s monopoly on arms, as well as its parliamentary deputies’ granting of a vote of confidence for the government on that basis. Its defiance was
boosted by the Iranian foreign minister’s visit to Beirut, during which he stated that efforts to disarm Hezbollah would fail and Tehran would continue to support the group’s resistance.
The Lebanese government’s decision to, albeit reluctantly, task the army with developing a plan to remove the group’s weapons (including precision missiles, drones, surface-to-air missiles,
mortars, and even hand grenades and explosives) was an unprecedented step, given the country’s sectarian and ideological divides. Its significance is that it shifts the Hezbollah issue from a
Lebanese-Israeli conflict to an intra-Lebanese one. Hezbollah can disrupt the functioning of the accommodationist Lebanese political system by withdrawing its ministers from the Cabinet and deputies
from parliament. Such a move would not relieve it from the pressure to disarm, but it would accelerate the resumption of war with Israel.
Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem has already threatened to renew the military confrontation with Israel. Neither Israel nor Lebanon takes the threat seriously, considering that Israel has been launching
strikes against Hezbollah at will daily. Hezbollah is attempting to buy time by suggesting dialogue with the government, hoping regional developments (or divine intervention) will divert international
attention to more pressing matters.
The Lebanese army is now in a difficult position, as it is not inclined to use military force against a fundamental component of Lebanese society. Israel will thus likely resume its war against
Hezbollah. The U.S. proposal emphasized that the Lebanese government’s failure to comply would lead to its international isolation, its denial of foreign support and withholding of reconstruction
aid. It would also lead to an escalation of Israeli airstrikes.
MARTYRDOM OVER DISARMAMENT
For doctrinal reasons, Hezbollah would rather resist and risk its own destruction than agree to disarm. The head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raad, compared the fight ahead to the
Battle of Karbala, which took place in 680 between Hussein bin Ali, the second imam of Shiite belief, and the Umayyad army, in which Hussein and his 72 followers lost their lives. The contest has
become a symbol of revolt against injustice among Shiites and has catalyzed Shiite political movements ever since. Hezbollah, which views itself as the guardian of the Shiite faith, considers jihad
the path to martyrdom and urges its fighters to cherish martyrdom as a gateway to heaven. While most who go to war are motivated by the spirit of survival and a desire to return home safely, Hezbollah
fighters go to battle with an eagerness to become martyrs in defense of their honor, dignity and religion.
The concept of martyrdom, characterized by rebellion against the regime, holds a central place in Shiite doctrine. Many of the historical events that Shiites commemorate occurred just after the dawn
of Islam and relate to the acquisition of authority and governance within the community of believers. Many of these struggles failed, and the men who led them lost their lives, further contributing to
the legacy of martyrdom.
CONSEQUENCES FOR LEBANON
If Hezbollah does not willfully surrender its weapons and abandon its military project, Lebanon will become marginalized in the region and lose all foreign support. Following the elimination of most
of Hezbollah’s leadership and the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington believes a unique opportunity has arisen to reshape the landscape in Lebanon and marginalize Hezbollah. It is
unlikely that the Trump administration will agree to allow Israel to launch a comprehensive war against Hezbollah, which Netanyahu may not want anyway, given his preoccupation with Gaza, the West Bank
and Syria. However, Israel can continue its daily targeting of Hezbollah personnel and increase pressure on it by launching surgical commando operations in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah strongholds
in the southern suburbs of Beirut and the east of the country. Increased Israeli military pressure will crack Hezbollah’s popular base, and many of its members will eventually give up their weapons.
Barrack recently indicated that financial compensation would be offered to Hezbollah fighters who lay down their weapons, suggesting the existence of a plan to systematically target Hezbollah’s
remaining assets, with the army eventually filling the vacuum left by the group’s collapse.
[Lebanon's Religious Demographics] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
Should another round of fighting break out, Israel will demand additional security arrangements, likely including making all of southern Lebanon a demilitarized zone, thus effectively ending
Hezbollah’s presence in the area. Meanwhile, meetings are underway between Syria and Israel under the auspices of the U.S. and Gulf countries (namely, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) on a
security agreement between the two archrivals. One possible arrangement would see Syria annex the Lebanese coastal city of Tripoli and northern region of Akkar in exchange for relinquishing its claims
over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. For Damascus, Tripoli’s importance lies in the fact that the administration of President Ahmad al-Sharaa has been unable to consolidate its control over the
Syrian coast, where Alawites constitute the majority. The Syrian government’s access to the ports of Latakia and Tartus is therefore questionable, hence its interest in Tripoli, which has a Sunni
majority. (During the Ottoman era, Tripoli was the capital of a province that included the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama.)
The Syrian government has not denied leaks in the media about al-Sharaa’s desire to swap parts of northern Lebanon for the Golan Heights. Al-Sharaa would like to resettle many of the 2 million
Syrians who fled to Lebanon during the Syrian civil war there, which would pave the way for demographic changes in Lebanon. Even though the Syrian government insists that it has no intention of
clashing with Hezbollah, Hezbollah’s eradication as a fighting force would likely tempt the Syrians to move into eastern and northern Lebanon and reclaim a large swath of Lebanese territory. Barrack
has said that, if Lebanon does not address its internal problems, it could once again become part of Greater Syria. More than a century after France’s High Commissioner of the Levant declared the
creation of Greater Lebanon, the precursor to modern-day Lebanon, it’s clear that the project has failed. Maronite Christians might today prefer to abandon this endeavor in favor of an all-Christian
Mount Lebanon ministate.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last month, the Le=
banese Cabinet approved a U.S. proposal calling on Beirut to impose state s=
overeignty over all Lebanese territory, demarcate the border with Israel an=
d disarm Hezbollah. Under the plan, Israel would then begin a gradual withd=
rawal from the positions it occupied in southern Lebanon last year. The Leb=
anese government subsequently announced its intention to disarm Hezbollah b=
y the end of 2025. The group, unsurprisingly, has rejected the plan. As Cab=
inet members met to discuss the issue of disarmament, Hezbollah Secretary-G=
eneral Naim Qassem criticized Prime Minister Nawaf Salam for his support of=
 the U.S. proposal and urged the Cabinet not to waste time trying to implem=
ent U.S. dictates. This situation effectively means Hezbollah would have to=
 confront the Lebanese army to maintain control over its military infrastru=
cture and weapons.</p>

nders and military infrastructure, Hezbollah isn=E2=80=99t willing to start=
 a fight with the Lebanese army, and vice versa. But if it continues to ref=
use to disarm, it will invite an escalation of hostilities with Israel. Ind=
eed, given the stalemate within Lebanon, Israel could be planning a renewed=
 offensive against Hezbollah beyond its current low-intensity war of attrit=
ion =E2=80=93 which would have disastrous consequences for an already fract=
ured Lebanon.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Pressure t=
o Disarm</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">U.S. envoy to Leba=
non Tom Barrack presented the U.S. proposal to the Lebanese government as a=
 way to ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities with Israel. It builds on=
 the Taif Agreement, which ended the Lebanese Civil War in 1989, and U.N. S=
ecurity Council resolutions 1559 and 1701, which call for the Lebanese stat=
e=E2=80=99s total control of weapons and the end of armed militias in the c=
ountry. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Beirut, stressed tha=
t the time has come to disarm Iranian-backed Hezbollah and transition it in=
to a formal political party. He also said if Hezbollah refuses to give up i=
ts weapons, then there will be no choice but to disarm it by force. Israel =
is prepared to do so, Graham insisted, noting that Israeli Prime Minister B=
enjamin Netanyahu has previously expressed willingness to assist Lebanon in=
 eliminating Hezbollah=E2=80=99s military arsenal.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah now face=
s a fateful choice. It still refuses to disarm but also wants to avoid conf=
rontation with the army and being declared a banned entity. The army leader=
ship also doesn=E2=80=99t want a military confrontation with Hezbollah and =
a possible splintering of the army along sectarian lines, as occurred in 19=
76 and 1984. Hezbollah has reneged on its approval of a ministerial stateme=
nt issued last February that stipulated the state=E2=80=99s monopoly on arm=
s, as well as its parliamentary deputies=E2=80=99 granting of a vote of con=
fidence for the government on that basis. Its defiance was boosted by the I=
ranian foreign minister=E2=80=99s visit to Beirut, during which he stated t=
hat efforts to disarm Hezbollah would fail and Tehran would continue to sup=
port the group=E2=80=99s resistance.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Lebanese gover=
nment=E2=80=99s decision to, albeit reluctantly, task the army with develop=
ing a plan to remove the group=E2=80=99s weapons (including precision missi=
les, drones, surface-to-air missiles, mortars, and even hand grenades and e=
xplosives) was an unprecedented step, given the country=E2=80=99s sectarian=
 and ideological divides. Its significance is that it shifts the Hezbollah =
issue from a Lebanese-Israeli conflict to an intra-Lebanese one. Hezbollah =
can disrupt the functioning of the accommodationist Lebanese political syst=
em by withdrawing its ministers from the Cabinet and deputies from parliame=
nt. Such a move would not relieve it from the pressure to disarm, but it wo=
uld accelerate the resumption of war with Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Hezbollah leader N=
aim Qassem has already threatened to renew the military confrontation with =
Israel. Neither Israel nor Lebanon takes the threat seriously, considering =
that Israel has been launching strikes against Hezbollah at will daily. Hez=
bollah is attempting to buy time by suggesting dialogue with the government=
, hoping regional developments (or divine intervention) will divert interna=
tional attention to more pressing matters.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Lebanese army =
is now in a difficult position, as it is not inclined to use military force=
 against a fundamental component of Lebanese society. Israel will thus like=
ly resume its war against Hezbollah. The U.S. proposal emphasized that the =
Lebanese government=E2=80=99s failure to comply would lead to its internati=
onal isolation, its denial of foreign support and withholding of reconstruc=
tion aid. It would also lead to an escalation of Israeli airstrikes.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Martyrdom =
Over Disarmament</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For doctrinal reas=
ons, Hezbollah would rather resist and risk its own destruction than agree =
to disarm. The head of Hezbollah=E2=80=99s parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raa=
d, compared the fight ahead to the Battle of Karbala, which took place in 6=
80 between Hussein bin Ali, the second imam of Shiite belief, and the Umayy=
ad army, in which Hussein and his 72 followers lost their lives. The contes=
t has become a symbol of revolt against injustice among Shiites and has cat=
alyzed Shiite political movements ever since. Hezbollah, which views itself=
 as the guardian of the Shiite faith, considers jihad the path to martyrdom=
 and urges its fighters to cherish martyrdom as a gateway to heaven. While =
most who go to war are motivated by the spirit of survival and a desire to =
return home safely, Hezbollah fighters go to battle with an eagerness to be=
come martyrs in defense of their honor, dignity and religion.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The concept of mar=
tyrdom, characterized by rebellion against the regime, holds a central plac=
e in Shiite doctrine. Many of the historical events that Shiites commemorat=
e occurred just after the dawn of Islam and relate to the acquisition of au=
thority and governance within the community of believers. Many of these str=
uggles failed, and the men who led them lost their lives, further contribut=
ing to the legacy of martyrdom.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Consequenc=
es for Lebanon</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">If Hezbollah does =
not willfully surrender its weapons and abandon its military project, Leban=
on will become marginalized in the region and lose all foreign support. Fol=
lowing the elimination of most of Hezbollah=E2=80=99s leadership and the bo=
mbing of Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington believes a unique opportuni=
ty has arisen to reshape the landscape in Lebanon and marginalize Hezbollah=
. It is unlikely that the Trump administration will agree to allow Israel t=
o launch a comprehensive war against Hezbollah, which Netanyahu may not wan=
t anyway, given his preoccupation with Gaza, the West Bank and Syria. Howev=
er, Israel can continue its daily targeting of Hezbollah personnel and incr=
ease pressure on it by launching surgical commando operations in southern L=
ebanon and Hezbollah strongholds in the southern suburbs of Beirut and the =
east of the country. Increased Israeli military pressure will crack Hezboll=
ah=E2=80=99s popular base, and many of its members will eventually give up =
their weapons. Barrack recently indicated that financial compensation would=
 be offered to Hezbollah fighters who lay down their weapons, suggesting th=
e existence of a plan to systematically target Hezbollah=E2=80=99s remainin=
g assets, with the army eventually filling the vacuum left by the group=E2=
=80=99s collapse.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Should another rou=
nd of fighting break out, Israel will demand additional security arrangemen=
ts, likely including making all of southern Lebanon a demilitarized zone, t=
hus effectively ending Hezbollah=E2=80=99s presence in the area. Meanwhile,=
 meetings are underway between Syria and Israel under the auspices of the U=
.S. and Gulf countries (namely, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) =
on a security agreement between the two archrivals. One possible arrangemen=
t would see Syria annex the Lebanese coastal city of Tripoli and northern r=
egion of Akkar in exchange for relinquishing its claims over the Israeli-oc=
cupied Golan Heights. For Damascus, Tripoli=E2=80=99s importance lies in th=
e fact that the administration of President Ahmad al-Sharaa has been unable=
 to consolidate its control over the Syrian coast, where Alawites constitut=
e the majority. The Syrian government=E2=80=99s access to the ports of Lata=
kia and Tartus is therefore questionable, hence its interest in Tripoli, wh=
ich has a Sunni majority. (During the Ottoman era, Tripoli was the capital =
of a province that included the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Syrian governm=
ent has not denied leaks in the media about al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s desire to s=
wap parts of northern Lebanon for the Golan Heights. Al-Sharaa would like t=
o resettle many of the 2 million Syrians who fled to Lebanon during the Syr=
ian civil war there, which would pave the way for demographic changes in Le=
banon. Even though the Syrian government insists that it has no intention o=
f clashing with Hezbollah, Hezbollah=E2=80=99s eradication as a fighting fo=
rce would likely tempt the Syrians to move into eastern and northern Lebano=
n and reclaim a large swath of Lebanese territory. Barrack has said that, i=
f Lebanon does not address its internal problems, it could once again becom=
e part of Greater Syria. More than a century after France=E2=80=99s High Co=
mmissioner of the Levant declared the creation of Greater Lebanon, the prec=
ursor to modern-day Lebanon, it=E2=80=99s clear that the project has failed=
. Maronite Christians might today prefer to abandon this endeavor in favor =
of an all-Christian Mount Lebanon ministate.</p>
