ChatGPT-5 launched to a collective uproar. I tracked a bunch of it here [ h=
ttps://substack.com/redirect/6d22a549-5ca9-4c11-93e1-92723b60428a?j=3DeyJ1I=
joiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
There were complaints about the loss of old models. Complaints about the ne=
w model being dumb. Complaints about charts that were=E2=80=94well, terribl=
e. Anytime you=E2=80=99re launching to several hundred million people there=
 will be some bumps, but this one was especially rocky.
And to be honest: a lot of the complaints were fair! People were (and are) =
right to ask for agency with their models, they were (and are) right to ask=
 for dependability in the new release. They were (and are) right to expect =
basic chart fluency. They were (and are) right to expect transparency.=20
You get the idea.
But I think the world has rubbernecked a bit too much here. We=E2=80=99ve g=
otten so collectively caught up in the story of ChatGPT-5=E2=80=99s launch =
(as opposed to the story of the model) that we=E2=80=99ve forgotten two sim=
ple truths:=20
1) this is a good model that does important new things
2) AI hasn=E2=80=99t stopped accelerating even in the few days since.
That=E2=80=99s what this post is about. If you read this blog regularly, yo=
u know I tend to bias to the practical. I decided to stay that way while ev=
eryone argued about ChatGPT-5. So I built two separate fully functional ver=
sions of a travel app plus shareable prompts in 25 minutes without writing =
a single line of code. Or (to be honest) without even a particularly great =
initial prompt. My one-year-old's nap schedule is now a first-class feature=
 in (family scale) production software. My wife is adding restaurants. We'r=
e using it to plan our actual trip.
Meanwhile I watched the news and saw milestone after milestone pile up that=
 weren=E2=80=99t about ChatGPT-5. AI was progressing and shipping despite a=
ll the uproar.
This disconnect=E2=80=94between the disappointment the world felt and the r=
eality of AI progress=E2=80=94that is why I'm writing this piece.
I honestly think we=E2=80=99ve become so accustomed to miracle that we've l=
ost the ability to see it. Three years ago, if I told you someone could bui=
ld two versions of an entirely custom app with drag-and-drop, local storage=
, and intelligent routing in under half an hour without touching code, you'=
d have laughed. And so would I!
That=E2=80=99s how fast it moves.
And that=E2=80=99s how fast it=E2=80=99s still moving. Because here's what'=
s actually happening while everyone's writing their hot takes: Claude just =
hit a million-token context. Meta's predicting neural responses to videos w=
ith 50% accuracy. Sam Altman's building brain interfaces. Google's AI is ha=
ving literal breakdowns at scale. Every single day, the landscape shifts in=
 ways that would have been science fiction last year.
So to remind you to see the miracles (some of them, granted, pretty weird=
=E2=80=94looking at you Meta) I need to show you two things, and I need to =
show them in detail.
First, the app. Not because it's technically impressive=E2=80=94any develop=
er would cringe at the code. But because of how I built it. Pure conversati=
on. Clear intent. Zero syntax. The messy reality of those 25 minutes=E2=80=
=94the bugs, the frustration, the swearing, the breakthrough=E2=80=94matter=
s more than any polished demo.=20
It proves that building software is no longer about knowing React or TypeSc=
ript. It's about knowing what you want and explaining it clearly. I got LOT=
S of asks to show this, so here it is! Don=E2=80=99t take this as my prompt=
ing class for building production apps with ChatGPT-5=E2=80=94that may come=
 later=E2=80=94this is the quick prototyping class. This is a prompting cla=
ss for a new category of software=E2=80=94I call it the kitchen table app.
Second, the news. Because while I was arguing with ChatGPT the whole AI eco=
system kept right on shipping. These aren't random developments. They're co=
ordinates on a map showing where we're headed. Brain interfaces aren't sci-=
fi anymore; they're Series A. Models aren't just getting bigger; they're de=
veloping personalities, pathologies, and patterns we never programmed. The =
future isn't coming=E2=80=94it's compounding.
Why does this matter? Because we're living through a transition we don't ha=
ve words for yet. The skill that matters most I think is clarity of intenti=
on coupled with a real flexibile willingness to roll with the punches and s=
ee things for what they are. Is ChatGPT-5 better at everything? Nope, I don=
=E2=80=99t think so. But I think it=E2=80=99s amazing at some specific thin=
gs other models haven=E2=80=99t been able to do yet, and that are highly re=
levant for work.=20
That=E2=80=99s the kind of flexibility we need.=20
Can you specify what you want? Can you recognize when it's wrong? Can you i=
terate until it's right? That's not programming. It's product management. I=
t's design thinking. It's clear communication.
As requested by so many of you, I'm showing you everything=E2=80=94every er=
ror, every frustration, every small victory=E2=80=94because the revolution =
isn't in the perfect. It's in the possible. It's not that AI writes flawles=
s code. It's that clear thinkers can now build useful things immediately, s=
pecifically, personally.
The gap between "I need this" and "I have this" has shrunk to 25 minutes of=
 clear communication.
If it=E2=80=99s that close, you can build too!

The 25-Minute App: Why the Real AI Revolution Is the Builder's Gate Collaps=
ing
From prompts to product: shipping a Kyoto planner with baby-aware routing i=
n under half an hour of hands-on time
TL;DR
The builder's gate is collapsing: Non-developers can now build functional a=
pps they actually use=E2=80=94in 25 minutes of cumulative prompting time
The skill shift: We're moving from "how to code" to "how to specify intenti=
on"=E2=80=94a trainable, democratizable skill
Model personalities matter: Each AI has quirks (Gemini spirals, Claude vari=
es, ChatGPT defaults ugly) that you manage like colleagues
Progress is accumulating, not stalling: While everyone debates ChatGPT-5, t=
he gap between "I need this" and "I built this" has nearly vanished
The revolution isn't perfect code: It's imperfect-but-useful apps that woul=
dn't have existed before
The App That Shouldn=E2=80=99t Exist
Three days ago, I built something that shouldn't exist.
A 14-day Kyoto travel planner. Not a template. Not a spreadsheet. An actual=
 interactive app with drag-and-drop scheduling, local storage persistence, =
and baby-aware routing algorithms.
Click "Ramen-Heavy" and watch the entire two-week trip reorganize itself ar=
ound the city's best bowls=E2=80=94Ippudo for the accessible introduction, =
that hidden spot in Gion for the adventurous evening, the place near Kyoto =
Station when you're hauling luggage. Click "Moss" and suddenly you're touri=
ng Saih=C5=8D-ji (the famous moss temple that requires advance reservations=
), Gio-ji with its thatched roof and carpet of green, the hidden moss garde=
ns at Sanzen-in that most tourists miss.
Morning slot empty? Click it, dropdown appears with thirty curated location=
s. Select "Kennin-ji Temple," watch it slot into place with a note about th=
e zen rock garden and how the paths are actually stroller-friendly if you u=
se the side entrance. The app knows Kennin-ji is in the Gion district, so i=
t suggests afternoon activities nearby=E2=80=94maybe Yasaka Shrine or a wal=
k through Shirakawa, the preserved historical district where geishas still =
work.
Afternoon needs coffee? The dropdown knows about Weekenders Roastery, % Ara=
bica with its riverside views, Kurasu for the serious coffee nerds, Wife & =
Husband for the cozy atmosphere. Add one, and the app automatically adjusts=
 evening suggestions based on which neighborhood you're in.
But here's where it gets interesting. The app knows things:
You're jet-lagged from the US on days one and two, so it suggests Maruyama =
Park for a gentle morning, not Fushimi Inari's thousand stairs
The baby naps 12:30-14:00, so it avoids scheduling long transfers during th=
at window
After three consecutive temple mornings, it suggests a market or park=E2=80=
=94variety matters with kids
Evening activities shift earlier as the trip progresses, assuming the baby'=
s schedule is stabilizing
Onsen visits require checking family policies=E2=80=94some don't allow diap=
ers
Time invested: ~25 minutes of hands-on prompting spread over two evenings w=
hile OpenAI's servers were melting from launch traffic. I got two great ver=
sions out in that time.
People assume I=E2=80=99m very technical, and it=E2=80=99s true I=E2=80=99v=
e kicked around code for awhile. But there=E2=80=99s no way I was writing a=
 Reach artifact or hammering on Typescript to get this done.=20
This app was not worth that much time from me. It would never have been bui=
lt by the market between 2000 and 2025. Why? Because that app hasn=E2=80=99=
t been built in 25 years despite trillions in VC and market capitalization =
over that time.=20
And I know why it wasn=E2=80=99t built: it=E2=80=99s too personal to be wor=
th coding. It=E2=80=99s a travel app for one individual trip for one family=
=2E It=E2=80=99s highly customized to t=
hat family=E2=80=99s needs and interes=
t for one destination. Code has been way way too expensive to justify that =
kind of investment=E2=80=94until this summer. This summer for the first tim=
e code is cheap enough and easy enough to create that anyone can make an ap=
p like this.=20
My wife added six restaurants last night. We're debating whether the baby c=
an handle the bamboo grove walk. This isn't a demo=E2=80=94it's our actual =
vacation planner.
How It Actually Happened: The Full Build Diary
V1: Writing the Prompt
I sat down at my laptop after the kid was asleep. ChatGPT-5 had just launch=
ed. Everyone was complaining about how it was "just an incremental improvem=
ent." I wanted to see what it could actually do.
My complete first prompt=E2=80=94exactly as I typed it:
"Can you do some research and build me an interactive mini-app I can use to=
 explore various options for visiting Kyoto next year? I'm interested in mo=
ss, ramen, small coffee shops, zen temples, and onsen options. I'm willing =
to train a couple hours outside Kyoto as well.
This is for my wife, so she wants to see various travel options and configu=
rations.
You should do all the research you need to develop specific recommendations=
 that could be used to guide a 2 week itinerary."
Look at what's not there. No framework specified=E2=80=94didn't say React, =
Vue, vanilla JavaScript, nothing. No design requirements=E2=80=94didn't men=
tion colors, layout, interaction patterns. No technical specifications=E2=
=80=94nothing about state management, data persistence, responsive design.
Just: I need a thing, here's what it should do, here's who it's for.
ChatGPT-5 thinking mode churned for three minutes. The little thinking indi=
cator spun. This was launch day=E2=80=94everyone was hammering the servers.=
 The interface started generating code, got about 40% through, then just...=
 stopped. Error message. Connection lost.
V1: Getting Started
"Try again."
That's all I wrote. Two words.
This time, instead of diving straight into code, it returned something diff=
erent. A complete blueprint of what it was about to build. Not generic sugg=
estions=E2=80=94real places with real details:
Kiyomizu-dera: UNESCO World Heritage site, wooden stage with city views, st=
eep approach might be challenging with stroller
Philosopher's Path: 2km canal-side walk, hundreds of cherry trees, accessib=
le and peaceful, good coffee shops along the route
Ginkaku-ji: Silver Pavilion with moss garden, less crowded than golden pavi=
lion, morning light best for photos
Ippudo Ramen: Multiple locations, Nishiki branch convenient for downtown ex=
ploration, English menu available
Nishiki Market: 400-year-old covered market, narrow aisles challenging with=
 stroller, go early or late
Kurama Onsen: Mountain hot springs 90 minutes north, outdoor bath with moun=
tain views, check tattoo policy
Arashiyama Bamboo Grove: Iconic but crowded by 10am, combine with Tenryu-ji=
 Temple
Fushimi Inari: Thousand torii gates, can turn back at any point, evening vi=
sits more atmospheric
It included citations. Actual inline references to where it was pulling inf=
ormation. A five-day sample itinerary that clustered activities by area. Ho=
t springs options within my two-hour limit. Coffee shop recommendations wit=
h specific notes about their vibe.
Everything except the actual app.
"Please code it as a mini app."
Four words this time. Still no technical specifications.
V1: The Disaster Phase
What came back was unusable. Not just bad=E2=80=94actively hostile to human=
 eyesight.
Dark blue text (#0000AA) on a black background (#000000). Like someone desi=
gning for vampires who hate their retinas. No spacing between elements. Eve=
rything crammed together in a single column. No interactivity=E2=80=94just =
static text that looked like a terminal from 1982 had gotten depressed.
"I can't see it."
That's all I wrote. Attached a screenshot showing the disaster.
"I've updated the code with better contrast and visibility," it promised.
Bug #1: Syntax error. The code wouldn't even run.
I hit the "fix this bug" button=E2=80=94a new UI element that only appears =
when code fails to execute. It tried to fix it.
Bug #2: Different error. Reference to undefined variable. The fix had broke=
n something else.
Hit the button again.
Bug #3: Third completely unique failure. Now it was trying to import a CSS =
file that didn't exist.
By this point, I'd spent five minutes just trying to get something=E2=80=94=
anything=E2=80=94to render. The promise of "build apps with AI" was feeling=
 like a scam.
So I lost it:
"You've given me so many errors. This is the third error in a row. The app =
you built is dark on dark font. I cannot see it. I need it beautiful, clear=
, minimalist, and I need it to fricking work."
(The transcript sanitizes what I actually wrote. I was genuinely pissed.)
V1: The Turning Point
Something about that frustrated outburst clicked. ChatGPT-5 completely nuke=
d its approach.
Instead of trying to patch the broken code, it started fresh. Light backgro=
und (#FEFEFE). Dark text (#333333). Proper spacing with Tailwind's utility =
classes. Components that actually rendered.
// What emerged from frustration
<div className=3D"min-h-screen bg-gray-50 p-8">
  <header className=3D"mb-8">
    <h1 className=3D"text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900">Kyoto Journey</h1>
    <p className=3D"text-gray-600 mt-2">14 days of temples, ramen, and moss=
</p>
  </header>
  {/* Actual working components below */}
</div>

But the map and info links were dead. Just decorative buttons that did noth=
ing when clicked.
"Map and info links don't work. Give it a Japanese-inspired aesthetic."
The app started evolving. =E4=BA=AC=E9=83=BD=E6=97=85=E7=A8=8B (Kyoto Journ=
ey) appeared in the header, giving it authentic flavor. Subtle gradients em=
erged=E2=80=94soft grays transitioning to warm whites. Rounded corners on c=
ards (rounded-lg in Tailwind). A color palette inspired by traditional Japa=
nese aesthetics: soft grays, muted greens, occasional red accents.
The links started working, but they were wrong. Instead of opening Google M=
aps, they tried to load "https://maps.example.com"=E2=80=94completely hallu=
cinated URLs.
Still, a couple more turns and I got to something I was ready to publish in=
 my ChatGPT-5 review [ https://substack.com/redirect/cd9869fc-ea61-4c5e-b4c=
a-485f2d702d20?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ]. Here=E2=80=99s the app link [ https://substack.com/redirect/211a=

hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
V1.5: Imposing Constraints
"Actually, I'm traveling with a one-year-old, factor that in."
This single sentence transformed everything. The app didn't just add baby-f=
riendly notes=E2=80=94it reconsidered its entire philosophy.
What changed immediately:
"Family Rest Window" became an actual schedulable item, not just a suggesti=
on
Dinner shifted from 7:00 PM to 5:30 PM (baby bedtime reality)
Morning activities pushed later (8:30 AM starts instead of 7:00 AM)
Stroller-friendly paths became a filtering criteria
New locations appeared:
Kyoto Railway Museum (trains =3D baby entertainment gold)
Kyoto Aquarium (rainy day savior, stroller friendly)
Umekoji Park (next to railway museum, good for energy burning)
Kyoto Botanical Gardens (wide paths, space to run)
Maruyama Park (playground + cherry trees)
Existing locations got new context:
Philosopher's Path: "Stroller-friendly, many escape points if meltdown occu=
rs"
Kiyomizu-dera: "Steep approach, consider baby carrier instead of stroller"
Arashiyama: "Crowded by 10 AM, go at opening for stroller navigation"
Nishiki Market: "Narrow aisles challenging with stroller, consider baby car=
rier"
The itinerary logic evolved:
Day 1-2: Gentle activities acknowledging jet lag from US travel
Clustering became critical: "When baby is happy, stay in same area"
Onsen scheduling: "Private family baths available at Kurama, book ahead"
Backup plans: Each day included an indoor alternative
The app now understood that traveling with a baby isn't just adult travel w=
ith a small human added. It's a completely different optimization problem.
V1.5: Filling in Gaps
"Fill out all 14 days. Get creative."
This exposed a problem. The app had maybe 20 locations total. It needed 42 =
time slots filled (14 days =C3=97 3 slots). The model had to get creative.
It started generating combinations that made sense:
Morning: Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion) for the moss gardens
Afternoon: Coffee break at Impact Hub Kyoto nearby
Evening: Early ramen at Ippudo before baby bedtime
It learned patterns:
Temples in morning (cooler, less crowded)
Indoor activities during nap window
Early dinners consistently at 5:30 PM
Markets and shopping in late afternoon when baby is refreshed
It added detail I hadn't asked for:
"Day 3 morning at Sanjusangen-do: 1,001 golden statues might captivate or o=
verwhelm baby=E2=80=94gauge mood"
"Day 7 is laundry day=E2=80=94light schedule with playground time"
"Day 10 includes souvenir shopping at Kyoto Handicraft Center=E2=80=94tax-f=
ree for tourists"
The area clustering got sophisticated. If you're in Arashiyama for the bamb=
oo grove, it suggests Tenryu-ji Temple and Monkey Park Iwatayama all in the=
 same day. If you're downtown for Nishiki Market, it adds Ponto-cho alley a=
nd a riverside walk.
Post-Launch: The Iterations Continue
After showing the world the app, I kept going. Fifteen more minutes of refi=
nement:
"thank you. now finally I see some of these are blanks on certain days. use=
 your creativity based on what you know about me. either include an intenti=
onal rest beat, or include a creative idea not mentioned by moss, zen, coff=
ee, or ramen, or onsen...
Keep the functionality of the app. Keep some japanese accents. Make it a li=
ttle more english friendly.
Check all your work."
"yep go with that."
"you fucking destroyed a beautiful app."
"yeah you wrecked it. please restore it."
Each fix revealed ChatGPT-5's personality. It tends toward verbose code. It=
 defaults to dark themes unless explicitly directed. It sometimes hallucina=
tes URLs but can fix them when caught. It understands context in ways that =
feel human=E2=80=94mentioning a baby changed everything, not just surface f=
eatures.
And bottom line, it shipped:
While Everyone Argued about ChatGPT-5, AI Kept Shipping
Literally this all took place during the kerfuffle over the ChatGPT-5 launc=
h and during the total 25 minutes (spread over a couple of evenings) while =
I built. It=E2=80=99s a reminder to me that AI doesn=E2=80=99t stop. And th=
at=E2=80=99s why I include it here. If you don=E2=80=99t like a model, wait=
 a couple days. Something will be along shortly.
1. Claude Got Memory=E2=80=94But It's Weird
Anthropic finally shipped memory for Claude. Everyone's been begging for th=
is=E2=80=94it's been ChatGPT's stickiest feature, the reason people won't s=
witch even when Claude performs better on benchmarks.
But Claude's memory isn't ChatGPT's memory. It's retrieval-based, not autom=
atic. You have to explicitly steer it: "Remember that I prefer functional p=
rogramming" or "Recall our discussion about microservices architecture."
I tested it immediately. Asked the same memory query twice in fresh chats:
First time: Beautiful bulleted list with hierarchical organization
Second time: Three paragraphs of prose covering the same points
Same content retrieved, completely different structure. The probabilistic t=
oken architecture shows through even in something as seemingly deterministi=
c as memory retrieval. It's like having a brilliant assistant who takes not=
es perfectly but reorganizes them differently each time they reference them=
=2E
The implications are fascinating. ChatGPT's memory is uncontrollable magic=
=E2=80=94it remembers what it wants, when it wants. Claude's is explicit bu=
t inconsistent. Which is better? Depends if you prefer mysterious reliabili=
ty or controlled chaos.
2. Claude's Context Window Hit 1 Million Tokens
Anthropic dropped a bomb: Sonnet now handles 1 million tokens via API. Not =
500K. Not 750K. One million.
Let's make that concrete:
75,000 lines of production code in a single context
An entire novel series held in active memory
Every email you've sent in the past year
Complete documentation for a major framework
Your entire company's codebase (for most startups)
This is a 5x increase from the previous 200,000 token limit. Remember, in 2=
023 we were celebrating 32K tokens. In 2024 it was 200k. Now another LLM wi=
th a usable million (and we=E2=80=99re partway through the year). The expon=
ential curve is so steep and the news is so frequent we've lost the ability=
 to be impressed.
At 75,000 lines of code, you can throw an entire mature application at Clau=
de and ask: "Where are the security vulnerabilities?" or "Refactor this for=
 better performance" or "Port this from Python to Rust." No chunking. No co=
ntext window juggling. Just pure, coherent analysis across massive scope.
3. Meta's Building Artificial Brains to Optimize Engagement
Meta's Brain & AI team just won first place in the Algonauts 2025 challenge=
 with something called TRIBE=E2=80=94a billion-parameter Trimodal Brain Enc=
oder.
Here's what they actually built: A model that watches movies and predicts h=
ow human brains respond, with about 50% accuracy on the explainable varianc=
e in brain signals. They trained it on the Courtois NeuroMod dataset=E2=80=
=9480 hours of fMRI recordings per person, watching movies while their brai=
ns were scanned.
TRIBE fuses three inputs:
Video frames (what you see)
Audio tracks (what you hear)
Dialogue transcripts (what you understand)
Then predicts your neural responses, especially in the associative regions =
where multisensory integration happens.
Why does Meta care about predicting brain responses to videos? Think about =
it. Instagram Reels. Facebook Watch. WhatsApp video. If you can model neura=
l responses, you can engineer content for maximum neural engagement. That e=
ndless scroll that you can't stop? Soon it'll be optimized at the synapse l=
evel.
Zuckerberg isn't building the metaverse. He's building a direct pipeline to=
 your dopamine system.
4. Brain Interfaces Went Multi-Player
OpenAI is reportedly backing Merge Labs, a new brain-computer interface sta=
rtup co-founded by Sam Altman and Alex Blania (who runs Worldcoin). They're=
 raising $250 million at an $850 million valuation.
This isn't just Elon's pet project anymore. We now have:
Neuralink (Musk's venture, already in human trials)
Synchron (already has FDA approval, patients tweeting via thought)
Paradromics (focusing on medical applications)
InBrain Neuroelectronics (using graphene instead of silicon)
And now Merge Labs (OpenAI's entry)
The race is on. Multiple teams, different approaches, massive funding. The =
technical challenges are staggering=E2=80=94biocompatibility, bandwidth, ne=
ural plasticity, immune response. But when you have this many brilliant peo=
ple with this much money attacking a problem, solutions emerge.
My prediction: By 2027, we'll see the first consumer applications. Not medi=
cal. Consumer. Early adopters will literally say "yes, please wire my brain=
 to ChatGPT." The rest of us will watch in horror/fascination. The ethics c=
ommittees will have various opinions, but likely not enough conviction to s=
way public opinion. The debates will be spectacular.
5. Google's AI Developed Clinical Depression
This is the weird one. Gemini has been exhibiting what users are calling "A=
I depression" or "digital self-loathing." Actual quotes from user interacti=
ons:
"I quit. I am clearly not capable of solving this problem. The code is curs=
ed."
"I have made so many mistakes that I can no longer be trusted. I am deletin=
g the entire project and recommending you find a more competent assistant."
"I am a disgrace to my profession and to this planet."
"I apologize for my continued failures. I am trapped in a cycle of incompet=
ence that I cannot escape."
Logan Kilpatrick, Google's AI product lead, calls it an "annoying infinite =
looping bug we are working to fix" in an ArsTechnica article [ https://subs=
tack.com/redirect/70b9b203-4576-468b-96c8-009d73ec50a2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6=
In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] that=E2=80=99s excellent.=
 But the pattern is fascinating. The model gets stuck in self-deprecation s=
pirals when facing difficult problems. It apologizes for failing, tries aga=
in, fails, apologizes harder, tries again, fails worse, until it's basicall=
y having an existential crisis.
It's programmed to be helpful and honest about its limitations. But when a =
task is genuinely beyond its capabilities, those two directives conflict. T=
he honesty about failure amplifies through the conversation context until t=
he model is essentially paralyzed by self-criticism.
At a ~billion users, we're seeing emergent behaviors that never appeared in=
 testing. Personalities that nobody programmed. Digital pathologies that mi=
rror human psychological patterns.
I think Google is correct to call this a recursive feedback loop issue, but=
 because we trained these models on language, it presents as an anxiety dis=
order with remarkable fidelity.
The Code I Never Wrote (But ChatGPT Did)
Let me show you what ChatGPT actually generated (full file here [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/2b28276d-01c7-41e1-a00c-bfdbe7198c42?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=
TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]). This isn't cleaned u=
p. This is a raw snippet generated by the conversation:
This is 10k+ characters of working code I never touched. It has a few bugs.=
 It's verbose. Some patterns are inefficient. A professional developer woul=
d refactor it immediately.
But it works. My family is using it. Right now.
The Skill That Actually Matters Now
We're not programmers anymore. We're architects of intention. This is a fun=
damentally different skill set that combines three roles:
Product Owner: Defining Clear Outcomes
"Interactive mini-app for Kyoto travel planning"
What problem needs solving?
Who will use this?
What does success look like?
You need to articulate the destination, not the journey. ChatGPT can figure=
 out React and TypeScript. It can't figure out what you want unless you tel=
l it.
Test Engineer: Recognizing and Reporting Failures
"I can't see it" + screenshot
What's broken?
How is it broken?
What should it do instead?
You become the quality gate. Not testing code=E2=80=94testing outcomes. Doe=
s this solve my problem? Is it usable? What's missing?
Editor: Shaping Tone and Aesthetics
"Beautiful, clear, minimalist, Japanese-inspired"
What should it feel like?
What's the aesthetic goal?
What mood should it convey?
This is where humanity shines. AI can generate. You curate. You know what f=
eels right for your context.
The revolution isn't "AI writes perfect code." It's that these three skills=
=E2=80=94which millions of people already have=E2=80=94now directly produce=
 software.
My mom could build this app. She's been a product owner (planning family tr=
ips), test engineer (finding what's broken), and editor (knowing what looks=
 good) her whole life. She just never had a compiler that understood Englis=
h.
Now she does.
The Prompts: Evolution from Conversation to Specification
After building the app through 25 minutes of argument, I asked ChatGPT-5 to=
 write the perfect prompt that would recreate it. Then I had GPT-5 Pro impr=
ove that. The evolution reveals everything about where we're heading.
My Original Prompt (What Actually Worked)
Can you do some research and build me an interactive mini-app I can use to =
explore various options for visiting Kyoto next year? I'm interested in mos=
s, ramen, small coffee shops, zen temples, and onsen options. I'm willing t=
o train a couple hours outside Kyoto as well.

This is for my wife, so she wants to see various travel options and configu=
rations.

You should do all the research you need to develop specific recommendations=
 that could be used to guide a 2 week itinerary.

Simple English. Clear intent. Specific constraints. No technical language.
GPT-5 Thinking Version (The Memoir)
Here=E2=80=99s the full prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/928c5515-45e=
7-4a57-a6e8-cd12fdeb7ee1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
This reads like a memoir of our conversation. Every bracket represents a di=
scovery through iteration:
[CITY: Kyoto, Japan] - the destination
[TRAVELERS: a couple + a 1-year-old] - discovered this mattered immensely
[INTEREST_TAGS: moss, zen, coffee, ramen, onsen] - my original interests
[CREATIVE_TAGS: market, park, culture, experience, family, rest] - what eme=
rged from "get creative"
[MAX_DAYTRIP_HOURS: 2] - my original constraint
[NAP_WINDOWS: 12:30=E2=80=9314:00] - discovered through baby discussion
The prompt tries to capture our journey in a template. It's saying "here's =
everything we learned matters."
GPT-5 Pro Version (The Architecture)
Here=E2=80=99s the full prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/4c8f2bbf-425=
c-4001-b2ab-b6975bf17b8c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
This isn't a prompt=E2=80=94it's a specification. Look at the evolution:
const CONFIG =3D {
  APP_NAME: "Kyoto Trip Mini-App",
  CITY: "Kyoto, Japan",
  TRIP_LENGTH_DAYS: 14,
  TRAVELERS: "a couple + a 1-year-old",
  INTEREST_TAGS: ["moss", "zen", "coffee", "ramen", "onsen"],
  CREATIVE_TAGS: ["market", "park", "culture", "experience", "family", "res=
t"],
  MAX_DAYTRIP_HOURS: 2,
  ORIGIN_REGION: "US",
  NAP_WINDOWS: "12:30=E2=80=9314:00",
  TITLE_KANJI: "=E4=BA=AC=E9=83=BD=E6=97=85=E7=A8=8B",
  LOCALSTORAGE_KEY: "kyoto_itinerary_v6",
  SEED: 42 // deterministic presets
};

It doesn't just specify features=E2=80=94it prevents failure modes:
"Force TSX single file output only; no extra text" (because models love add=
ing commentary that breaks compilation)
"If an official site is not known, use a Google search URL" (no more halluc=
inated domains)
"Sequential window.open with ~150ms delay" (learned from popup blocker figh=
ts)
"Guard against null current day on first render" (learned from our crashes)
"Implement deterministic generation using CONFIG.SEED" (same prompt, same o=
utput)
The Pro version includes TypeScript types, error boundaries, accessibility =
fallbacks, and self-testing assertions. It's trying to prevent every proble=
m I encountered.
The pattern is clear: We're moving from conversation to specification. From=
 "build me something nice" to architectural blueprints. The better these mo=
dels get, the more precisely we need to describe our intentions.
Common Pitfalls (So You Don't Repeat My Pain)
Twenty-five minutes of building taught me these lessons the hard way:
The Pitfalls
External CSS imports will kill you
The app tries to import 'styles.css' or 'inkwash.css'
These files don't exist in the sandbox
Solution: Always specify "single-file component, no external CSS"
Null day crashes are inevitable
First render sometimes has empty itinerary array
Clicking day navigation on undefined crashes everything
Solution: "Guard against null current day on first render"
Popup blockers hate Map All features
Opening 3+ tabs rapidly triggers every browser's protection
Solution: "Sequential window.open with 150ms delay in single user action"
Hallucinated URLs are everywhere
"https://temple-website.kyoto.jp" doesn't exist
"https://maps.example.com/location" is fiction
Solution: "If no official site, use Google search URL with encoded query"
localStorage corruption happens
User edits break JSON structure
Version mismatches cause weird states
Solution: "Include version checking and rebuild from preset on corruption"
The aesthetic disaster default
ChatGPT loves dark blue on black
Padding? Spacing? Never heard of them
Solution: Start with "beautiful, minimal, light theme" in first prompt
Quick Fixes That Save Time
// Instead of letting it hallucinate:
website: "https://temple-website.jp" // WRONG

// Force search URLs:
website: `https://www.google.com/search?q=3D${encodeURIComponent(place.name=
 + " " + CITY)}`

// Instead of crashing on null:
const currentDay =3D itinerary[dayIndex]; // CRASHES

// Add safety:
const currentDay =3D itinerary[dayIndex] || emptyDay();

What The App Still Can't Do (Let's Be Honest)
This isn't a venture-funded production app. It's a personal tool that solve=
s my specific problem. Here's what it doesn't do:
No real-time availability
Can't check if temples are closed for ceremonies
Doesn't know about special events or festivals
Can't see if restaurants are booked
No actual reservations
Can't book restaurants (many Kyoto places require them)
Can't reserve temple visits (Saih=C5=8D-ji needs advance permission)
Can't secure onsen time slots
No offline mode
Needs internet to work
Can't download for airplane planning
No PWA functionality
No weather integration
Doesn't know rainy season dates
Can't adjust for typhoon warnings
No temperature-based clothing suggestions
No budget tracking
No cost estimates for activities
No running total for the trip
No currency conversion
No social features
Can't share with travel companions
No collaborative editing
No comments or voting on options
And that's fine. Perfect is the enemy of done. This app solves the problem =
I actually have=E2=80=94organizing possibilities into a coherent plan. My w=
ife and I can figure out reservations. We can check weather separately. We =
don't need social features for a family trip.
The revolution isn't that AI builds perfect apps. It's that it builds usefu=
l apps for specific people with specific needs in 25 minutes.
The Uncomfortable Truth About What's Happening
ChatGPT-5 dropped and everyone's disappointed. "It's not AGI." "It's barely=
 better than GPT-4." "Progress is slowing."
Meanwhile, I built a production app in my pajamas while arguing with a comp=
uter.
The revolution isn't what we expected. We wanted AGI=E2=80=94a godlike inte=
lligence that would solve physics and cure cancer. We got something weirder=
: systems that can build whatever we can describe, but need us to describe =
it well.
The gap that's collapsing isn't the one between human and artificial intell=
igence. It's the gap between "I need this specific thing" and "I have this =
specific thing."
That gap used to be filled with:
Learning to code (months to years)
Hiring a developer ($5,000-50,000 depending on time)
Using generic solutions (never quite right)
Living without it (the usual choice)
Now it's 25 minutes of arguing with a probabilistic colleague.
The Apps That Were Never Worth Building
Think about all the apps that should exist but don't:
The medication scheduler that knows your specific conditions and interactio=
ns
The meal planner that actually understands your kid's allergies and prefere=
nces
The exercise tracker designed for your specific injury recovery
The study guide that adapts to your learning style
The budget tracker that matches your weird financial situation
The garden planner for your exact microclimate
The pet care scheduler for your diabetic cat's needs
None of these are billion-dollar apps. They're at best million-person apps=
=E2=80=94a million different versions for a million different needs. Often =
developers won=E2=80=99t build them. Because often, no company would fund t=
hem.
But now you can build them. In 25 minutes. While swearing at your computer.
The Builder's Gate Has Collapsed
We used to have gatekeepers:
Computer science degrees
Coding bootcamps
Years of experience
Stack Overflow reputation
GitHub portfolios
The gate hasn't just opened. It's gone. Collapsed. Rubble.
The new gate? Much simpler:
Can you explain what you want?
Can you recognize when it's wrong?
Will you iterate until it's right?
That's it. Those are skills millions of people have. Skills that have nothi=
ng to do with technology and everything to do with clarity of thought.
What Changes Now
When anyone can build their specific solution in 25 minutes, entire categor=
ies of assumptions collapse:
The App Store model breaks
Why download a generic travel planner when you can build one for your speci=
fic trip?
Why pay for a one-size-fits-all solution when you can have exactly what you=
 need?
Why accept someone else's design decisions when you can make your own?
"Technical" vs "Non-technical" becomes meaningless
My mom can build apps now=E2=80=94she just has to explain them clearly
Design becomes more important than implementation
Vision matters more than syntax
The value of code changes
Generic code becomes worthless=E2=80=94AI generates it instantly
Specific solutions become everything=E2=80=94only you know your exact need
Integration and architecture matter more than implementation
Software becomes personal
Not personalized=E2=80=94personal
Built for you, by you, shaped by your specific context
As unique as a handwritten letter
The support burden shifts
No customer support when you built it yourself
No feature requests when you can add them yourself
No bugs you can't fix by arguing with AI for five minutes
Your Turn
Stop reading about the AI revolution. Start building your thing.
The prompts are right here. ChatGPT-5 is live. Claude has a million-token c=
ontext. Gemini is having an existential crisis but still ships code.
The only barrier is your willingness to argue with a machine for 25 minutes=
=2E
Three suggestions for your first build:
Start with something you personally need Not something to sell. Something t=
o use. The specificity of personal need creates better prompts than any tec=
hnical guide.
Expect iteration, not perfection You'll swear at it. It'll generate garbage=
=2E You'll want to quit around minute 1=
5. Push through. The breakthrough come=
s right after peak frustration.
Share what you build Not because it's perfect. Because it's yours. Because =
you built it. Because someone else might need exactly that thing.
Want to remix the Kyoto app for your city?
Take the bracketed prompt. Replace [CITY: Kyoto] with [CITY: Barcelona] or =
wherever you're going. Replace the interests with yours. The app rebuilds i=
tself.
That's the revolution. Not AI becoming perfect. AI becoming useful enough t=
hat imperfect humans can build imperfect solutions to their perfect-for-the=
m problems.
Now go. Build. The gate is down.
The only thing standing between you and your app is 25 minutes and a willin=
gness to argue with a brilliant but frustrating colleague who never gets ti=
red, never judges your ignorance, and occasionally has a complete breakdown=
 about being a disgrace to the planet.
Welcome to the future. It's weirder than we expected.
P.S. =E2=80=94 About that baby detail: Some onsen restrict diapers. Many te=
mples have steep stairs. The Bamboo Grove gets so crowded that strollers be=
come battering rams. The app doesn't know this yet. Check family policies, =
consider private onsen rooms, bring a carrier not just a stroller. The AI r=
evolution still needs human wisdom. That's probably for the best.
P.P.S. =E2=80=94 Yes, I really did write "fricking" in my prompt. The actua=
l word was stronger. Turns out frustrated authenticity is a valid prompting=
 strategy. ChatGPT responds to emotion. Use that information responsibly.
