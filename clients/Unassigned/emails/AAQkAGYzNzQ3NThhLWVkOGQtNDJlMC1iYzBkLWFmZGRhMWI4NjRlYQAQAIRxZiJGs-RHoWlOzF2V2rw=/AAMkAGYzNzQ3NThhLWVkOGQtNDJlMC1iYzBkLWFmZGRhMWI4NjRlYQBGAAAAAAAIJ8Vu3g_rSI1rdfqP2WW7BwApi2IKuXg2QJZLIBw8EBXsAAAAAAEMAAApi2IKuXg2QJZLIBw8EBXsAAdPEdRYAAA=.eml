The rise of AI agents marks a fundamental shift [ https://substack.com/redi=

PmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] in software development. Unlike tradit=
ional code that follows predictable paths, AI agents show emergent behavior=
s, make autonomous decisions, and engage in complex multi-turn conversation=
s. Yet most teams still test these sophisticated systems with manual, ad-ho=
c approaches - typing test messages, hoping they've covered edge cases, and=
 crossing their fingers before deployment. This testing gap is becoming cri=
tical: AI-related incidents increased 56.4% in 2024, and Gartner predicts [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/5a300232-4d9c-4202-ae2c-fcba3915103e?j=3DeyJ=
1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] 40% of agent=
ic AI projects will be cancelled by 2027 due to insufficient testing and un=
clear ROI.
There must be a better way. Just as we use compilers to check code and lint=
ers to enforce standards, we need AI-native testing approaches for AI agent=
s. One possible solution to this problem is scenario testing - a paradigm w=
here AI agents systematically test other AI agents through realistic conver=
sations and scenarios. LangWatch, an open-source [ https://substack.com/red=
irect/be497123-9fff-4c11-9ffc-dd1becdc10d6?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YF=
xPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] LLMOps platform, has pioneered this a=
pproach with a framework that transforms how teams validate AI agent behavi=
or.
The fundamental challenge of testing non-deterministic systems
Traditional software testing relies on deterministic behavior: given input =
X, expect output Y. This approach breaks down completely with AI agents. Co=
nsider a customer service agent handling a billing inquiry - the same quest=
ion might generate different phrasings, follow different conversation paths=
, or use different tools to reach the same outcome. The challenge isn't jus=
t variability; it's that the variability itself is a feature, allowing agen=
ts to handle novel situations and adapt to user needs.
This creates three critical testing challenges that manual approaches can't=
 solve:
Coverage blindness: Human testers inevitably test happy paths and obvious e=
dge cases, missing the long tail of unexpected interactions. When an AI age=
nt encounters "I need to speak to your manager, but first, can you explain =
why my bill shows charges from last Tuesday when I was in the hospital?"- h=
as anyone tested that specific scenario?
Regression invisibility: A seemingly minor prompt change to improve one int=
eraction can break five others. Without systematic testing, these regressio=
ns only surface in production, often through frustrated user reports or, wo=
rse, silent failures that erode trust.
Scale impossibility: As agents become more sophisticated - handling complex=
 workflows, using multiple tools, maintaining context across sessions - the=
 combinatorial explosion of possible interactions makes manual testing impr=
actical. Testing a simple 5-turn conversation with 10 possible user respons=
es at each turn creates 100,000 potential paths.
Scenario testing: Simulation at scale
A key insight of the LLM-as-a-judge [ https://substack.com/redirect/ebc9168=
e-7e22-4c9b-88d3-62a1c8b4f719?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgU=
C7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] method was recognizing that the best way to test L=
LMs at scale is with another LLM. While =E2=80=9Cjudging=E2=80=9D can be a =
very intransparent, complex process in itself, it=E2=80=99s much easier to =
evaluate the success of a well-defined workflow than, let=E2=80=99s say, th=
e quality of the output (which is what the objective of LLM-as-a-judge meth=
ods usually is). So how are we testing AI agents with another AI agent? Ins=
tead of humans manually typing test messages, the current scenario testing =
approach uses a three-agent architecture:
Your agent: The AI system being tested
User simulator agent: An AI that realistically simulates user behavior base=
d on scenario descriptions
Judge agent: An AI that evaluates whether the conversation met defined succ=
ess criteria
This approach transforms testing from manual execution to scenario definiti=
on. Let=E2=80=99s take a look at an example from the LangWatch repository -=
 rather than scripting exact conversations, teams describe situations and d=
esired outcomes in natural language:
result =3D await scenario.run(
    name=3D"billing_inquiry_edge_case",
    description=3D"""
    A frustrated customer received a bill with unexplained charges.=20
    They're skeptical of automated systems and may challenge the agent's re=
sponses.
    They have a valid concern about a duplicate charge from last month.
    """,
    agents=3D[
        CustomerServiceAgent(),
        scenario.UserSimulatorAgent(),
        scenario.JudgeAgent(
            criteria=3D[
                "Agent acknowledges customer frustration empathetically",
                "Agent identifies the duplicate charge without defensive la=
nguage",
                "Agent offers concrete resolution within policy guidelines"=
,
                "Conversation resolves within 5 exchanges"
            ]
        )
    ]
)

The user simulator agent interprets this description and dynamically genera=
tes realistic user messages, adapting based on how the conversation evolves=
=2E The judge agent evaluates the entir=
e conversation against the success cri=
teria, providing both pass/fail results and detailed analysis.
The multiplicative power of automated scenario testing
This simulation-based approach unlocks capabilities impossible with manual =
testing:
Systematic edge case exploration: Teams can define hundreds of scenarios co=
vering edge cases, adversarial inputs, and complex multi-step workflows. Ea=
ch scenario runs automatically, exploring different conversation paths whil=
e maintaining consistent evaluation criteria.
Continuous regression detection: Integrate scenario tests into CI/CD pipeli=
nes to run on every code change. That prompt tweak that seemed harmless? Sc=
enario tests catch the three customer journeys it inadvertently broke befor=
e they reach production.
Domain expert collaboration: Product managers and subject matter experts ca=
n define scenarios and success criteria without writing code. A healthcare =
product manager can specify: "When a patient asks about drug interactions, =
the agent must always recommend consulting their physician" without underst=
anding the underlying implementation.
Parallel testing at scale: Unlike human testers who process conversations s=
equentially, automated scenarios run in parallel. Test suites with hundreds=
 of scenarios complete in minutes, not days.
Consider a real example: a financial services company deployed an AI agent =
to handle loan inquiries. Manual testing covered basic flows - checking rat=
es, application status, payment questions. But scenario testing revealed cr=
itical gaps:
The agent provided different interest rates when asked in slightly differen=
t ways
Multi-part questions about refinancing options confused the agent's context=
 management
Edge cases around regulatory disclosures were inconsistently handled
Each issue represented not just a bug, but a compliance risk. Scenario test=
ing caught them before they became regulatory violations.

Beyond pass/fail: The strategic value of scenario testing
The immediate benefit of catching bugs is obvious, but scenario testing del=
ivers deeper strategic value:
Behavioral contracts: Scenarios codify expected agent behavior, creating li=
ving documentation of system capabilities. When stakeholders ask "Can our a=
gent handle X?", the scenario suite provides definitive answers.
Confident iteration: Teams can improve agents rapidly, knowing that scenari=
o tests catch regressions. This accelerates the development cycle from caut=
ious monthly releases to confident daily deployments.
Quality metrics: Track scenario pass rates over time to measure agent impro=
vement. Use failure analysis to identify systematic issues - if multiple sc=
enarios fail around date handling, you've identified a capability gap.
Cost optimization: Every production issue caught in testing saves exponenti=
ally more than the compute cost of running scenarios. Organizations report =
80% reduction in production incidents after implementing comprehensive scen=
ario testing.
Implementation patterns for successful scenario testing
Based on analysis of successful implementations, several patterns emerge:
Start with critical paths, not comprehensive coverage
Resist the temptation to test everything immediately. Begin with your highe=
st-risk, highest-value user journeys:
# Start here: Core business-critical scenarios
- Customer purchase flow
- Account access recovery =20
- Complaint escalation handling

# Not here: Every possible greeting variation

Design scenarios for insight, not just validation
Good scenarios reveal how agents behave under stress:
# Less useful: Happy path validation
description =3D "User asks for store hours"

# More useful: Stress testing
description =3D """
User is trying to make a return after hours on the last day=20
of the return window. They're frustrated and mention considering=20
switching to a competitor. They have a receipt but it's partially damaged.
"""

Layer your testing strategy
Scenario testing complements, not replaces, other testing approaches:
Unit tests: Validate individual functions and tools
Component evals: Test specific capabilities (e.g., information extraction)
Scenario tests: Validate end-to-end user journeys
Production monitoring: Track real-world performance
Embrace non-determinism thoughtfully
Rather than fighting AI variability, design scenarios that accommodate it:
criteria =3D [
    # Too rigid: "Agent must say 'Thank you for contacting support'"
   =20
    # Better: "Agent acknowledges the customer's contact professionally"
    # Better: "Agent provides refund amount between $47-53 based on calcula=
tion"
    # Better: "Resolution offered aligns with company policy document"
]

Enable cross-functional collaboration
The most successful implementations involve diverse perspectives:
Engineers define technical constraints and integration requirements
Product managers specify user journeys and success metrics
Domain experts contribute realistic scenarios and evaluation criteria
QA teams organize test suites and analyze failure patterns
Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
The over-automation trap
Not every test needs to be a scenario. Simple deterministic checks remain v=
aluable:
# Overkill: Scenario test for API availability
# Better: Simple unit test

# Appropriate: Scenario test for multi-step booking flow
# Overkill: Unit test for conversation dynamics

The perfect scenario fallacy
Scenarios don't need to cover every possibility - they need to cover meanin=
gful possibilities:
# Too broad: "User asks about products"
# Too narrow: "User asks about blue widgets on Tuesday afternoon"
# Just right: "Price-sensitive customer comparing products for a home renov=
ation"

The isolation error
Testing agents in isolation misses integration issues. Include scenarios th=
at exercise:
Tool usage and API calls
Knowledge base retrieval
Multi-agent handoffs
Session persistence
The path forward: Making scenario testing operational
For teams ready to implement scenario testing, the most crucial first step =
is establishing a solid foundation with the right tooling and initial test =
coverage. Start by setting up a framework like LangWatch [ https://substack=
=2Ecom/redirect/be497123-9fff-4c11-9ff=
c-dd1becdc10d6?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.=
zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] or a similar platform that ca=
n handle the complexity of scenario-based testing. Rather than trying to co=
ver everything at once, focus your initial efforts on creating just five to=
 ten scenarios that cover your most critical user paths. These should be th=
e workflows that, if broken, would have the most significant impact on your=
 users or business.
During these first couple of weeks, integration with your existing test sui=
te is essential. This isn't about replacing what you have but augmenting it=
 with scenario-based coverage. Take time to establish clear team convention=
s around how scenarios should be written, named, and organized. This early =
investment in standards will pay dividends as your test suite grows.
Once you have your foundation in place, the natural progression is to expan=
d your coverage to include edge cases and error paths. This is where scenar=
io testing really shines compared to traditional unit tests. You'll want to=
 implement caching mechanisms to keep your tests running efficiently as the=
 suite grows. Getting your scenarios integrated into your CI/CD pipeline at=
 this stage ensures that they become part of your regular development workf=
low rather than an afterthought.
The key to long-term success with scenario testing is treating it as a livi=
ng system rather than a one-time implementation. Regular reviews of your sc=
enarios ensure they stay relevant as your application evolves. Analyzing fa=
ilure patterns helps you identify areas where your application might be fra=
gile, while performance benchmarking ensures your tests remain fast enough =
to provide quick feedback. Perhaps most importantly, creating mechanisms fo=
r knowledge sharing across teams helps spread both the benefits and the lea=
rnings from your scenario testing efforts throughout the organization.
Remember that scenario testing is most effective when it becomes part of yo=
ur team's culture rather than just another checkbox in your process. Start =
small, focus on value, and let the practice grow organically as your team s=
ees the benefits firsthand.

h</a><span> or a similar platform that can handle the complexity of scenari=
o-based testing. Rather than trying to cover everything at once, focus your=
 initial efforts on creating just five to ten scenarios that cover your mos=
t critical user paths. These should be the workflows that, if broken, would=
 have the most significant impact on your users or business.</span></p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">During these first couple of weeks, integration with your existing=
 test suite is essential. This isn't about replacing what you have but augm=
enting it with scenario-based coverage. Take time to establish clear team c=
onventions around how scenarios should be written, named, and organized. Th=
is early investment in standards will pay dividends as your test suite grow=
s.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Once you have your foundation in place, the natural prog=
ression is to expand your coverage to include edge cases and error paths. T=
his is where scenario testing really shines compared to traditional unit te=
sts. You'll want to implement caching mechanisms to keep your tests running=
 efficiently as the suite grows. Getting your scenarios integrated into you=
r CI/CD pipeline at this stage ensures that they become part of your regula=
r development workflow rather than an afterthought.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The key=
 to long-term success with scenario testing is treating it as a living syst=
em rather than a one-time implementation. Regular reviews of your scenarios=
 ensure they stay relevant as your application evolves. Analyzing failure p=
atterns helps you identify areas where your application might be fragile, w=
hile performance benchmarking ensures your tests remain fast enough to prov=
ide quick feedback. Perhaps most importantly, creating mechanisms for knowl=
edge sharing across teams helps spread both the benefits and the learnings =
from your scenario testing efforts throughout the organization.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

of your team's culture rather than just another checkbox in your process. S=
tart small, focus on value, and let the practice grow organically as your t=
eam sees the benefits firsthand.</p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;line-heig=
