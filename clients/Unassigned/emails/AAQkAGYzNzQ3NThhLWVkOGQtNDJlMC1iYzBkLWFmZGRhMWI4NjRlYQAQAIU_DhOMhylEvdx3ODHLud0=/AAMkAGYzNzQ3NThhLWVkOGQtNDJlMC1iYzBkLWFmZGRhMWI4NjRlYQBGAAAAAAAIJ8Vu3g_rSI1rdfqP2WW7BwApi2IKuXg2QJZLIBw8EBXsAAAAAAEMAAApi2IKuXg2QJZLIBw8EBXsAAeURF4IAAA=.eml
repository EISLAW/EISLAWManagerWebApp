GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: POWERS OLD AND NEW [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
_Question: I think your assessment of Hitler and Germany was bang on. Your answer to the question about Germany should be taught in every history class in the world. One fool fired a shot and nations
were destroyed. Can you give a similar outline for Putin as both have some interesting parallels as the Russian-Ukraine war is eerily similar? Both sides are locked in a conflict they cannot exit.  _
Response: Russia has always been governed by authoritarian leaders. Its first czar, who came to power in the 16th century, was Ivan the Terrible. In that sense, the nature of Russian leaders during
the Soviet era and Putin today is the manner in which they rose to power, not in the manner in which they governed. The czars became rulers because they were children of czars.  The communists
overthrew the czars and were selected formally by the Politburo, but in actuality they exerted their power over the Politburo. Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev  were all authoritarian rulers
with varying degrees of power and brutality. Gorbachev sought to rule differently but was ineffective. Hitler arose because of the circumstances of his time. Putin was, in effect, returning to the
authoritarian model that had been in place for centuries. Put simply, the circumstances that surrounded Putin were a return to a cultural norm. Why this norm exists in Russia is difficult to
understand. My theory, of uncertain value, is that Russia is a vast and diverse country that can be held together only by a ruler who can intimidate regional governors. If power flowed to regional
governors, then Russia might disintegrate. After the fall of Soviet Union, and the interlude playing with liberal democracy, Russian culture, built on the fear of disintegration, demanded a powerful
ruler, and that was what Putin became, and Russia returned to its storm. Like I said, best guess.
-------------------------
_Question: "In the current case, President Donald Trump can only serve out the remainder of his term. Therefore, a new president will preside over the two crises, with the storm calming toward the end
of the decade." But President Trump will attempt to run in 2028.  He is not willingly going to give up the White House. He and his legal team will make an argument that the 22nd Amendment of the
Constitution only refers to consecutive terms. The Supreme Court could interpret it as so and agree with President Trump's argument. The current membership of the SCOTUS ruled that Mr. Trump was still
eligible to run in 2024 despite the fact that many constitutional scholars argued he violated the Insurrection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Also, if the Republican Party holds the majority in the
House in 2028, and a Democrat wins the presidency, they can refuse to certify the Electoral College vote. Over 140 Republican congress members were willing to do that in 2020. Will the Storm in 2028
be a Category 5 hurricane for this country?_
Response: I do not think the nation would accept such a violation of the constitution. Trump has lost a great deal of support, according to polls based on his current actions, which are much milder
than running again. I think that the opposition to that would be intense from both sides.  I also doubt that he would try that, because while a strange president in many ways, he, like all
presidents, wants to be admired by history. So if he ran, I don’t think he would win. If he would refuse to leave office, I think there would be hell to pay on both sides. Trump is far from stupid,
and trying to remain president in spite of the Constitution would be stupid. Also, he is 79 years old. Now, I am not one to be impressed by the idea that that is very old, but he will be 82 when his
term ends, and 86 when his next term would end. Like I said, all this stuff about growing older is nonsense. It’s a piece of cake. But then I’m younger than he is.
-------------------------
_Question: I read your book, and I felt you have a great "crystal ball". When you look at Washington and see the division between the Democrats and the Republicans do you feel that there is ever a
chance they will move to a more balanced approach to actually coming together rather than always just disagreeing with each other? You say, or I think you say, that they are a reflection of who they
represent but I don't feel that way because it seems that they just take sides not as an independent elected official but seem to go along with "group think" of their party. I know we need to fix many
things in our federal government but just to go along to get along doesn't seem to be a good strategy for the American people. Maybe I am wrong about my thinking on this but I always appreciate your
take on things like this. _
Response: I have little doubt that relative unity will not be restored. We are a democracy, and division is the norm, and sometimes intense. But this is very far from the worst division in American
history. I would think  Lincoln’s election that led to civil war was a couple notches above this. The division in the Great Depression was far graver than this. The division in the 1970s over race
and the Vietnam War, both frequently violent, was pretty bad. So I do not see the current division as particularly worrisome. If we could get together after the Civil War, the Great Depression, and
the 1960s, we will get through this. I would also say that division is fundamental virtue of democracy. In non-democratic societies, there is little dynamism.  Division is the fundamental driver in
historic change and development.  If you want unity, there are other forms of government that will give it to you. Mutual loathing means that democracy is doing its thing. So watching the idiocy and
self-righteousness of both sides is an occasion of hilarity, not fear. But then I grew up in the Bronx. I see a good gang war as a work of art.
-------------------------
_Question: Trump’s decision to increase the isolation of USA from the world can only give an increased influence of China in the SOUTH of the world, Africa and Latin America, taking control of vital
mineral resources  like in Chile where there is the main concentration of Lithium in a salted desert area)? In the book “The Decline of America Empire,” when a power is withdrawing from its area
of influence, immediately other powers will try to take territories and influence. Additionally, Russia will try to conquest more influence over European Union to delay and block the financing to
Ukraine and the supply of weapons, to be able to finally win the war and re-conquering the capital Kyiv. At that point, a movement supported by Russia and China can start a “Boycott American
products” in favor of local (Chinese) products to progressively weaken the American economy and the war capacity. How do you see this perspective?_
Response: What you say is correct in principle, but in this case it is more complex. First, the U.S. is not geographically entangled in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is geographically divided by two
oceans. Power dynamics in the Eastern Hemisphere became an issue only when after its command of the Atlantic and Pacific was challenged. The U.S. entered World War I when the German U-boats started
sinking transatlantic shipping. Its stayed out of World War II, even as it supplied aid to Britain to block the Germans. The U.S. did not declare war on Germany; Germany declared war on the U.S. In
the Lend-Lease Act, there was a codicil that committed Britain, in the event it was forced to surrender, to send the Royal Navy to Canada. Later, the U.S. went to war with Japan only after it attacked
the fleet at Pearl Harbor.
During the Cold War, one of the primary reasons the U.S. created NATO was to deny Russia access from Atlantic-bound ports in France and Germany. There is a degree to which the U.S. has an interest in
limiting Russian and Chinese power in the Eastern Hemisphere, but it is not a fundamental geopolitical imperative as the oceans are. After all, American entanglement in the Eastern Hemisphere led to a
series of costly wars from Korea to Afghanistan. In the end, Russia and China are threats only if they intrude on the oceans. Washington can weaken them in various ways, but constant military warfare
in the Eastern Hemisphere will not be one of them.
The conflict in Ukraine shows that the U.S. can bleed Russia by sending weapons instead of troops. In the case of China, the U.S. can exert its influence by limiting access to export to the U.S.
market. China’s economy is reeling, and finding markets for its exports in the rest of the world is proving difficult. So there is a self-limiting reality on Russian and Chinese power that gives the
U.S. an option it hasn’t had since 1941 – that is, not being overly entangled in the Eastern Hemisphere. And the U.S. has significant economic leverage on China, while Russian power has shown
itself to be much weakened since the Cold War.  So from where I sit, the old geopolitical system has become obsolete, and the new one gives us much more breathing room.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Russia h=
as always been governed by authoritarian leaders. Its first czar, who came =
to power in the 16th century, was Ivan the Terrible. In that sense, the nat=
ure of Russian leaders during the Soviet era and Putin today is the manner =
in which they rose to power, not in the manner in which they governed. The =
czars became rulers because they were children of czars.&nbsp; The communis=
ts overthrew the czars and were selected formally by the Politburo, but in =
actuality they exerted their power over the Politburo. Lenin, Stalin, Khrus=
hchev and Brezhnev&nbsp; were all authoritarian rulers with varying degrees=
 of power and brutality. Gorbachev sought to rule differently but was ineff=
ective. Hitler arose because of the circumstances of his time. Putin was, i=
n effect, returning to the authoritarian model that had been in place for c=
enturies. Put simply, the circumstances that surrounded Putin were a return=
 to a cultural norm. Why this norm exists in Russia is difficult to underst=
and. My theory, of uncertain value, is that Russia is a vast and diverse co=
untry that can be held together only by a ruler who can intimidate regional=
 governors. If power flowed to regional governors, then Russia might disint=
egrate. After the fall of Soviet Union, and the interlude playing with libe=
ral democracy, Russian culture, built on the fear of disintegration, demand=
ed a powerful ruler, and that was what Putin became, and Russia returned to=
 its storm. Like I said, best guess.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: &quo=
t;In the current case, President Donald Trump can only serve out the remain=
der of his term. Therefore, a new president will preside over the two crise=
s, with the storm calming toward the end of the decade.&quot; But President=
 Trump will attempt to run in 2028.&nbsp; He is not willingly going to give=
 up the White House. He and his legal team will make an argument that the 2=
2nd Amendment of the Constitution only refers to consecutive terms. The Sup=
reme Court could interpret it as so and agree with President Trump's argume=
nt. The current membership of the SCOTUS ruled that Mr. Trump was still eli=
gible to run in 2024 despite the fact that many constitutional scholars arg=
ued he violated the Insurrection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Also, if the=
 Republican Party holds the majority in the House in 2028, and a Democrat w=
ins the presidency, they can refuse to certify the Electoral College vote. =
Over 140 Republican congress members were willing to do that in 2020. Will =
the Storm in 2028 be a Category 5 hurricane for this country?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I do not=
 think the nation would accept such a violation of the constitution. Trump =
has lost a great deal of support, according to polls based on his current a=
ctions, which are much milder than running again. I think that the oppositi=
on to that would be intense from both sides.&nbsp; I also doubt that he wou=
ld try that, because while a strange president in many ways, he, like all p=
residents, wants to be admired by history. So if he ran, I don=E2=80=99t th=
ink he would win. If he would refuse to leave office, I think there would b=
e hell to pay on both sides. Trump is far from stupid, and trying to remain=
 president in spite of the Constitution would be stupid. Also, he is 79 yea=
rs old. Now, I am not one to be impressed by the idea that that is very old=
, but he will be 82 when his term ends, and 86 when his next term would end=
. Like I said, all this stuff about growing older is nonsense. It=E2=80=99s=
 a piece of cake. But then I=E2=80=99m younger than he is.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: I re=
ad your book, and I felt you have a great &quot;crystal ball&quot;. When yo=
u look at Washington and see the division between the Democrats and the Rep=
ublicans do you feel that there is ever a chance they will move to a more b=
alanced approach to actually coming together rather than always just disagr=
eeing with each other? You say, or I think you say, that they are a reflect=
ion of who they represent but I don't feel that way because it seems that t=
hey just take sides not as an independent elected official but seem to go a=
long with &quot;group think&quot; of their party. I know we need to fix man=
y things in our federal government but just to go along to get along doesn'=
t seem to be a good strategy for the American people. Maybe I am wrong abou=
t my thinking on this but I always appreciate your take on things like this=
. </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I have l=
ittle doubt that relative unity will not be restored. We are a democracy, a=
nd division is the norm, and sometimes intense. But this is very far from t=
he worst division in American history. I would think&nbsp; Lincoln=E2=80=99=
s election that led to civil war was a couple notches above this. The divis=
ion in the Great Depression was far graver than this. The division in the 1=
970s over race and the Vietnam War, both frequently violent, was pretty bad=
. So I do not see the current division as particularly worrisome. If we cou=
ld get together after the Civil War, the Great Depression, and the 1960s, w=
e will get through this. I would also say that division is fundamental virt=
ue of democracy. In non-democratic societies, there is little dynamism.&nbs=
p; Division is the fundamental driver in historic change and development.&n=
bsp; If you want unity, there are other forms of government that will give =
it to you. Mutual loathing means that democracy is doing its thing. So watc=
hing the idiocy and self-righteousness of both sides is an occasion of hila=
rity, not fear. But then I grew up in the Bronx. I see a good gang war as a=
 work of art.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Trum=
p=E2=80=99s decision to increase the isolation of USA from the world can on=
ly give an increased influence of China in the SOUTH of the world, Africa a=

avor of local (Chinese) products to progressively weaken the American econo=
my and the war capacity. How do you see this perspective?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: What you=
 say is correct in principle, but in this case it is more complex. First, t=
he U.S. is not geographically entangled in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is ge=
ographically divided by two oceans. Power dynamics in the Eastern Hemispher=
e became an issue only when after its command of the Atlantic and Pacific w=
as challenged. The U.S. entered World War I when the German U-boats started=
 sinking transatlantic shipping. Its stayed out of World War II, even as it=
 supplied aid to Britain to block the Germans. The U.S. did not declare war=
 on Germany; Germany declared war on the U.S. In the Lend-Lease Act, there =
was a codicil that committed Britain, in the event it was forced to surrend=
er, to send the Royal Navy to Canada. Later, the U.S. went to war with Japa=
n only after it attacked the fleet at Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">During the Cold Wa=
r, one of the primary reasons the U.S. created NATO was to deny Russia acce=
ss from Atlantic-bound ports in France and Germany. There is a degree to wh=
ich the U.S. has an interest in limiting Russian and Chinese power in the E=
astern Hemisphere, but it is not a fundamental geopolitical imperative as t=
he oceans are. After all, American entanglement in the Eastern Hemisphere l=
ed to a series of costly wars from Korea to Afghanistan. In the end, Russia=
 and China are threats only if they intrude on the oceans. Washington can w=
eaken them in various ways, but constant military warfare in the Eastern He=
misphere will not be one of them.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The conflict in Uk=
raine shows that the U.S. can bleed Russia by sending weapons instead of tr=
oops. In the case of China, the U.S. can exert its influence by limiting ac=
cess to export to the U.S. market. China=E2=80=99s economy is reeling, and =
finding markets for its exports in the rest of the world is proving difficu=
lt. So there is a self-limiting reality on Russian and Chinese power that g=
ives the U.S. an option it hasn=E2=80=99t had since 1941 =E2=80=93 that is,=
 not being overly entangled in the Eastern Hemisphere. And the U.S. has sig=
nificant economic leverage on China, while Russian power has shown itself t=
o be much weakened since the Cold War.&nbsp; So from where I sit, the old g=
eopolitical system has become obsolete, and the new one gives us much more =
breathing room.</p>
