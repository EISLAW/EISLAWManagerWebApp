how to build evaluations that actually improve your product, not just gener=

Over the past two years, Hamel and Shreya have played a major role in shift=
ing evals from being an obscure, confusing subject to one of the most neces=
sary skills for AI product builders.

roduct breaks, build robust evals you can trust, and create a continuous im=
provement flywheel that catches regressions before they ship.

, make-or-break skill for product managers. This article provides the next =
step: a playbook for building an evaluation system to drive real product im=
provements. Many teams build eval dashboards that look useful but are ultim=
ately ignored and don=E2=80=99t lead to better products, because the metric=
s these evals report are disconnected from real user problems.
This guide provides a process to bridge that trust gap. We will cover three=
 phases: discovering what to measure through rigorous error analysis, build=
ing a reliable evaluation suite, and operationalizing that suite to create =
a flywheel of continuous improvement.
Phase 1: Ground your evals in reality, with error analysis
Before you can improve your AI product, you must understand how it fails. T=
he surface area for what you could evaluate is infinite. The most common mi=
stake is to start by measuring ready-made [ https://substack.com/redirect/8=

s that tells you where to focus is referred to as =E2=80=9Cerror analysis=
=E2=80=9D and should result in a clean and prioritized list of your product=
=E2=80=99s most common failure modes.
The process begins not with metrics but with data and a single human expert=
=2E For most small to medium-size compa=
nies, the most effective approach is t=
o designate a single principal domain expert as the arbiter of quality. Thi=
s person=E2=80=94a psychologist for a mental health chatbot, a lawyer for l=
egal document analysis=E2=80=94becomes the definitive voice on quality. App=
ointing a single expert, sometimes called a =E2=80=9Cbenevolent dictator,=
=E2=80=9D provides a consistent and deeply informed signal, which eliminate=
s annotation conflicts and prevents the paralysis that can come from having=
 too many cooks in the kitchen. In many situations, the product manager is =
the principal domain expert. Larger organizations, or products that span mu=
ltiple complex domains with different cultural contexts, may require multip=
le annotators. In those cases, you must implement a more structured process=
 to ensure that judgments are consistent, which involves measuring their ag=
reement.
Your next step is to arm this expert with a representative set of around 10=
0 user interactions. As you get more sophisticated, you can sample interact=
ions that are more likely to yield insights based on data analysis. Example=
s include traces that have negative user feedback, outliers in conversation=
 length, number of tools, and high latency. However, start with random samp=
ling to develop your intuition in the beginning.
With a dataset ready, the analysis begins with open coding. This is essenti=
ally like journaling, but with a bit of structuring. The domain expert revi=
ews each user interaction and writes a free-form critique on anything that =
seems wrong or undesirable, as well as giving a pass/fail judgment on the A=
I performance.
For passes, we explain why the AI succeeded in meeting the user=E2=80=99s p=
rimary need, even if there were critical aspects that could be improved. We=
 highlight these areas for enhancement while justifying the overall passing=
 judgment.
For fails, we identify the critical elements that led to the failure, expla=
ining why the AI did not meet the user=E2=80=99s main objective or compromi=
sed important factors, like user experience or security.
Here is a screenshot of open coding in action in response to an apartment l=
easing assistant. In the interface, we can see that the AI has hallucinated=
 a virtual tour when that isn=E2=80=99t something that is offered:
As a heuristic, the critique should be detailed enough for a brand-new empl=
oyee at your company to understand it. Or, if this is more helpful, so that=
 you can use it in a few-shot prompt for an LLM judge. Being too terse is a=
 common mistake. Here are some good examples of open coding in action:
Note that the example user interactions with the AI are simplified for brev=
ity=E2=80=94but you might need to give the domain expert more context to ma=
ke a judgment. More on that later.
This lightly constrained process is crucial for discovering problems you di=
dn=E2=80=99t know you had. It=E2=80=99s also where teams often discover wha=
t they truly want from their AI system. Research shows [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/4ee360e9-c72e-46b5-b45f-c8d47bd42662?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] that people are not very good a=
t specifying their complete requirements for an AI up front. It is through =
the process of reviewing outputs and articulating what feels =E2=80=9Cwrong=
=E2=80=9D that the true criteria for success emerge.
After collecting notes on dozens of traces, the next step is axial coding, =
or pattern-finding. The expert reads through all the open-ended critiques a=
nd starts grouping them (examples below). This process transforms a chaotic=
 list of observations into a clean, prioritized taxonomy of concrete failur=
e modes. It is part art and part science: group errors in a way that is man=
ageable and sensible for your domain. Here is how you might apply axial cod=
ing to the failures above:
This grouping process often happens in a spreadsheet or a dedicated annotat=
ion tool where you can tag or label each critique. When I was working on th=
is apartment leasing assistant in a real-life scenario [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/786bb392-4734-4dbc-a511-43d739f25025?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], here are the categories that e=
merged:
Conversation flow issues (missing context, awkward responses)
Handoff failures (not recognizing when to transfer to humans)
Rescheduling problems (struggling with date handling)
You can accelerate this process with an LLM. You can use an LLM to perform =
a first-pass categorization on the critiques. However, a common trap is to =
over-automate. Always have the human expert review and validate the LLM=E2=
=80=99s suggestions. An LLM might miss the nuance that distinguishes a conv=
ersation flow issue from a handoff failure. Another trap is creating too ma=
ny categories; aim for a manageable set of under 10 primary failure modes t=
hat capture the most significant problems. The goal is to create a useful t=
axonomy that you can analyze, not an exhaustive list.
The final product of this phase is to simply count the categories so you ca=
n get a sense of how to invest your time. Here is how this count looks for =
the apartment leasing assistant, which I calculated with a pivot table in a=
 spreadsheet:
As you can see, the most frequently occurring errors were conversation flow=
, handoff (to a human), and rescheduling appointments. This data gives us c=
oncrete problems specific to our product to focus on as we build evals.
A warning about off-the-shelf metrics
While off-the-shelf metrics like hallucination and toxicity are not worth p=
aying attention to directly, they can be used in creative ways. Instead of =
reporting a hallucination or toxicity score on a dashboard, calculate the s=
cores on your traces and sort them by high/low score. Reviewing the highest=
 and lowest scoring examples can reveal surprising failure modes or unexpec=
ted successes, which in turn helps you build custom evaluators for the patt=
erns you discover. This is one of the only appropriate uses for off-the-she=
lf metrics. Note that this is an advanced technique and should be done only=
 after you master the basic approach.
Phase 2: Build out your evaluation suite
After error analysis, you will have a prioritized list of your product=E2=
=80=99s most common failures. The next step is to build a suite of automate=
d evaluators to track them. The goal is to create a system that is reliable=
, cost-effective, and trusted by your team. This requires choosing the righ=
t tool for each failure mode.
Your choice of tools comes down to one question for each prioritized failur=
e mode on your list: Is this failure objective and rule-based (for example:=
 =E2=80=9CDoes the output contain a user ID?=E2=80=9D), or is it subjective=
 and requiring judgment (example: =E2=80=9CWas the tone appropriate for the=
 persona?=E2=80=9D)?
For objective failures, use code-based evaluators. These are simple checks =
written as code, like assertions in a unit test. They are fast, cheap, and =
deterministic, making them perfect for verifying things like whether an out=
put is valid JSON, contains a required keyword, or executes without error. =
Use them whenever a clear rule can define success or failure.
For subjective failures, you=E2=80=99ll need to build an LLM-as-a-judge to =
reliably assess qualities that code cannot easily handle, like tone, releva=
nce, or reasoning quality. This can be a rigorous process=E2=80=94as is tra=
ining any LLM=E2=80=94but it is the only way to scale nuanced and subjectiv=
e evaluations and ultimately improve your product. The good news is that th=
ere is a scientific approach to making sure the judge is sufficiently align=
ed with your product vision and success criteria.
The LLM-as-a-judge playbook
This is not about writing a clever prompt. It is about a systematic process=
 of grounding an LLM=E2=80=99s judgment in your specific quality bar. The o=
utput is an LLM that gives you a binary pass/fail metric for specific error=
(s). More importantly, you need to trust the metric. The way to establish t=
rust is by measuring the judge against a human-labeled dataset you create. =
There are two steps involved. The first is to create a dataset that establi=
shes ground truth:
1. Establish ground truth
Your evaluation system is only as good as its source of truth. For most tea=
ms, the most effective approach is to leverage the principal domain expert =
we mentioned earlier. While larger organizations operating across multiple =
domains may require multiple annotators and processes to measure inter-anno=
tator agreement, starting with a single expert accelerates the process.
The expert=E2=80=99s task is to provide two things for every user interacti=
on with your AI, grouped by session: a binary pass/fail judgment and a deta=
iled critique. Many teams are tempted to use a 1-to-5 Likert scale, believi=
ng it captures more nuance. This is a trap. The distinction between a =E2=
=80=9C3=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9C4=E2=80=9D is subjective and inconsistent. =
Binary decisions force clarity. An output either meets the quality bar or i=
t does not. The nuance is not lost; it is captured in the critique, which e=
xplains why a judgment was made. These critiques are the secret ingredient =
for building a high-fidelity judge. For example, consider this example from=
 earlier:
Reasonable people may disagree on whether or not this is =E2=80=9Cgood enou=
gh.=E2=80=9D However, it is important that you strive toward making a judgm=
ent call on what is good and bad for your product. In this case, we decided=
 that this interaction was a failure.
2. Build and validate the judge
After you have collected the ground-truth data labeled by your domain exper=
t, you are ready to build and validate the judge. Do not use your entire da=
taset to build and test your judge. This leads to overfitting, where you it=
erate toward performing well on examples you observe but fail on new, unsee=
n data.
Instead, split the ground-truth data into three distinct sets:
Train set (10%=E2=80=9320%): A small set of clear examples, including the e=
xpert=E2=80=99s critiques, to use in the judge=E2=80=99s prompt
Dev set (40%=E2=80=9345%): A larger set used to iteratively test and refine=
 the judge=E2=80=99s prompt
Test set (40%=E2=80=9345%): A held-out set, untouched during development, f=
or a final, unbiased measurement of the judge=E2=80=99s performance
This process of refining your judge=E2=80=99s prompt on the dev set is a me=
ta-evaluation task. You are evaluating your evaluator. It is also where you=
 will discover the nuances of your own quality bar. As research [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/4ee360e9-c72e-46b5-b45f-c8d47bd42662?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=
TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] on =E2=80=9Ccriteria d=
rift=E2=80=9D has shown, the process of reviewing LLM outputs and aligning =
a judge helps you articulate and refine your own standards.
Below is a visualization of this LLM-as-a-judge alignment process at a high=
 level.
3. Measure what matters: TPR/TNR over accuracy
A common impulse is to measure a judge=E2=80=99s performance with a single =
accuracy score, but this can be dangerously misleading. Imagine an AI syste=
m that succeeds 99% of the time. A judge that always predicts =E2=80=9Cpass=
=E2=80=9D will be 99% accurate, but it will never catch a single failure. T=
his is a common issue with imbalanced datasets, where one outcome is far mo=
re frequent than the other.
Instead of accuracy, the true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (T=
NR) measured together will tell you precisely how your judge is likely to m=
ake mistakes. In plain language:
TPR: Of all the examples that should pass, what percentage did the judge co=
rrectly label as =E2=80=9Cpass=E2=80=9D?
TNR: Of all the examples that should fail, what percentage did the judge co=
rrectly label as =E2=80=9Cfail=E2=80=9D?
A judge with a high TPR but low TNR is good at recognizing success but lets=
 failures slip through. The acceptable tradeoff depends on your product. Fo=
r an AI providing medical advice, a false negative (failing to catch a harm=
ful suggestion) is far more costly than a false positive. For a creative wr=
iting assistant, a false positive (flagging a good response as bad) might b=
e worse, as it could stifle creativity.
Once you know your judge=E2=80=99s TPR and TNR, you can even statistically =
correct its raw scores to get a more accurate estimate of your system=E2=80=
=99s true failure rate. For example, if your judge reports a 95% pass rate =
on 1,000 new examples but you know it has a 10% chance of mislabeling a fai=
lure as a pass, you can adjust that 95% score to reflect the judge=E2=80=99=
s known error rate. (The mathematical details for this correction will be i=
n an appendix).
This rigorous, human-led validation process is the only way to build an eva=
luation system your team can rely on. When you present a dashboard showing =
a 5% failure rate for a critical feature, your stakeholders need to believe=
 that number reflects reality. This process is how you build that trust.
Considerations for specific architectures
There are special considerations and strategies to keep in mind when design=
ing evals for multi-turn conversations, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflow=
s. We address each of them below.
Multi-turn conversations
Many AI products are conversational, which introduces the challenge of main=
taining context over time. When evaluating conversations, start at the high=
est level: Did the entire session achieve the user=E2=80=99s goal? This ses=
sion-level pass/fail judgment is the most important measure of success.
When a conversation fails, the next step is to isolate the root cause. A co=
mmon mistake is to assume the failure is due to the complexities of dialogu=
e. Before you dive into multi-turn analysis, try to reproduce the failure i=
n a single turn. For example, if a shopping bot gives the wrong return poli=
cy on the fourth turn, first ask it directly: =E2=80=9CWhat is the return p=
olicy for product X1000?=E2=80=9D If it still fails, the problem is likely =
a simple knowledge or retrieval issue. If it succeeds, you have confirmed t=
he failure is conversational=E2=80=94the bot is losing context or misinterp=
reting information from earlier in the dialogue. This diagnostic step saves=
 significant time by distinguishing simple knowledge gaps from true convers=
ational memory failures.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
A RAG system is a two-part machine: a retriever finds information, and a ge=
nerator writes an answer using that information. These two parts can fail i=
ndependently, and an end-to-end correctness score will not tell you which o=
ne is broken. You must evaluate them separately.
First, evaluate the retriever. Treat it as a search problem. To do this, yo=
u need a dataset of queries paired with their known correct documents. The =
most critical metric for RAG is often recall@k. This measures what percenta=
ge of all the truly relevant documents are captured within the top k result=
s your system retrieves. Recall is paramount because if the correct informa=
tion is not retrieved, the generator has no chance of producing a correct a=
nswer. Modern LLMs are surprisingly adept at ignoring irrelevant noise in t=
heir context, but they cannot invent facts from missing information.
The value of k is a critical tuning parameter that depends on your task. Fo=
r a simple query requiring a single fact, like =E2=80=9CWhat are the proper=
ty taxes for 123 Main St.?,=E2=80=9D a small k (e.g. 3 to 5) is often suffi=
cient. The main goal is to ensure that the one correct document is retrieve=
d. However, for a complex query that requires synthesizing information from=
 multiple sources, such as =E2=80=9CSummarize recent market trends for 3-be=
droom houses in downtown,=E2=80=9D you'll need a larger k (e.g. 10 to 20) t=
o provide the generator with enough context to build a comprehensive answer=
=2E While recall is the priority for th=
e initial retrieval stage, precision@k=
 (the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant) becomes important =
in systems with a second, re-ranking stage designed to select the best few =
documents to pass to the LLM.
Once your retriever is performing well on a diverse set of queries, you can=
 evaluate the generator. Here you are primarily measuring two things. First=
 is faithfulness: does the generated answer stick to the facts provided in =
the retrieved context, or is it hallucinating? Second is answer relevance: =
does the answer directly address the user=E2=80=99s original question? An a=
nswer can be perfectly faithful to the source documents but still fail to b=
e relevant to the user=E2=80=99s intent.
Fix your retriever first. Only when you are confident that the right inform=
ation is consistently being fed to your generator should you focus heavily =
on improving the generation step. It should be noted that RAG is a very nas=
cent topic, and there is still much to be explored in terms of evaluating a=
nd optimizing it. See this series [ https://substack.com/redirect/bc364ce7-=
f45f-40e2-9989-d66dd95864f7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for an exploration of advanced RAG topics.
Agentic workflows
Agents=E2=80=94which can execute a sequence of actions, like tool calls, to=
 accomplish a goal=E2=80=94are the most complex systems to evaluate. A sing=
le pass/fail judgment on the final outcome is a good start, but it is not d=
iagnostic. When an agent fails, you need to know which step in the chain of=
 reasoning broke.
For this, a transition failure matrix is an invaluable tool. Think of an ag=
ent=E2=80=99s workflow as a series of states or steps, like an assembly lin=
e. The agent moves from one state (e.g. generating_sql) to the next (e.g. e=
xecuting_sql). A transition failure matrix is a chart that shows you exactl=
y where the assembly line breaks down most often.
The rows of the matrix represent the last successful step, and the columns =
represent the step where the failure occurred. By analyzing traces of faile=
d agent interactions and mapping them onto this matrix, you can quickly spo=
t hotspots. Instead of guessing, you can see with data that, for example, y=
our agent fails most often when trying to execute the SQL it just generated=
, or when it misinterprets the output from a tool call. This transforms the=
 overwhelming task of debugging a complex agent into a focused, data-driven=
 investigation.
With these targeted evaluation strategies for complex systems, you are now =
ready to operationalize your full evaluation suite.

ften leads to tracking scores that don=E2=80=99t correlate with the actual =
problems your users face with your product. You cannot know what to measure=
 until you systematically find out how your product fails in specific conte=
xts. The process that tells you where to focus is referred to as =E2=80=9Ce=
rror analysis=E2=80=9D and should result in a clean and prioritized list of=
 your product=E2=80=99s most common failure modes.</span></p><p style=3D"ma=

he process begins not with metrics but with data and a single human expert.=
 For most small to medium-size companies, the most effective approach is to=
 designate a single principal domain expert as the arbiter of quality. This=
 person=E2=80=94a psychologist for a mental health chatbot, a lawyer for le=
gal document analysis=E2=80=94becomes the definitive voice on quality. Appo=
inting a single expert, sometimes called a =E2=80=9Cbenevolent dictator,=E2=
=80=9D provides a consistent and deeply informed signal, which eliminates a=
nnotation conflicts and prevents the paralysis that can come from having to=
o many cooks in the kitchen. In many situations, the product manager is the=
 principal domain expert. Larger organizations, or products that span multi=
ple complex domains with different cultural contexts, may require multiple =
annotators. In those cases, you must implement a more structured process to=
 ensure that judgments are consistent, which involves measuring their agree=
ment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">Your next step is to arm this expert with a represent=
ative set of around 100 user interactions. As you get more sophisticated, y=
ou can sample interactions that are more likely to yield insights based on =
data analysis. Examples include traces that have negative user feedback, ou=
tliers in conversation length, number of tools, and high latency. However, =
start with random sampling to develop your intuition in the beginning.</p><=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;"><span>A common impulse is to measure a judge=E2=80=99s performance wit=
h a single accuracy score, but this can be dangerously misleading. Imagine =
an AI system that succeeds 99% of the time. A judge that always predicts =
=E2=80=9Cpass=E2=80=9D will be 99% accurate, but it will never catch a sing=
le failure. This is a common issue with </span><strong>imbalanced datasets<=
/strong><span>, where one outcome is far more frequent than the other.</spa=
n></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=

 26px;font-size: 16px;">A judge with a high TPR but low TNR is good at reco=
gnizing success but lets failures slip through. The acceptable tradeoff dep=
ends on your product. For an AI providing medical advice, a false negative =
(failing to catch a harmful suggestion) is far more costly than a false pos=
itive. For a creative writing assistant, a false positive (flagging a good =
response as bad) might be worse, as it could stifle creativity.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Once you know your judge=E2=80=99s TPR and TNR, you can even statistic=
ally correct its raw scores to get a more accurate estimate of your system=
=E2=80=99s true failure rate. For example, if your judge reports a 95% pass=
 rate on 1,000 new examples but you know it has a 10% chance of mislabeling=
 a failure as a pass, you can adjust that 95% score to reflect the judge=E2=
=80=99s known error rate. (The mathematical details for this correction wil=
l be in an appendix).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=

lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">There are special co=
nsiderations and strategies to keep in mind when designing evals for multi-=
turn conversations, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows. We address each o=
f them below.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Many AI products are conversational, which introduces the chal=
lenge of maintaining context over time. When evaluating conversations, star=
t at the highest level: Did the entire session achieve the user=E2=80=99s g=
oal? This session-level pass/fail judgment is the most important measure of=
 success.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When a conversation fails, the next step is to is=
olate the root cause. A common mistake is to assume the failure is due to t=
he complexities of dialogue. Before you dive into multi-turn analysis, try =
to reproduce the failure in a single turn. For example, if a shopping bot g=
ives the wrong return policy on the fourth turn, first ask it directly: =E2=
=80=9CWhat is the return policy for product X1000?=E2=80=9D If it still fai=
ls, the problem is likely a simple knowledge or retrieval issue. If it succ=
eeds, you have confirmed the failure is conversational=E2=80=94the bot is l=
osing context or misinterpreting information from earlier in the dialogue. =
This diagnostic step saves significant time by distinguishing simple knowle=
dge gaps from true conversational memory failures.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=

is a two-part machine: a retriever finds information, and a generator write=
s an answer using that information. These two parts can fail independently,=
 and an end-to-end correctness score will not tell you which one is broken.=
 You must evaluate them separately.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

o do this, you need a dataset of queries paired with their known correct do=
cuments. The most critical metric for RAG is often </span><strong>recall@k<=
/strong><span>. This measures what percentage of all the truly relevant doc=
uments are captured within the top </span><em>k</em><span> results your sys=
tem retrieves. Recall is paramount because if the correct information is no=
t retrieved, the generator has no chance of producing a correct answer. Mod=
ern LLMs are surprisingly adept at ignoring irrelevant noise in their conte=
xt, but they cannot invent facts from missing information.</span></p><p sty=

16px;"><span>The value of </span><em>k</em><span> is a critical tuning para=
meter that depends on your task. For a simple query requiring a single fact=
, like =E2=80=9CWhat are the property taxes for 123 Main St.?,=E2=80=9D a s=
mall </span><em>k</em><span> (e.g. 3 to 5) is often sufficient. The main go=
al is to ensure that the one correct document is retrieved. However, for a =
complex query that requires synthesizing information from multiple sources,=
 such as =E2=80=9CSummarize recent market trends for 3-bedroom houses in do=
wntown,=E2=80=9D you'll need a larger </span><em>k</em><span> (e.g. 10 to 2=
0) to provide the generator with enough context to build a comprehensive an=
swer. While recall is the priority for the initial retrieval stage, </span>=
<strong>precision@k</strong><span> (the fraction of retrieved documents tha=
t are relevant) becomes important in systems with a second, re-ranking stag=
e designed to select the best few documents to pass to the LLM.</span></p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;"><span>Once your retriever is performing well on a diverse set o=
f queries, you can evaluate the </span><strong>generator</strong><span>. He=
re you are primarily measuring two things. First is </span><strong>faithful=
ness</strong><span>: does the generated answer stick to the facts provided =
in the retrieved context, or is it hallucinating? Second is </span><strong>=
answer relevance</strong><span>: does the answer directly address the user=
=E2=80=99s original question? An answer can be perfectly faithful to the so=
