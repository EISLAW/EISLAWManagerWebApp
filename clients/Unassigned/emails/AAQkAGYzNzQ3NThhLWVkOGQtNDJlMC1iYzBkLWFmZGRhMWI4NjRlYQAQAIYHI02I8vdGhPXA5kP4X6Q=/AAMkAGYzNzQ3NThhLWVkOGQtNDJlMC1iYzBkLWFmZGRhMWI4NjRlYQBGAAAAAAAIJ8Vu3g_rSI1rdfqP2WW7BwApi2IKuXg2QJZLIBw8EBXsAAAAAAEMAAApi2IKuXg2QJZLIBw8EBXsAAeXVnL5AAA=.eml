GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: FREE SPEECH AND THE INTERNET [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
THE INTERNET TODAY [4]
Oct. 16, 2025
_Question: __Anonymity does create problems, but I do NOT agree that the technologists who created the internet are now publishing companies._
Response: A commercial publisher is anyone who distributes the writings of others for a profit. There are publishers who distribute writings without profit – as a public service, for example. The
usual form of the publication is the book, but the essence of publishing is the distribution of writings such as books, magazines, but also other things such as sheet music. Some authors self-publish
books through publishers that they pay for the service. These publishers sometimes provide editors, but they distribute the material through their channels for a profit.
This is what the internet does. The corporation owning the platform provides users with a publication and distribution system in order to make a profit. Most do not offer editorial services, which
does not mean they do not distribute the writing and thought of others for a profit. Many things that had been done by humans in the past are now done by machines and computers. But the distribution
of writing is the act of publishing, whether through bookstores or online without providing any editorial service. They allow writers to access readers. Just because they provide technologies to
distribute it does not change the nature of the business.
-------------------------
_Question: Given the number of governments that suppress free speech, there has to be a place for anonymity._
Response: There are two problems with this view, from my point of view. The first is that in countries where there is censorship, there is the possibility that computers might be seized and the writer
taken away. This is far from certain, but in these countries prudent people know to take care of what they distribute. There is also a massive problem with anonymity: slander. On the internet it is
easy to write untrue things meant to damage the reputation of another. Public figures in many places do not have the right in most circumstances to file a civil suit against the sender. But the
ordinary citizen who is slandered has the right to take civil action against the slanderer. This protection is essential in charging a person of (insert your favorite depravity) with said depravity.
If there is anonymity, then on the internet claims against you, for example, could be widely distributed without legal recourse. This could be done in ways that could not be traced to the source even
with the cooperation of the system of distribution. There have been cases relevant to this. So while I understand the threat in oppressive nations, the threat to reputation, the heart of the libel
laws, is a very great threat on the internet, given anonymity. I would say on balance that this threat is more likely and I think more common than the other, where the dangers are well understood.
-------------------------
_Question: __An excellent statement of the ills that the internet has foisted upon us, but identity would drive away 90 percent (99 percent?) of internet users. Not a bad thing but huge corporations
are making gigantic sums of money off of aberrant behavior. Don’t you think they would lobby to defeat such a proposition if an attempt was made to legislate one?_
Response: If most users on the internet would not be there if they had to take responsibility for what they write, we should take a very careful look at the dangers that the internet poses. A better
solution would be holding the publisher responsible for monitoring his technology – in other words, by editing what is said. This would be a super opportunity for artificial intelligence to prove me
wrong about its limits.
-------------------------
_Question: __Anonymity is not the enemy of free speech – it’s often what makes genuine expression possible. The essence of free speech is speaking and standing by what you say. Don’t you think
that accountability should focus on unlawful content, not on revealing identity?_
Response: The right to speech is a fundamental legal right in free nations. In my mind there is also responsibility in decent society to take responsibility for what you say. The nasty whisper, the
false accusation, the claim of the other’s depravity, when untrue, is not protected in a free country, as it is not in the United States. What makes a decent society is a citizenry that says what it
means and stands behind what it says. I have a suspicion that when the founders added free speech to the Constitution, they had in mind the decency and courage to stand by what was said. If you have
something to say but do not want to be identified for saying it, I strongly suspect that you are about to say something you shouldn’t. The principle of free speech and the willingness to hear a
response or a counterargument are in my mind linked. There is the right to free speech and then the moral practice of it, pompous as that sounds.
-------------------------
_Question: You sound like an old lady. Whenever something new comes along, there are always older people to say how terrible it is. _
Response: The internet is not a new technology. It was first introduced in the 1960s by the Department of Defense and was called ARPANET, for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, and was used
for rapid communications between DoD research centers. The first public internet services were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s with services companies such as Prodigy and CompuServe and
the World Wide Web in 1991. So the technology is about 60 years old. The first commercial use was about 35 years ago. So if I sound like an old lady, you... (deleted by my wife).
-------------------------
_Question: __You wrote: “But this is very far from the worst division in American history. I would think Lincoln’s election that led to civil war was a couple notches above this. The division in
the Great Depression was far graver than this. The division in the 1970s over race and the Vietnam War, both frequently violent, was pretty bad. So I do not see the current division as particularly
worrisome. If we could get together after the Civil War, the Great Depression, and the 1960s, we will get through this.” _
_All the examples you cite occurred when the U.S. empire was still expanding. The growing economy made it possible to “buy peace.” Today’s economy is more win-lose, with competing elites
fighting over relatively scarcer resources. _
Response: I do not mean to dismiss your point, but I have to say that there is a constant dimension of American culture that makes the assumption that the United States is past its prime. By any
measure it is not. The fact is that the American GDP is one-quarter of the world’s economy, and that number is stable (and extraordinary). To call that decline would be like saying that if Rome did
not occupy another region each year it would be in decline. I know decline. The Chinese are far more worried about us than we are about them. That’s why they parade all of their new military
technologies for the world to see, while we evolve in secret. I could go on this way, but the point I am making is that as I travel the world, the fundamental question citizens of every nation seem
obsessed with is what will the United States do next. There is a belief in America, a constant feature of American history, that our best days are over. This is not the perception I find in other
countries, except as hopes and prayers. Nor does America ever use the term “empire,” because we are not one. We are too indifferent to the world to be an empire. The United States’ culture is to
be both self-obsessed and profoundly self-critical. So I, with passion, must take issue with the assumption that remaining one-quarter of the world’s economy and not advancing to 30 percent means
decline. But then this is an American tradition, vastly underestimating our power.
-------------------------
_Question: __But before you publish your book, you DO get the input of your publisher and editor. And before you wrote your draft, you bounced those ideas off colleagues, friends and family. Through
all these means, you developed and sharpened your thoughts. You are not held accountable for these conversations. You could have said some stupid things – things you later changed your mind on as
conversations continued. Those conversations are not preserved forever and broadcast to the world. They served a valuable function in preparing you to say responsibly in book form what you eventually
wrote._
Response: Publishers distribute books written by authors. Publishers are also responsible for the books they sell, and can be sued for publishing libel, or simply held in contempt for allowing trash
to be sold. The owners of the internet are publishers who distribute what is written. Yet they take no responsibility for what they distribute and do not employ editors. They become wealthy
nonetheless. They distribute the thoughts of others, do not edit out the trash, and claim they are not responsible for any of this. I hold them responsible, but then, who am I?

Oct. 16, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>Anonymity does create problems,&nbsp;but I do NOT agree that the techn=
ologists who created the internet are now publishing companies.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: A commer=
cial publisher is anyone who distributes the writings of others for a profi=
t. There are publishers who distribute writings without profit =E2=80=93 as=
 a public service, for example. The usual form of the publication is the bo=
ok, but the essence of publishing is the distribution of writings such as b=
ooks, magazines, but also other things such as sheet music. Some authors se=
lf-publish books through publishers that they pay for the service. These pu=
blishers sometimes provide editors, but they distribute the material throug=
h their channels for a profit.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This is what the i=
nternet does. The corporation owning the platform provides users with a pub=
lication and distribution system in order to make a profit. Most do not off=
er editorial services, which does not mean they do not distribute the writi=
ng and thought of others for a profit. Many things that had been done by hu=
mans in the past are now done by machines and computers. But the distributi=
on of writing is the act of publishing, whether through bookstores or onlin=
e without providing any editorial service. They allow writers to access rea=
ders. Just because they provide technologies to distribute it does not chan=
ge the nature of the business.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Give=
n the number of governments that suppress free speech, there has to be a pl=
ace for anonymity.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: There ar=
e two problems with this view, from my point of view. The first is that in =
countries where there is censorship, there is the possibility that computer=
s might be seized and the writer taken away. This is far from certain, but =
in these countries prudent people know to take care of what they distribute=
. There is also a massive problem with anonymity: slander. On the internet =
it is easy to write untrue things meant to damage the reputation of another=
. Public figures in many places do not have the right in most circumstances=
 to file a civil suit against the sender. But the ordinary citizen who is s=
landered has the right to take civil action against the slanderer. This pro=
tection is essential in charging a person of (insert your favorite depravit=
y) with said depravity. If there is anonymity, then on the internet claims =
against you, for example, could be widely distributed without legal recours=
e. This could be done in ways that could not be traced to the source even w=
ith the cooperation of the system of distribution. There have been cases re=
levant to this. So while I understand the threat in oppressive nations, the=
 threat to reputation, the heart of the libel laws, is a very great threat =
on the internet, given anonymity. I would say on balance that this threat i=
s more likely and I think more common than the other, where the dangers are=
 well understood.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>An excellent statement of the ills that the internet has foisted upon =
us, but identity would drive away 90 percent (99 percent?) of internet user=
s. Not a bad thing but huge corporations are making gigantic sums of money =
off of aberrant behavior. Don=E2=80=99t you think they would lobby to defea=
t such a proposition if an attempt was made to legislate one?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: If most =
users on the internet would not be there if they had to take responsibility=
 for what they write, we should take a very careful look at the dangers tha=
t the internet poses. A better solution would be holding the publisher resp=
onsible for monitoring his technology =E2=80=93 in other words, by editing =
what is said. This would be a super opportunity for artificial intelligence=
 to prove me wrong about its limits.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>Anonymity is not the enemy of free speech =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s often=
 what makes genuine expression possible. The essence of free speech is spea=
king and standing by what you say. Don=E2=80=99t you think that accountabil=
ity should focus on unlawful content, not on revealing identity?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The righ=
t to speech is a fundamental legal right in free nations. In my mind there =
is also responsibility in decent society to take responsibility for what yo=
u say. The nasty whisper, the false accusation, the claim of the other=E2=
=80=99s depravity, when untrue, is not protected in a free country, as it i=
s not in the United States. What makes a decent society is a citizenry that=
 says what it means and stands behind what it says. I have a suspicion that=
 when the founders added free speech to the Constitution, they had in mind =
the decency and courage to stand by what was said. If you have something to=
 say but do not want to be identified for saying it, I strongly suspect tha=
t you are about to say something you shouldn=E2=80=99t. The principle of fr=
ee speech and the willingness to hear a response or a counterargument are i=
n my mind linked. There is the right to free speech and then the moral prac=
tice of it, pompous as that sounds.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: You =
sound like an old lady. Whenever something new comes along, there are alway=
s older people to say how terrible it is. </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The inte=
rnet is not a new technology. It was first introduced in the 1960s by the D=
epartment of Defense and was called ARPANET, for Advanced Research Projects=
 Agency Network, and was used for rapid communications between DoD research=
 centers. The first public internet services were introduced in the late 19=
80s and early 1990s with services companies such as Prodigy and CompuServe =
and the World Wide Web in 1991. So the technology is about 60 years old. Th=
e first commercial use was about 35 years ago. So if I sound like an old la=
dy, you... (deleted by my wife).</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>You wrote: =E2=80=9CBut this is very far from the worst division in Am=
erican history. I would think Lincoln=E2=80=99s election that led to civil =
war was a couple notches above this. The division in the Great Depression w=
as far graver than this. The division in the 1970s over race and the Vietna=
m War, both frequently violent, was pretty bad. So I do not see the current=
 division as particularly worrisome. If we could get together after the Civ=
il War, the Great Depression, and the 1960s, we will get through this.=E2=
=80=9D </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>All the exampl=
es you cite occurred when the U.S. empire&nbsp;was still expanding. The gro=
wing economy made it possible to&nbsp;=E2=80=9Cbuy peace.=E2=80=9D Today=E2=
=80=99s economy is&nbsp;more win-lose, with competing elites fighting over =
relatively scarcer resources.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I do not=
 mean to dismiss your point, but I have to say that there is a constant dim=
ension of American culture that makes the assumption that the United States=
 is past its prime. By any measure it is not. The fact is that the American=
 GDP is one-quarter of the world=E2=80=99s economy, and that number is stab=
le (and extraordinary). To call that decline would be like saying that if R=
ome did not occupy another region each year it would be in decline. I know =
decline. The Chinese are far more worried about us than we are about them. =
That=E2=80=99s why they parade all of their new military technologies for t=
he world to see, while we evolve in secret. I could go on this way, but the=
 point I am making is that as I travel the world, the fundamental question =
citizens of every nation seem obsessed with is what will the United States =
do next. There is a belief in America, a constant feature of American histo=
ry, that our best days are over. This is not the perception I find in other=
 countries, except as hopes and prayers. Nor does America ever use the term=
 =E2=80=9Cempire,=E2=80=9D because we are not one. We are too indifferent t=
o the world to be an empire. The United States=E2=80=99 culture is to be bo=
th self-obsessed and profoundly self-critical. So I, with passion, must tak=
e issue with the assumption that remaining one-quarter of the world=E2=80=
=99s economy and not advancing to 30 percent means decline. But then this i=
s an American tradition, vastly underestimating our power.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>But before you publish your book, you DO get the input of your publish=
er and editor. And before you wrote your draft, you bounced those ideas off=
 colleagues, friends and family. Through all these means, you developed and=
 sharpened your thoughts. You are not held accountable for these conversati=
ons. You could have said some stupid things =E2=80=93 things you later chan=
ged your mind on as conversations continued. Those conversations are not pr=
eserved forever and broadcast to the world. They served a valuable function=
 in preparing you to say responsibly in book form what you eventually wrote=
.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Publishe=
rs distribute books written by authors. Publishers are also responsible for=
 the books they sell, and can be sued for publishing libel, or simply held =
in contempt for allowing trash to be sold. The owners of the internet are p=
ublishers who distribute what is written. Yet they take no responsibility f=
or what they distribute and do not employ editors. They become wealthy none=
theless. They distribute the thoughts of others, do not edit out the trash,=
 and claim they are not responsible for any of this. I hold them responsibl=
e, but then, who am I?</p>
