the best out of these tools (along with another 10,000 in numerous free onl=

when people try to use these tools in real life:
How do you make your prototypes look good enough to show customers or senio=
r stakeholders?
How do you successfully adopt these tools as a team, instead of a lot of in=
dividuals working in silos?
These common questions are the reasons product, design, and engineering tea=
ms are struggling to figure out team workflows for AI tools. Without handof=
f guidance or high-quality prototypes, AI prototyping is left to exploratio=
ns and experiments, which are hard to operationalize and scale.
In this post, I=E2=80=99ll walk you through three ways to create component =
libraries that consistently create great mocks; team workflows to reduce re=
work; and a step-by-step guide on how prototypes should be used. I=E2=80=99=

N6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] in this post, but these=
 techniques work with any AI prototyping tool.
To give you a quick example of what=E2=80=99s possible, here=E2=80=99s an A=
irbnb prototype I built with a single prompt: =E2=80=9CBuild a homepage and=
 a listing details page.=E2=80=9D
Let=E2=80=99s get started!
Component libraries
Component libraries are the first big improvement you can bring to your tea=
m. They allow you to maintain branding and consistent styling without havin=
g to manually clean up each prototype to look like your product. Building a=
 component library will take some up-front effort, but you=E2=80=99re also =
building reusable assets that will greatly improve the quality of your prot=
otypes going forward and save you time after the initial investment.
There are three different approaches to building component libraries with A=
I prototyping tools, with different advantages and tradeoffs in effort and =
output:
Screenshots
Chrome extensions
Code
Let=E2=80=99s go through each and discuss their tradeoffs.
Method 1: Screenshots
Screenshots are the easiest way to start building a component library. You =
don=E2=80=99t need any technical expertise, and this approach works with an=
y tool.
Start by prompting your favorite AI prototyping tool with the following:
You are tasked with creating a component library based on a screenshot usin=
g React, and Tailwind CSS.
All components should be custom-made to match the screenshot as closely as =
possible.
Follow these instructions carefully:
1. Analyze the provided screenshot.
2. Identify distinct UI components in the screenshot. These may include, bu=
t are not limited to, =E2=97=A6 Buttons =E2=97=A6 Input fields =E2=97=A6 Na=
vigation bars =E2=97=A6 Cards =E2=97=A6 Modals =E2=97=A6 Typography element=
s
3. For each identified component:
a. Create a React functional component.
b. Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the component, matching the visual des=
ign in the screenshot.
c. Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.
d. Add any necessary props for customization.
e. Include a brief comment describing the component=E2=80=99s purpose.
4. After creating all individual components, create an index page that impo=
rts and displays each component with example usage.
Remember to use only custom-made components and Tailwind CSS classes. Do no=
t use any external libraries or pre-built components.
Strive to match the visual design in the screenshot as closely as possible =
while maintaining good coding practices and component reusability.
Let=E2=80=99s give this a try with v0, re-creating a Google Calendar UI. Re=
member to include a screenshot!
Here=E2=80=99s our initial result:
One quick note: You may end up with a reproduction of the screenshot instea=
d of a list of components. These AI tools are very tuned to reproduce scree=
nshots, so you may need to push it with one more prompt, like =E2=80=9CInst=
ead of showing me a page that re-creates the UI, the index page should be a=
 list of components in the component library.=E2=80=9D
From here, you can continue adding more components by pasting in additional=
 screenshots with the prompt =E2=80=9CAdd these components as well.=E2=80=
=9D If you want to refine the components, I recommend starting with this pr=
ompt:
=E2=80=9CList the differences between the screenshot and your implementatio=
n. How can you match the design more exactly? Don=E2=80=99t code.=E2=80=9D
This technique (called reflection) makes it easy to leverage the AI to quic=
kly make UX improvements.
Once you have your component library complete, pause! You=E2=80=99ll want t=
o create a fork of the project and start to use your components in a new pr=
oject. Your forked project will automatically reuse your components to asse=
mble your design like Legos. Again, this technique works in any of your fav=
orite AI prototyping tools. (Here=E2=80=99s how to create a fork in each AI=
 prototyping tool: Bolt [ https://substack.com/redirect/a78103ba-7d50-42d4-=

Ow0 ].)
For example, we can prototype an AI agent in Google Calendar that blocks de=
ep-work slots with a simple prompt like =E2=80=9CCreate a Google Calendar m=
ain page view that has an AI scheduling assistant to recommend deep-work bl=
ocks.=E2=80=9D
Here=E2=80=99s the result:
Spending time to improve your components is worth it. Every prototype made =
using them has better visual quality, is less distracting to stakeholders, =
and allows conversations to focus on the specific elements that are being t=
ested.
Method 2: Chrome extensions
The next option for creating component libraries is to use Chrome extension=
s. As of today, Magic Patterns [ https://substack.com/redirect/60b84cd3-e82=
c-4727-9b9d-078fd9441314?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] is the only tool that supports extracting components fr=
om a webpage directly.
Using the extension is simple: Select a UI element, extract its styling, an=
d turn it into a reusable component.
I like to fire off multiple of these extracts at the same time to create as=
 many components as I can in a short period of time. Once they land in Magi=
c Patterns, you can continue to prompt your way through refinements.
The real magic comes in using these components. Let=E2=80=99s try the promp=
t =E2=80=9CBuild me a channel view of YouTube.=E2=80=9D
Here=E2=80=99s the result from a single prompt:
Method 3: Code
The last way to build a component library is with code, using your real com=
ponents. This approach requires the most effort but will provide you with p=
rototypes that are indistinguishable from your real product. You=E2=80=99ll=
 need assistance from engineering, and the overall effort and complexity wi=
ll depend on your codebase and company size. This option is most realistic =
in smaller companies or those with more technical designers and PMs.
To start, your engineering team will need to set up the repository so you c=
an run the front-end application locally without having to connect to any b=
ack-end services or databases. This can be accomplished by creating a new e=
ntry point for the client-side app that mocks up the API responses. Once yo=
u have your local environment running, you can use an AI code editor like C=
ursor or Windsurf to prototype.
Here=E2=80=99s an example of an app I=E2=80=99m working on. All of the info=
rmation you see is mocked up client-side, with no servers or databases conn=
ected.
This approach works best if you=E2=80=99re comfortable with GitHub, branche=
s, and running basic terminal commands.
Another way to leverage code to get more accurate components is with the ne=
w Figma MCP server [ https://substack.com/redirect/734d42a3-3a8b-432a-9d1d-=
712f7da7ce53?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMR=
MPOw0 ] (which just launched last week!). In case you=E2=80=99re unfamiliar=
, MCP is a protocol that allows AI agents to retrieve information or take a=
ctions in another application. In this case, we can use the Cursor agent to=
 make calls to Figma=E2=80=99s MCP server to retrieve detailed styling info=
rmation, and then transform that into components.
Figma currently supports four MCP actions:
Get Code
Get Variable Definitions
Get Image
Get Code Connect
This effectively gives Cursor the ability to autonomously take screenshots,=
 extract design tokens, and get CSS from Figma=E2=80=99s Dev Mode.
Here=E2=80=99s a quick side-by-side of a Figma design library [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/6932206d-db30-4568-8722-275e290a7ac4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and the same components =
reproduced in code.
Figma:
Code:
Here are the steps to build your components using Figma MCP:
Enable the Figma MCP server for the design you want to work with (Preferenc=
es, then Enable Dev Mode Server). This will provide you with a URL to conne=
ct to.
In Cursor, go to Settings, MCP Tools, and =E2=80=9CAdd a new MCP server.=E2=
=80=9D Paste in the URL provided by Figma.
Copy a component URL from Figma by right-clicking and selecting =E2=80=9CCo=
py as URL.=E2=80=9D
Ask Cursor to generate this as a component, and to make your index page a l=
ist of components.
So far, I=E2=80=99ve found this works best if you have existing components =
Cursor can mimic, or provide clear instructions for how the code should be =
formatted.
This option is very new but also very exciting for design teams who want to=
 leverage their existing component libraries with AI prototyping tools.
To summarize, component libraries give your team a set of shared artifacts =
that make it easy for anyone to create realistic prototypes with AI. Your c=
omponent library can be shared across your entire team, making it easy to o=
nboard new team members and maintain high-quality visuals for testing direc=
tly with customers or in meetings with senior stakeholders.
Team workflows
Now that you have components to help you create realistic prototypes in a f=
lash, let=E2=80=99s talk about team workflows. There are two workflows I wa=
nt to cover:
Baselines and forks
Product development lifecycle
Workflow 1: Baselines and forks
Baselines and forks are an extension of the component libraries strategy. W=
ith components, you=E2=80=99re giving team members a head start by providin=
g building blocks they can easily assemble into good-looking prototypes. =
=E2=80=9CBaselines=E2=80=9D go one step further, giving you a high-quality =
reproduction of your current product experience, allowing your team members=
 to more easily experiment with new ideas using simple prompts. Forks build=
 on this further, allowing you to duplicate a project and all of its conten=
ts without using any tokens, and keep you from screwing up your baseline.
This is best explained with an example.
Let=E2=80=99s say I=E2=80=99m the PM at Airbnb working on the new Experienc=
es product. This is a product that features the most unique and interesting=
 experiences around the world. Using baselines and forks, I=E2=80=99ll star=
t by reproducing the current page and then explore a few new ideas.
Creating the initial page with my component library took me about 20 minute=
s, mostly ironing out all the little details to make the prototype really l=
ook like Airbnb (see my previous guide [ https://substack.com/redirect/c742=
5a10-84db-46e9-928b-81710c59b6bc?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=
hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for advice on fine-tuning your prototypes). Her=
e=E2=80=99s how it looks:
By the way, here=E2=80=99s the real site:
Now that I have this page, I=E2=80=99ll treat it as my =E2=80=9Cbaseline.=
=E2=80=9D I won=E2=80=99t make any more changes and instead create a fork.
On the fork, I=E2=80=99ll enter a single prompt: =E2=80=9CModify this page =
so that it runs through a questionnaire to determine experiences that I wou=
ld like before showing me experiences. Maintain the Airbnb branding.=E2=80=
=9D
Here=E2=80=99s the result:
Now let=E2=80=99s test another idea: using the customer=E2=80=99s past trav=
el history to suggest relevant experiences.
Again, I create a fork from the baseline. On the new copy, I prompt, =E2=80=
=9CModify this page so it shows me experiences I would like based on my pas=
t travel history with Airbnb. For each recommendation, add a UI element tha=
t says =E2=80=98based on your trip to. . .=E2=80=9D
Here=E2=80=99s the result:
Baselines and forks are best used when you want to explore multiple differe=
nt ideas without having to rebuild the starting page each time. They provid=
e your team with another leg up in getting high-quality results quickly whe=
n using AI prototyping tools.
Workflow 2: Product development lifecycle
If you implement everything we=E2=80=99ve covered so far, you=E2=80=99ll be=
 dramatically ahead of the average AI prototyping noob. But it=E2=80=99s ve=
ry possible that your PMs or designers will still prototype in isolation. C=
reating a shared understanding for your team for when to use AI prototypes =
is just as important as knowing how to get good results.
Before we get into the product development lifecycle, I want to briefly tou=
ch on fidelity. For a long time, we=E2=80=99ve had low-fidelity scratch-pad=
 versions of UIs, and high-fidelity mocks for the polished finished product=
=2E AI prototyping introduces medium=
 fidelity=E2=80=94better than a napkin dr=
awing but still not as good as your finalized Figma mocks.
Here=E2=80=99s an example of a mid-fi mock of Reddit. At first glance, it s=
eems correct, but you=E2=80=99ll notice lots of imperfections, like two but=
tons for upvoting, too much padding on the left navigation, and the top rig=
ht navigation items being pushed in too far from the right edge.
You can also definitely create high-fi mocks with AI prototyping tools=E2=
=80=94the key is how much time and effort you put into them.
It=E2=80=99s critically important to choose the appropriate fidelity for yo=
ur prototype based on the context, and then set clear expectations with tea=
m members around that level of fidelity. For example, if you=E2=80=99re exp=
laining an interaction to an engineer, mid-fi is totally fine, and it=E2=80=
=99s a waste of time to push past that. Whereas if you=E2=80=99re pitching =
your CEO on funding a new team that will require millions in new investment=
, a functional high-fi mock is probably worth the time.
Below, I=E2=80=99ve outlined the six main steps in the product development =
lifecycle and how prototypes can be leveraged, as well as what fidelity the=
y should be and who is responsible for the prototype. I encourage you to ta=
ke this as general guidance and apply what makes sense in your own company.
Let=E2=80=99s walk through an example of the full development lifecycle for=
 a new feature at Reddit called Reddit Answers. This will be a gen AI featu=
re that allows users to ask questions and get quick answers based on past R=
eddit posts and comments.
Step 1: Discovery
Starting in Discovery, you may choose to use an AI prototyping tool to quic=
kly express an idea in medium fidelity. This is typically used only interna=
lly, and may just be between product, design, and your engineering lead. We=
 might start out with something like this, which should take only about 20 =
minutes:...

ing your real components. This approach requires the most effort but will p=
rovide you with prototypes that are indistinguishable from your real produc=
t. You=E2=80=99ll need assistance from engineering, and the overall effort =
and complexity will depend on your codebase and company size. This option i=
s most realistic in smaller companies or those with more technical designer=
s and PMs.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">To start, your engineering team will need to set=
 up the repository so you can run the front-end application locally without=
 having to connect to any back-end services or databases. This can be accom=
plished by creating a new entry point for the client-side app that mocks up=
 the API responses. Once you have your local environment running, you can u=
se an AI code editor like Cursor or Windsurf to prototype.</p><p style=3D"m=

briefly touch on fidelity. For a long time, we=E2=80=99ve had low-fidelity =
scratch-pad versions of UIs, and high-fidelity mocks for the polished finis=

lance, it seems correct, but you=E2=80=99ll notice lots of imperfections, l=
ike two buttons for upvoting, too much padding on the left navigation, and =
the top right navigation items being pushed in too far from the right edge.=

at level of fidelity. For example, if you=E2=80=99re explaining an interact=
