prompt-with-wake-words-in

So this was an unexpected gift. I learned something new in prompting this w=
eek. I didn=E2=80=99t expect it. And I am absolutely delighted.
This is a technique that lets you quickly and easily create what are effect=
ively macro shortcuts for prompts in ChatGPT. And yes, they really work. An=
d yes, they are as simple as typing a wake string or word of some kind into=
 ChatGPT.
And that=E2=80=99s it. You don=E2=80=99t have to call the whole prompt. Cha=
tGPT just knows it.=20
And best of all it=E2=80=99s easy to use this across chats (ChatGPT does it=
 automatically) and it=E2=80=99s super easy to share this with colleagues, =
so teams can use it too. I=E2=80=99ll show you how in this post, and I prom=
ise you can do this in like 10 minutes, even if you=E2=80=99re a beginner!
Subscribers get all these posts!
How I figured this out
Dan Shipper tossed off a line on X that instantly reframed how I think abou=
t ChatGPT: =E2=80=9CYou can install prompts like programs by writing them t=
o memory.=E2=80=9D [Link [ https://substack.com/redirect/1d9f484c-200c-4b06=
-b652-23844b14f10b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ]]=20
Yes I know you all think I know everything about ChatGPT, but I don=E2=80=
=99t. And what=E2=80=99s more interesting is nobody does. These are emergen=
t systems (video about that yesterday [ https://substack.com/redirect/62a28=
c87-1d64-4fde-9426-aec654ace87e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]).
For me, until I saw Dan=E2=80=99s tweet I=E2=80=99d been mentally bracketin=
g the memory tab as a quirky place for personal trivia=E2=80=94favorite aut=
hors, timezone, whatever. It was a complete concept flip for me to think of=
 it as a prompt locker: store a micro-instruction once, summon it later wit=
h a unique wake-word, and the model applies the rule only when you ask. No =
plug-ins, no wrappers, just disciplined conversation.
What=E2=80=99s great is I could test the idea in 30 seconds: saved a five-l=
ine rule called SNACK, fired the word, and watched ChatGPT spit a perfect f=
ive-word summary on command. That tiny demo convinced me we=E2=80=99re unde=
r-using the feature=E2=80=94and over-typing ourselves to death=E2=80=94beca=
use we haven=E2=80=99t systematized how to load, name, and prune these wake=
-word =E2=80=9Cprograms.=E2=80=9D
In the rest of this piece I=E2=80=99ll show you exactly how the mechanism w=
orks, the anatomy of a durable micro-rule, and a step-by-step audit to disc=
over wake-words tailored to your own workflow.
Start in 60 seconds
Here=E2=80=99s the fastest way to feel the prompt-locker trick in your own =
hands=E2=80=94think of it as a 60-second espresso shot for skeptics.
Open a fresh ChatGPT chat and paste the five-line rule below, ending with =
=E2=80=9CPlease remember this.=E2=80=9D
Wake-word SNACK =E2=86=92 Return a five-word summary of any text that follo=
ws. Only five words, no extras.
Wait for ChatGPT to answer =E2=80=9CGot it!=E2=80=9D and tell you the memor=
y was saved. That reply is your install confirmation=E2=80=94no =E2=80=9CGo=
t it,=E2=80=9D no brick.
Fire a test with a brand new chat:
SNACK: =E2=80=9CHello, world! Today is beautiful.=E2=80=9D
The model should spit back something like: Hello world beautiful day=E2=80=
=94exactly five words, zero chatter.
You just saved an instruction once and executed it on demand, zero copy-pas=
te, zero re-explaining. I=E2=80=99m thinking of these little macros as Lego=
 bricks. That tiny demo=E2=80=94thirty seconds, tops=E2=80=94is like a memo=
ry lego brick. Name it, watch it snap into place, and click it into a conve=
rsation whenever you want it.
Next up, I=E2=80=99ll open the casing and show why the Lego brick stays qui=
et until summoned, how wake-words chain, and what keeps your normal chats f=
rom turning into accidental command storms.
How does this work?
A memory brick is essentially a system-prompt fragment you write once and m=
ount on a tripwire. Under the hood it works like this:
Tokenizer hit-check =E2=80=93 When ChatGPT receives a message, it looks at =
the very first token. If that token matches any wake-word string stored in =
your memory, the model sees the memory hit and invokes the context tokens a=
round that memory.
Silent splice =E2=80=93 Before generating a reply, the service prepends the=
 saved instruction text out of memory to its internal system prompt. Think =
of it as hot-patching the runtime: the brick=E2=80=99s rules now sit above =
anything you just typed.
One-turn scope =E2=80=93 The splice lives for exactly one completion. Becau=
se the wake-word isn=E2=80=99t re-sent on the next round, the brick=E2=80=
=99s influence disappears unless you invoke it again. That=E2=80=99s why yo=
ur everyday chats stay untouched.
When bricks beat other prompting moves
One paste per teammate, instant consistency, no plugin overhead.
Why not just stuff it in custom instructions?
Look, I think Custom Instructions are cool. I wrote about them here [ https=
://substack.com/redirect/5914498e-9eff-440c-93e8-80ba1b533b6f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiN=
WtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. But this does a d=
ifferent job. Custom Instructions persist for every chat. What I=E2=80=99m =
calling memory bricks here are persisted, free, and opt-in=E2=80=94they tri=
gger only when you want them. They=E2=80=99re the sweet spot between verbos=
e copy-paste templates and heavyweight universal instructions.
Safe limits & gotchas
Cap active bricks at a reasonable number to avoid collisions; overlapping l=
ength rules are the fastest path to garbled output.
Overwrite, don=E2=80=99t append=E2=80=94multiple versions of the same brick=
 create instruction soup.
If you=E2=80=99re nervous about accidental invocation, use a non-English st=
ring or leading symbol (:TRIM, =E2=9A=A1SPEC) to dodge accidental triggers.
Next, we=E2=80=99ll mine your own chat history to surface the instructions =
you repeat most and convert them into bricks that pay rent rather than gath=
er dust.
Discovering Your Wake-Words
Most people start by directly copying a skill to learn it. That doesn=E2=80=
=99t work well here. If you copy SNACK it will gather dust. A brick only pa=
ys rent if it automates a chore you repeat. Here=E2=80=99s a five-step audi=
t that turns personal friction into durable wake-words.
Mine your chat history (10 minutes).
Scroll the last week of conversations and look at chats where you re-typed =
an instruction=E2=80=94anything like =E2=80=9Cexplain in plain English,=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9Cflag assumptions,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cformat as Jira.=E2=
=80=9D My favorite is =E2=80=9Cffs stop answering in tables=E2=80=9D to o3 =
lol=E2=80=94if it shows up three times or more, drop it into a scratch pad.
Group by outcome, not wording.
Merge near-duplicates. =E2=80=9CTighten copy,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cremove fluf=
f,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cbe concise=E2=80=9D all collapse into a single job=
: Trim language. This pruning keeps your eventual brick list short enough t=
o remember without a cheat sheet.
Draft micro-guides in a table.
Keep each instruction atomic=E2=80=94tone or length or structure, never all=
 three. Atomic bricks click together without fighting. This is one case whe=
re long prompts don=E2=80=99t help, so don=E2=80=99t try to put a massive a=
mount of weight here.=20
Stress-test the names.
Type a normal paragraph and make sure none of the words match your wake-wor=
d. If =E2=80=9CTRIM=E2=80=9D appears in everyday prose, prepend a symbol (:=
TRIM) or switch to something weird (=E2=9A=A1SNIP). Accidental triggers are=
 the fastest path to chaos.
Install, validate, prune.
Paste one brick at a time with =E2=80=9CPlease remember this.=E2=80=9D Wait=
 for =E2=80=9CGot it!=E2=80=9D and fire the test prompt from your table. If=
 output wobbles, edit the instruction and overwrite the old brick=E2=80=94n=
ever stack revisions. Review weekly: keep the bricks you used, delete the r=
est.=20
Look I don=E2=80=99t know what the best total is but something like 10ish a=
ctive bricks is maybe a healthy ceiling; beyond that the mental lookup cost=
 outweighs the keystroke savings.
Complete this audit once and you=E2=80=99ll have a bespoke set of wake-word=
s that map perfectly to your day-to-day muscle memory=E2=80=94no more boile=
rplate copy-paste, no more style drift between meetings.
Next, we=E2=80=99ll cover the guardrails: how to avoid accidental activatio=
n, overlapping rules, and memory bloat so your shiny new bricks don=E2=80=
=99t turn into technical debt.
How does this actually get used?
I=E2=80=99m learning this with you, but here are a few examples that seem p=
retty obvious to me.
Product manager =E2=80=94 SCOPE
I type SCOPE: then dump a fuzzy feature idea. The brick rewrites it into a =
crisp user story=E2=80=94actor, outcome, acceptance tests=E2=80=94ready for=
 Jira. No scavenging old tickets for format; the spell handles the boilerpl=
ate.
Growth marketer =E2=80=94 TUNE
TUNE: this headline returns three variants, each locked to a 45-character l=
imit and framed for curiosity clicks. It even bolds the power verb because =
I told the brick to. A/B copy is now a key-press, not a calendar block.
Staff engineer =E2=80=94 EDGE-SCAN
Paste a function, whisper EDGE-SCAN, get back a bullet list of failure mode=
s the happy-path review missed=E2=80=94null inputs, timeouts, race risks. F=
aster than posting in Slack for drive-by feedback.
Content creator =E2=80=94 QUOTE-HUNT
Feed a 1,000-word draft with QUOTE-HUNT: the brick surfaces two pull-quotes=
 under 100 characters, formatted for Twitter cards. Social snippet creation=
 goes from ten minutes to ten seconds.
Founder-CSO =E2=80=94 RISK-MAP
RISK-MAP plus a new AI feature yields a three-column table=E2=80=94regulato=
ry, security, brand=E2=80=94plus one mitigation per cell. Perfect prep for =
the board call.
I think you can brainstorm some more from here. We=E2=80=99re barely scratc=
hing the surface.
Common Misfires & Guardrails
Even the slickest brick set can derail your workflow if you ignore a few fa=
ilure modes. Here=E2=80=99s the short list of gotchas I=E2=80=99ve seen=E2=
=80=94and the fixes I now bake in.
Remember: bricks are account-scoped. Share the micro-guide text and have th=
em install it themselves.
Guardrail checklist (run before you close a chat):
Search the draft for any wake-word you didn=E2=80=99t mean to fire.
Confirm the brick count =E2=89=A4 5.
Re-run your test prompt; output should be identical to install day.
Keep these rails in place, and your bricks stay a productivity boost=E2=80=
=94not another layer of prompt tech debt.
Next, I=E2=80=99ll show how to package and share bricks with a team so ever=
yone writes in the same voice after a single copy-paste.
Team-Scale Sharing
A single brick can tame your inbox, but shared bricks align an entire org=
=E2=80=99s voice in one afternoon=E2=80=94no plug-ins, no style guides nobo=
dy reads. Think of it as cloning your best prompt muscle memory across the =
team.
Post the micro-guides.
Dump each brick=E2=80=99s text into Slack, Notion, or an internal wiki. Exa=
mple:
Please remember:
Wake-word EXEC-DECK =E2=86=92
Return slide-ready bullets: insight, implication, call-to-action. Max 45 wo=
rds total.
One-time install per teammate.
Everyone opens a fresh ChatGPT chat, pastes the brick, waits for =E2=80=9CG=
ot it!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94done. Five minutes covers the whole department.
Maintain a tiny changelog.
Store version notes right below the brick:
v1.2 =E2=80=93 EXEC-DECK now bolds verbs.
v1.3 =E2=80=93 Raises word cap to 60.
When the log updates, teammates overwrite the brick (never append) and fire=
 the test prompt to confirm parity.
Enforce a brick budget.
Org-wide cap: X active bricks (probably under 10). Too many macros and some=
one will inevitably trigger the wrong one mid-proposal.
Measure the win.
Before rollout: tally average review cycles per deck. After rollout: repeat=
=2E One way to think about it: how many=
 revisions did you cut for that doc? H=
ow quickly are you turning drafts? You get the idea.=20
Why not a plug-in?
Bricks are free, instant, and vendor-agnostic; nobody has to request IT app=
roval or learn a new UI. They also degrade gracefully=E2=80=94forget a bric=
k and you=E2=80=99re back to normal chat, not blocked by a missing extensio=
n.
With a shared brick set, drafts, strategy docs, and investor updates leave =
the building in a single recognizable voice=E2=80=94giving stakeholders one=
 less reason to nit-pick and one more reason to focus on the ideas.
Next we=E2=80=99ll wrap with a concrete challenge: build your first brick t=
onight, share it, and see how many keystrokes you save tomorrow.
Your Five-Minute Challenge
Ready to convert theory into muscle memory? Here=E2=80=99s tonight=E2=80=99=
s mini-sprint:
Audit =E2=80=93 Scroll your last ten chats, spot the instruction you repeat=
ed most.
Draft =E2=80=93 Turn it into a one-sentence brick: Wake-word WRANGLE =E2=86=
=92 =E2=80=9CFlag every unsupported claim and suggest one citation.=E2=80=
=9D
Install =E2=80=93 Paste it into a new chat, add =E2=80=9CPlease remember th=
is,=E2=80=9D wait for Got it!
Test =E2=80=93 Fire the wake-word on a sample prompt; tweak until the outpu=
t is perfect.
Share =E2=80=93 Post the micro-guide on X with #WakeWordBrick and drop the =
link in this Substack=E2=80=99s comments. I=E2=80=99ll riff on the best one=
s in a follow-up.
Tomorrow, see how many times you used that wake word=E2=80=94then decide wh=
ich brick earns the next slot in your personal wall.
Closing Reflection
Keyboard shortcuts shave milliseconds; wake-word bricks reclaim attention, =
the currency that actually limits builders like us. By off-loading our rote=
 style checks to memory, we turn ChatGPT from a reactive chatbot into a rea=
dy workstation: one word, one snap-in instruction, zero mental context swit=
ches. That matters because the big problems=E2=80=94architecting a new data=
 model, mapping a product=E2=80=99s moat, deciding whether to pivot=E2=80=
=94aren=E2=80=99t solved in the slivers between meetings; they need uninter=
rupted cognition.
Bricks won=E2=80=99t replace serious agent frameworks or fully scripted wor=
kflows, but they close a practical gap: the vast middle ground where you st=
ill think for yourself yet refuse to babysit the AI. Install the handful th=
at match your highest-frequency chats and you=E2=80=99ll feel the differenc=
e tomorrow: fewer =E2=80=9Cffs don=E2=80=99t use tables,=E2=80=9D more forw=
ard motion.
Adopt them, refine them, prune them=E2=80=94then get back to work that only=
 a human with context, judgment, and taste can do. If that sounds minor, lo=
ok at your screen-time stats next Friday; those vanished minutes add up to =
the headspace where new ideas bloom.
Thanks for making it this far. Drop what you=E2=80=99re using this for belo=
w. I=E2=80=99m eager to see the bricks you invent=E2=80=94and even more cur=
ious to see what you build with the cognitive slack they buy you.
