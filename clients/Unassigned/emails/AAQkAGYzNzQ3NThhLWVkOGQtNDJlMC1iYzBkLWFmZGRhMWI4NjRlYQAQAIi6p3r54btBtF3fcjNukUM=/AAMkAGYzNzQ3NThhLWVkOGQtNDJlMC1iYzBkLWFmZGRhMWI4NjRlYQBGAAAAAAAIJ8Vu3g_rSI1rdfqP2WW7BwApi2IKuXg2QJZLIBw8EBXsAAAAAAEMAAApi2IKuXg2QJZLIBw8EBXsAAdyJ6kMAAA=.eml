IN THE INDO-PACIFIC, MIDDLE POWERS GAIN GROUND [3]
NO ONE IS WALKING AWAY FROM THE U.S., BUT SOME COUNTRIES ARE EARNING A GREATER SAY IN REGIONAL AFFAIRS.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
By Emmett Stern
The competition between Washington and Beijing has rightly commanded much of the media’s attention lately, but it elides a deeper story playing out in the Indo-Pacific. Several states – most
notably Japan, South Korea and the Philippines – are shaping the regional architecture with more independence than they’ve had in the past. Though they remain embedded in the U.S.-led security
order, these middle powers have dramatically expanded their strategic options, carving out more room to maneuver in a region where trade links collide with territorial disputes, arms buildups and
alliance politics, all without building a formal bloc. This is not a simple balancing act in which weaker states hedge to survive; it is an active effort to shape their environment to their advantage.
Middle powers have more potential influence now than at any time in recent history [4] because the global order is currently without an anchor [5]. In the Indo-Pacific, middle powers share several
traits: They possess enough military and economic capability to influence but not dictate global affairs; they maintain diplomatic networks that bridge rival blocs; and their geography makes them
indispensable to global trade and security corridors.
Thus is the case with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. Their militaries depend in part on U.S. deterrence, but each is also pursuing policies that reflect distinct national priorities rather
than simply mirroring Washington’s. Japan has tailored technology export controls to avoid a blanket U.S. tariff policy. South Korea continues large-scale semiconductor sales to China and has built
an independent arms export business. The Philippines has resumed joint energy exploration talks with Beijing while expanding U.S. base access. These choices show that alliance alignment does not
preclude selective autonomy.
Economic interdependence and security competition in the Indo-Pacific create space for these countries to act. Each depends on trade with China, and each benefits from the U.S.-led security framework,
which still forms the backbone of the regional order. Yet that very dependence on both sides drives them to diversify partners, invest in indigenous capabilities, and use multilateral forums to set
agendas.
Among these three countries, Japan is on top. Tokyo has steadily built capabilities that give it the most independent influence it has had since World War II. It has modernized its military into a
well-equipped, highly trained force with advanced missile defense, anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations capacity. Decades of industrial policy have also produced a technological and
manufacturing base capable of sustaining long-term defense buildup. In recent years, Japan has loosened arms export rules to enable sales to partners such as Poland and the Philippines, invested
heavily in semiconductor production, and expanded infrastructure financing across Southeast Asia and Africa in a way that can occasionally compete with China’s Belt and Road Initiative. An example
of this financing is the Metro Manila Subway, which Japan cofinanced after China halted funding. On technology controls, Japan has also implemented its own advanced chipmaking export restrictions,
though it has stopped short of a full U.S.-style ban to protect its domestic industry. These moves deepen security partnerships, bind regional economies to Japanese supply chains and show a
willingness to adjust alliance policies to fit national interests. Tokyo’s diplomatic maneuverability was also on display when Washington pressed Japan and Australia in mid-July to spell out their
roles in a Taiwan contingency. Both declined to make public commitments, and followed up by signing a $10 billion frigate deal with each other a week later.
South Korea, meanwhile, has become increasingly assertive in both its security and economic policies. While still anchored to its alliance with the U.S., Seoul has expanded defense exports, including
tanks, howitzers and fighter jets, to partners from Europe and the Middle East without U.S. brokerage. This reflects a broader industrial maturation that also includes world-class shipbuilding [6]. It
has joined trilateral security coordination initiatives with the U.S. and Japan – a notable shift given past tensions with the latter – while avoiding full membership in the U.S.-led Chip 4
alliance to preserve trade with China. Economically, South Korea has leveraged its dominance in semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding to secure supply chain partnerships that hedge against
Chinese market risks but do not cut Beijing out entirely. Its 2022 Indo-Pacific strategy outlines a global role that includes cooperation with Washington but prioritizes independent trade and
technology initiatives. Like Japan, South Korea is creating its own financing hub in Southeast Asia, and it hosted its own Pacific Islands forum in 2023 in an effort to counter Chinese influence in
the region.
The Philippines has made the sharpest strategic turn. After years of accommodating Beijing, Manila now openly contests Chinese activities in its exclusive economic zone. It has hosted joint naval
patrols with the U.S., Japan and Australia, and it has expanded allied access under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. At the same time, the Philippines has resumed joint oil and natural gas
exploration talks with China, signaling that it wants to keep some channels open even while deepening security cooperation with Washington. It has also pursued military cooperation with European
partners such as France and Poland. Manila’s push for a reciprocal access agreement with Japan was a result of Philippine diplomacy acting independently of the U.S., denoting a conscious effort to
diversify its security partnerships.
Japan, South Korea and the Philippines illustrate how middle powers in the Indo-Pacific are building complementary strengths. Japan anchors advanced industrial capacity and defense technology, South
Korea reinforces high-end manufacturing and arms production with growing diplomatic reach, and the Philippines strengthens the frontline deterrent in contested waters. None can dictate the regional
order alone, but collectively they complicate any great power’s effort to dominate the Indo-Pacific and help ensure the regional network is not defined solely by outside powers.
Yet structural limits remain. Japan still must manage public concern over full defense normalization and sustain fiscal commitments for its expanded role. South Korea’s global ambitions can be
undercut by the demands of its North Korea posture, which still consumes much of its strategic focus. The Philippines’ approach depends heavily on the political will of its leadership and its
ability to build a credible defense capacity. All three know that Washington’s military presence and alliances remain the foundation of regional security, even as they look for more room to shape
the environment themselves.
Great powers are great powers for a reason, but in today’s Indo-Pacific, the gravitational pull is shifting toward the middle. Japan, South Korea and the Philippines are legitimizing the norms that
keep the system open and building enough capacity to shape the behavior of the United States and China.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The competition be=
tween Washington and Beijing has rightly commanded much of the media=E2=80=
=99s attention lately, but it elides a deeper story playing out in the Indo=
-Pacific. Several states =E2=80=93 most notably Japan, South Korea and the =
Philippines =E2=80=93 are shaping the regional architecture with more indep=
endence than they=E2=80=99ve had in the past. Though they remain embedded i=
n the U.S.-led security order, these middle powers have dramatically expand=
ed their strategic options, carving out more room to maneuver in a region w=
here trade links collide with territorial disputes, arms buildups and allia=
nce politics, all without building a formal bloc. This is not a simple bala=
ncing act in which weaker states hedge to survive; it is an active effort t=
o shape their environment to their advantage.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Middle powers have=
 more potential influence <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailst=

on:none;padding:2px 0px">without an anchor</a>. In the Indo-Pacific, middle=
 powers share several traits: They possess enough military and economic cap=
ability to influence but not dictate global affairs; they maintain diplomat=
ic networks that bridge rival blocs; and their geography makes them indispe=
nsable to global trade and security corridors.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Thus is the case w=
ith Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. Their militaries depend in part=
 on U.S. deterrence, but each is also pursuing policies that reflect distin=
ct national priorities rather than simply mirroring Washington=E2=80=99s. J=
apan has tailored technology export controls to avoid a blanket U.S. tariff=
 policy. South Korea continues large-scale semiconductor sales to China and=
 has built an independent arms export business. The Philippines has resumed=
 joint energy exploration talks with Beijing while expanding U.S. base acce=
ss. These choices show that alliance alignment does not preclude selective =
autonomy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Economic interdepe=
ndence and security competition in the Indo-Pacific create space for these =
countries to act. Each depends on trade with China, and each benefits from =
the U.S.-led security framework, which still forms the backbone of the regi=
onal order. Yet that very dependence on both sides drives them to diversify=
 partners, invest in indigenous capabilities, and use multilateral forums t=
o set agendas.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Among these three =
countries, Japan is on top. Tokyo has steadily built capabilities that give=
 it the most independent influence it has had since World War II. It has mo=
dernized its military into a well-equipped, highly trained force with advan=
ced missile defense, anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations capac=
ity. Decades of industrial policy have also produced a technological and ma=
nufacturing base capable of sustaining long-term defense buildup. In recent=
 years, Japan has loosened arms export rules to enable sales to partners su=
ch as Poland and the Philippines, invested heavily in semiconductor product=
ion, and expanded infrastructure financing across Southeast Asia and Africa=
 in a way that can occasionally compete with China=E2=80=99s Belt and Road =
Initiative. An example of this financing is the Metro Manila Subway, which =
Japan cofinanced after China halted funding. On technology controls, Japan =
has also implemented its own advanced chipmaking export restrictions, thoug=
h it has stopped short of a full U.S.-style ban to protect its domestic ind=
ustry. These moves deepen security partnerships, bind regional economies to=
 Japanese supply chains and show a willingness to adjust alliance policies =
to fit national interests. Tokyo=E2=80=99s diplomatic maneuverability was a=
lso on display when Washington pressed Japan and Australia in mid-July to s=
pell out their roles in a Taiwan contingency. Both declined to make public =
commitments, and followed up by signing a $10 billion frigate deal with eac=
h other a week later.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">South Korea, meanw=
hile, has become increasingly assertive in both its security and economic p=
olicies. While still anchored to its alliance with the U.S., Seoul has expa=
nded defense exports, including tanks, howitzers and fighter jets, to partn=
ers from Europe and the Middle East without U.S. brokerage. This reflects a=
 broader industrial maturation that also includes <a href=3D"https://geopol=
iticalfutures.com/mailster/410768/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6=
Ly9nZW9wb2xpdGljYWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9pcy1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctYXJ=
tcy1tYWtlci8" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">=
world-class shipbuilding</a>. It has joined trilateral security coordinatio=
n initiatives with the U.S. and Japan =E2=80=93 a notable shift given past =
tensions with the latter =E2=80=93 while avoiding full membership in the U.=
S.-led Chip 4 alliance to preserve trade with China. Economically, South Ko=
rea has leveraged its dominance in semiconductors, batteries and shipbuildi=
ng to secure supply chain partnerships that hedge against Chinese market ri=
sks but do not cut Beijing out entirely. Its 2022 Indo-Pacific strategy out=
lines a global role that includes cooperation with Washington but prioritiz=
es independent trade and technology initiatives. Like Japan, South Korea is=
 creating its own financing hub in Southeast Asia, and it hosted its own Pa=
cific Islands forum in 2023 in an effort to counter Chinese influence in th=
e region.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Philippines ha=
s made the sharpest strategic turn. After years of accommodating Beijing, M=
anila now openly contests Chinese activities in its exclusive economic zone=
. It has hosted joint naval patrols with the U.S., Japan and Australia, and=
 it has expanded allied access under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agree=
ment. At the same time, the Philippines has resumed joint oil and natural g=
as exploration talks with China, signaling that it wants to keep some chann=
els open even while deepening security cooperation with Washington. It has =
also pursued military cooperation with European partners such as France and=
 Poland. Manila=E2=80=99s push for a reciprocal access agreement with Japan=
 was a result of Philippine diplomacy acting independently of the U.S., den=
oting a conscious effort to diversify its security partnerships.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Japan, South Korea=
 and the Philippines illustrate how middle powers in the Indo-Pacific are b=
uilding complementary strengths. Japan anchors advanced industrial capacity=
 and defense technology, South Korea reinforces high-end manufacturing and =
arms production with growing diplomatic reach, and the Philippines strength=
ens the frontline deterrent in contested waters. None can dictate the regio=
nal order alone, but collectively they complicate any great power=E2=80=99s=
 effort to dominate the Indo-Pacific and help ensure the regional network i=
s not defined solely by outside powers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Yet structural lim=
its remain. Japan still must manage public concern over full defense normal=
ization and sustain fiscal commitments for its expanded role. South Korea=
=E2=80=99s global ambitions can be undercut by the demands of its North Kor=
ea posture, which still consumes much of its strategic focus. The Philippin=
es=E2=80=99 approach depends heavily on the political will of its leadershi=
p and its ability to build a credible defense capacity. All three know that=
 Washington=E2=80=99s military presence and alliances remain the foundation=
 of regional security, even as they look for more room to shape the environ=
ment themselves.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Great powers are g=
reat powers for a reason, but in today=E2=80=99s Indo-Pacific, the gravitat=
ional pull is shifting toward the middle. Japan, South Korea and the Philip=
pines are legitimizing the norms that keep the system open and building eno=
ugh capacity to shape the behavior of the United States and China.</p>
