THE ASYMMETRY OF MODERN WARFARE: DRONES TAKE CENTER STAGE

 	* BEYOND THE HYPE: We cut through the sensationalism of recent drone
attacks, revealing the terrifying reality of how a $3,000 drone can

vulnerabilities in traditional defenses.
 	* CLOSE-UP COMBAT: Frank explains the concept of "Counter UAS"
(CUAS) and why traditional layered defenses failed against recent
drone strikes, highlighting the gap in close-range counter-drone
technology.
 	* THE "HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP" DILEMMA: We explore the US military's
challenge with chain of command and kill authority, contrasting it
with the autonomous drone operations seen in Ukraine.
 	* EXPONENTIAL GROWTH: The drone market is booming, expanding far
beyond traditional ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) to
becoming direct weapon systems.

KEY COMPANIES & TRADING OPPORTUNITIES: We discuss the drone and
counter-drone companies that are poised to benefit from this evolving
landscape, sharing insights from our Capital Gains service:

 	* AEROVIRONMENT (AVAV): Known for its Switchblade loitering
munitions, AVAV is actively filling significant government orders. We
discuss why waiting for a clear break above its previous high (around
$188-$189) could signal a move towards $230.
 	* RED CAT HOLDINGS (RCAT): This smaller, more affordable quadcopter
drone manufacturer is a favorite among retail traders and social
media, despite its more "hype-driven" revenue. We eye a potential move
towards $8.65 and even $11 if it sustains its breakout.
 	* KRATOS DEFENSE & SECURITY SOLUTIONS (KTOS): A key player in
counter-drone tech, KTOS's drones can emit false signals and mimic
larger aircraft to confuse adversaries. We highlight its strong
performance, trading in the $43 range.
 	* JOBY AVIATION (JOBY) & ARCHER AVIATION (ACHR): These EVTOL
(Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft manufacturers
represent "dual-use technology" =E2=80=93 easily repurposed for military
logistics and personnel transport in contested areas like the South
China Sea. We discuss their bullish charts and long-term potential.
 	* LEONARDO DRS (DRS): A major player in counter-drone technology,
particularly in Europe and Israel, with strong deployed proof of
concept. We note its upward-sloping bullish pitchfork and recommend a
stop-loss around $43.
 	* LOCKHEED MARTIN (LMT) & RAYTHEON (RTX): Traditional defense giants
with strong, upward-sloping pitchforks, indicating continued
bullishness.
 	* NORTHROP GRUMMAN (NOC): Positioned at the bottom of its pitchfork,
NOC is being watched for a potential breakout if it clears overhead
resistance.
 	* BOEING (BA): While not primarily a military drone player, Boeing's
recent commercial orders add to its strength.

THE "DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS" & POLITICAL REALITIES:

 	* We delve into the complexities of government contracts and why
massive announced deals don't always translate into immediate revenue.
 	* The partially CCP-owned Mountain Pass (MP) and its unique position
in the rare earth market.
 	* Insights into the Pentagon's slow, requirements-based acquisition
process versus the need for rapid "needs-based" procurement.
 	* The long-term danger of proliferation: what happens when millions
of small attack drones built for war suddenly become available for
resale post-conflict?

This conversation is a must-watch for anyone looking to understand the
future of warfare, its economic implications, and how to position your
portfolio accordingly.
