What do I do about college? Is school worth it? Is everyone just going to b=
e a vibe coder?
Nate, how can I show what I=E2=80=99m good at in a world where resumes are =
all AI? I have skills and no one will pay attention!
I get these a lot. And it comes down to something really fundamental: we ba=
sed our economy for a long time on knowledge, and knowledge is an inflation=
ary currency.
In fact, knowledge has been hyper-inflating recently.
For us humans, the question is simple: in a world where the currency we=E2=
=80=99ve used to articulate meaning is up for grabs, what do we do?=20
This stuff tends to get whispered about, shouted about (doomer style) and t=
ends to not be discussed very thoughtfully. I want to dig a bit deeper here=
=2E I want to first look at the differe=
ntiation between jobs and skills more=
=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve referenced it but not unpacked it in detail before.
Then I want to respond to two of the biggest elephants in the room directly=
: the question of AGI and the question of college. They=E2=80=99re entangle=
d, but I lay out a response to both, and I think both really rest on this k=
nowledge economy questions, so it makes sense to address them here.
This free post is available to all subscribers, and is an example of the ki=
nd of thing paid subscribers get daily.=20
I=E2=80=99ll be sending my inaugural weekly exec brief to members of the AI=
 Exec Circle this coming Sunday morning. If you=E2=80=99d like to receive i=
t, you can change your plan here [ https://substack.com/redirect/f8d40f11-5=

The Meaning Collapse
There's a radiologist in Cleveland right now staring at an AI system that r=
eads scans better than she does. She's not worried about her job=E2=80=94de=
mand for radiologists is actually increasing. But something darker gnaws at=
 her: if a machine can do in seconds what took her a decade to master, what=
 exactly is she?
This isn't a story about jobs. It's about the collapse of knowledge as the =
fundamental currency of human worth=E2=80=94and the reorganization of meani=
ng that follows. Knowledge is going to keep growing at break-neck pace, but=
 what about us? That=E2=80=99s what we all wonder, and I want to lay out a =
structured way to think about it head-on here.
Knowledge hyperinflation
We're experiencing the first knowledge hyperinflation in human history. Not=
 the gentle devaluation that came with printing presses or calculators, but=
 a complete collapse of the economic and social value of knowing things. Yo=
ur MBA, your decades of experience, your painstakingly acquired expertise=
=E2=80=94they're Weimar Republic Deutschmarks, worthless before the ink dri=
es on your certificate.
This isn't new. Knowledge has been inflating for decades=E2=80=94each gener=
ation needing more education for the same economic position their parents h=
eld. But AI represents the moment inflation tips into hyperinflation. When =
anyone can access all human knowledge instantly and synthesize it perfectly=
, what happens to the social order built on information scarcity? The same =
thing that happens to any currency when supply goes infinite: complete syst=
emic collapse.
Andrew Peterson's research at the University of Poitiers names it "knowledg=
e collapse [ https://substack.com/redirect/83d5666f-90f0-44e8-958a-90889b07=
d3c7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]"=
=E2=80=94when AI systems generate outputs clustered around probability cent=
ers, progressively narrowing the spectrum of available knowledge. His model=
s show that discounting AI content by just 20% causes public beliefs to dri=
ft 2.3 times further from truth. We're not just devaluing knowledge; we're =
homogenizing it.
Jobs aren=E2=80=99t skills=E2=80=A6
Here's where every automation attempt goes wrong, from Roger Smith's GM to =
today's AI evangelists: they decompose jobs into discrete skills, see machi=
nes master those skills, then assume the job itself can be automated. This =
reductionist view misses everything that makes human work valuable.
A lawyer isn't just someone who knows precedents=E2=80=94that's the skill. =
The job involves reading a room, sensing when a client is lying, knowing wh=
en to push and when to yield, building trust over decades. A radiologist do=
esn't just read scans=E2=80=94she translates between machine precision and =
human fear, catches the one-in-a-thousand case that breaks the pattern, pro=
vides the human presence that transforms diagnosis from data to meaning.
The skills can be automated. The job=E2=80=94that complex web of judgment, =
relationships, and context=E2=80=94we have no realistic map for what automa=
tion of that job looks like.
PwC's 2025 data reveals this starkly: industries with highest AI exposure s=
how 3x revenue growth and wages rising twice as fast. Why? Because organiza=
tions that understand jobs as more than skill-bundles use AI to amplify hum=
an capability rather than replace it. Those who see only skills to automate=
 end up like GM=E2=80=94with robots painting each other while market share =
evaporates.
GM finds out the hard way
Roger Smith spent upwards of $90 billion in the 1980s pursuing the ultimate=
 reductionist dream: decompose car manufacturing into discrete tasks, autom=
ate each task, eliminate the workers. The Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant =
opened in 1985 as his monument to this vision.
The reality proved prophetic for our current moment. Spray-painting robots =
coated each other instead of cars. Welding robots sealed doors shut. The "r=
obogate" systems that were supposed to revolutionize assembly instead creat=
ed catastrophic bottlenecks whenever they encountered variations outside th=
eir programming. GM's market share plummeted from 46% to 35.1% during Smith=
's tenure.
The bitter lesson came through NUMMI, GM's joint venture with Toyota. Using=
 GM's worst workforce, Toyota achieved world-class quality not through auto=
mation but through recognizing that manufacturing jobs involved continuous =
improvement, problem-solving, and adaptation=E2=80=94human capabilities tha=
t no amount of discrete skill automation could replicate. GM had automated =
the skills but lost the job.
So what sticks if knowledge doesn=E2=80=99t?
In a world of hyperinflated knowledge, what is hard currency? Let me sugges=
t a non-exhaustive list here. I=E2=80=99ve written about a few of these bef=
ore, but never nailed them down in a single clean list like this. What woul=
d you add?
Glue Work: The invisible labor that connects systems, translates between do=
mains, and maintains coherence. The nurse who bridges between AI diagnosis =
and patient understanding. The project manager who transforms algorithmic o=
utputs into team direction. Undervalued before, essential now.
Taste: In infinite possibility, knowing what to build matters more than kno=
wing how. The creative director choosing from AI's million options. The pro=
duct manager selecting features when anything is technically possible. Tast=
e can't be automated because it's not a skill=E2=80=94it's accumulated judg=
ment about what matters.
Extreme Agency: The ability to operate with minimal direction, maximal owne=
rship. When AI handles execution, humans must excel at goal-setting, priori=
ty-defining, and course-correcting. Agency isn't following instructions=E2=
=80=94it's knowing what instructions to create.
Learning Velocity: Not knowledge accumulation but adaptation speed. The hal=
f-life of technical skills has compressed to 2.5 years. Value accrues to th=
ose who learn faster than knowledge inflates, who surf the wave of obsolesc=
ence rather than drowning in it.
Intent Horizons: The capacity to maintain coherent goals across extended ti=
meframes. AI excels at optimizing immediate objectives but lacks the abilit=
y to balance competing long-term priorities. Humans provide the narrative c=
oherence that prevents optimization from becoming self-defeating.
Interruptibility: The meta-skill of knowing when to stop the machine. Like =
Toyota's jidoka principle=E2=80=94automation with human touch=E2=80=94value=
 concentrates in those who recognize when systems are failing in ways metri=
cs can't capture.
These aren't skills in the traditional sense. They're ways of being that em=
erge from the complex intersection of personality, experience, and judgment=
=2E They resist the decomposition that makes automation possible.
If we don=E2=80=99t know, what are we?
Here=E2=80=99s the thing: The radiologist's crisis isn't economic=E2=80=94i=
t's ontological. For centuries, we built identity on accumulating knowledge=
=2E "I am what I know" was the tacit cr=
eed of the professional class. Degrees=
, certifications, years of experience=E2=80=94these weren't just economic s=
ignals but existential anchors.
Knowledge workers report increasing anxiety about professional relevance, i=
mposter syndrome when AI outperforms their core competencies, and fundament=
al uncertainty about career direction. The psychological impact extends bey=
ond individual identity to social structure. When knowledge no longer confe=
rs status, what organizing principle replaces it?
The answer emerging from successful AI adoptions: we shift from "I am what =
I know" to "I am how I connect, judge, and create meaning from what machine=
s know." This is the world of AI agent managers that Jensen Huang laid out =
in January of this year. The lawyer who saves four hours weekly with AI whi=
le maintaining higher accuracy than either AI or lawyers alone isn't replac=
ed=E2=80=94she's amplified. Her value shifts from information storage to wi=
sdom application.
The paradox of circuit breakers
Financial markets discovered this truth through trillion-dollar near-disast=
ers. Despite algorithms executing 70% of trades, markets depend on human-tr=
iggered circuit breakers to prevent catastrophic losses. When the S&P 500 d=
rops 7%, trading halts for 15 minutes=E2=80=94not for algorithms to recalib=
rate, but for humans to assess whether the selloff reflects reality or algo=
rithmic panic.
March 2020 proved the point: circuit breakers triggered four times in a sin=
gle month, preventing algorithmic feedback loops from destroying market val=
ue. The paradox: as trading becomes more automated, human judgment becomes =
more critical, not less. The humans don't execute trades=E2=80=94they decid=
e when to stop the machines from trading.
Tesla's Full Self-Driving is a really interesting test of this hypothesis. =
Tesla=E2=80=99s essential bet is they=E2=80=99ve seen enough edge cases now=
 to be safe on the road. Safer than humans and safe enough to launch Robota=
xi. Tesla is probably right that they are safer than people (it=E2=80=99s a=
 low bar), but we humans are likely to remain very intolerant of robot erro=
rs in driving=E2=80=94we will absolutely use a double standard here based o=
n patterns of previous investigations. And I have no doubt we will continue=
 to be a majority human driving world for a good long while.
The great miscalculation
Organizations pursuing pure automation make the same error: they see tasks,=
 not systems. They automate skills, not jobs. They replace capabilities, no=
t judgment. The failure rate is predictable and brutal.
IBM Watson Health, sold for $1 billion after $5 billion investment. Google'=
s diabetic retinopathy system, perfect in labs but rejecting 21% of real-wo=
rld images due to lighting variations. Amazon's AI recruiting tool, scrappe=
d after systematically discriminating against women. Each failed by automat=
ing the measurable while failing to measure what mattered.
The successes tell the opposite story. Swedish breast cancer screening comb=
ining AI with radiologists detected 20% more cancers while reducing workloa=
d 44%. Law firms report AI-augmented lawyers generating $100,000 additional=
 billable time annually. Manufacturing technology investment reached $2.81 =
billion in 2024, focused on collaborative robots working alongside humans r=
ather than replacing them.
I=E2=80=99m not here to promise you that organizations won=E2=80=99t make t=
his screw-up again. They will. Nor am I here to make the Pollyanna-ish clai=
m that no jobs will be lost to AI. Nor am I trying to say that automation w=
on=E2=80=99t work.
I=E2=80=99m making a subtler point: by framing jobs in terms of systems of =
skills we are extending 20th century managerial philosophy to the nth degre=
e, and we are going to find out (again) that jobs are more complex than we =
realize. Work that matters is more complex than we realize. And the skill l=
ist I=E2=80=99ve outlined above is a way to start to characterize the world=
 of work beyond the world of knowledge=E2=80=94a description of all the oth=
er stuff we do besides know stuff!
The 56% premium
What=E2=80=99s 56%? This: Workers with AI skills command 56% wage premiums=
=E2=80=94up from 25% a year ago. The real tell? Zuckerberg is now poaching =
AI researchers for $10 million (or more) packages, not just to build better=
 models but to figure out how to help Meta win the AI race. The premium isn=
't for AI expertise itself=E2=80=94it's for knowing how to bridge AI capabi=
lities to real-world value.
The World Economic Forum projects 78 million net new jobs by 2030=E2=80=941=
70 million created, 92 million eliminated=E2=80=94concentrated in roles tha=
t leverage AI as tool rather than replacement. McKinsey (I know lol) finds =
30% of work hours face automation potential, but actual displacement remain=
s far lower as organizations discover the irreplaceable value of human judg=
ment.
The premium doesn't attach to AI skills themselves=E2=80=94those commodify =
quickly and also are somewhat ephemeral as AI systems evolve. It attaches t=
o the meta-skill of knowing how to remain valuable and sticky against probl=
ems as skills commodify. It rewards those who understand that in a world of=
 infinite knowledge, the scarcity shifts outside knowledge toward other hum=
an capacities that can=E2=80=99t be caught by knowing more things.
The choice that defines the next decade
We stand at an inflection point. Not between humans and machines=E2=80=94I =
think that's a false binary. But between two visions of human worth:
Desperately trying to out-know machines, accumulating credentials in a hype=
rinflationary spiral=E2=80=94trying to compete for the knowledge prize with=
 machines
Developing the judgment to know when machines are wrong, rigid, or heading =
toward catastrophe=E2=80=94or more deeply, learning to partner with machine=
s
The first path leads to existential crisis and economic irrelevance. The se=
cond leads to a new form of human value=E2=80=94not despite AI's capabiliti=
es, but because of them.
The radiologist in Cleveland faces something more complex than a skills cri=
sis. ChatGPT scores higher on empathy tests than most doctors. AI reads sca=
ns more accurately. But work isn't individual tasks=E2=80=94it's the bundli=
ng of tasks with ownership, liability, interruptability, long-term thinking=
, and meaning-making within a team and between a team and patients. When th=
e AI misses a tumor, who gets sued? When a patient needs someone to blame, =
who stands there and takes it?=20
And it=E2=80=99s not just negative. Can the AI give the patient a hug? Can =
the AI ask for a second opinion? Can the AI step over and look over a buddy=
=E2=80=99s shoulder? Does the AI tolerate switching to an entirely differen=
t patient history within the same chat?=20
We can go on and on but more fundamentally: if work is the act of making me=
aning, and LLMs are what Karpathy calls "stochastic parrots"=E2=80=94spirit=
s that simulate meaning without creating it=E2=80=94we face unforeseen obst=
acles to getting actual work done. We don=E2=80=99t know what it takes to t=
ruly automate work! The gap between an LLM's summary of War and Peace and a=
ctually reading War and Peace isn't about information transfer. It's about =
experience, transformation, the irreducible difference between knowing abou=
t something and knowing it.
That's not a job description. It's the difference between simulating human =
and being human. And maybe that means that the knowledge isn=E2=80=99t the =
point.
The question isn't whether AI will take your job. It's whether you'll disco=
ver what humans are actually for before your knowledge becomes worthless. T=
he clock is ticking, and the currency of expertise is collapsing faster tha=
n any of us are comfortable with, and it=E2=80=99s demanding that we cultiv=
ate a much wider range of skills than most of our educational systems prepa=
red us for. It=E2=80=99s not easy.
But maybe=E2=80=94just maybe=E2=80=94that's exactly when we discover what b=
eing human was always supposed to mean. I know it=E2=80=99s cheesy but I=E2=
=80=99ve seen people go through this reflection stage individually in journ=
eys over the past few years, and I think it=E2=80=99s a real post-AI human =
realization moment. Call it post-AI midlife crisis if you like.
And right on cue, we have the biggest objection to all this:
Yes, but what about AGI?
"Why prepare for a human-AI hybrid future when AGI will make us all obsolet=
e in a year anyway?"
Here's the honest answer: that=E2=80=99s probably not a correctly framed qu=
estion.=20
Annoying I know. But it matters.
AGI (maybe?) might be achievable with scaled LLM architectures. Intent hori=
zons are doubling every few months=E2=80=94from 3 hours to 7 to potentially=
 30. Memory implementations get more sophisticated daily. In a year or two,=
 these systems might maintain coherent goals for weeks or months. Things wi=
ll get smarter in jagged ways.
But here's what's becoming clear: as LLMs scale brilliantly on the knowledg=
e dimension, we have no clear picture of how they're scaling on the dimensi=
ons that actually matter for getting work done. They're building a ladder t=
o the moon while we need bridges between islands.
The core issue isn't whether they'll achieve long-term memory=E2=80=94they =
probably will. It's whether that memory will have the magical intuitive fle=
xibility that makes human minds special. Current implementations are like l=
ossy JPEGs that sometimes hallucinate what was in the compressed bits: they=
 can retrieve the gist, miss crucial details, and occasionally invent thing=
s that were never there. When you need the exact contract clause or the spe=
cific drug interaction, "mostly right" isn't right.
I=E2=80=99m not clear if the direction we=E2=80=99re going is the correct d=
irection to address some of these fundamental capabilities gaps with humans=
, and what I=E2=80=99ve seen so far doesn=E2=80=99t give me the impression =
we=E2=80=99re making very fast progress on some of the human skills I outli=
ned above. (Most humans breathe in relief here lol)
Another example: LLMs excel at going deep within domains but struggle at th=
e boundaries where real work happens. They can generate brilliant code with=
in a well-defined problem space but miss when the technical challenge has b=
ecome organizational. They can write perfect legal briefs but not recognize=
 when the legal strategy needs to become a business negotiation. This isn't=
 a bug=E2=80=94it's the difference between knowledge and judgment.
Which brings us to what matters: in a world where knowledge can be instantl=
y accessed and credentials can be faked with a ChatGPT account, what consti=
tutes genuine proof of work?
Really excellent software that actually ships and works. You can't fake a c=
odebase that handles real users, real scale, real edge cases. The gap betwe=
en "demo that impresses in an interview" and "system that survives producti=
on" can't be bridged by prompting. It requires the thousand small decisions=
, trade-offs, and intuitions that come from genuine experience.
Writing that changes how people think. Not just grammatically correct prose=
 or well-structured arguments, but writing that creates new mental models, =
that makes readers see the world differently. AI can imitate style but can'=
t generate the lived experience and unique perspective that makes writing r=
esonate at a deep level.
Successful cross-functional projects. Anything requiring navigation across =
technical, business, and human domains. The project manager who ships a fea=
ture by aligning engineering, design, sales, and legal isn't just coordinat=
ing=E2=80=94they're translating between incompatible worldviews, maintainin=
g coherence across context switches that break AI systems.
Building and maintaining trust networks. Reputation that accumulates over y=
ears through consistent judgment calls. The venture capitalist whose portfo=
lio succeeds not through any single brilliant insight but through thousands=
 of micro-decisions about people and possibilities. This can't be speedrun =
or simulated.
Cultural creation and curation. The creative director who consistently iden=
tifies what will resonate before it's obvious. The editor who develops writ=
ers. The A&R person who finds artists before they break. Taste that predict=
s and shapes culture rather than following it.
High-stakes decision-making under uncertainty. The surgeon who recognizes w=
hen to deviate from protocol. The pilot who safely lands a damaged plane. T=
he CEO who navigates a crisis. Situations where judgment must integrate inc=
omplete information, competing priorities, and irreversible consequences.
The pattern? These are all outputs that emerge from the messy intersection =
of knowledge, experience, judgment, and human connection. They're what rema=
ins when pure information processing becomes commoditized.
Anyway, there's something deeper here. If work is fundamentally about makin=
g meaning=E2=80=94not just processing information but creating significance=
=E2=80=94then we face an unexpected obstacle. LLMs are brilliant at simulat=
ing meaning, generating text that feels profound, responses that seem empat=
hetic. They're stochastic spirits that can mimic understanding perfectly. B=
ut mimicry isn't meaning. The difference between an AI's summary of War and=
 Peace and the experience of reading it isn't about information=E2=80=94it'=
s about transformation, about being changed by the encounter.
Work bundles tasks with ownership, liability, and the human act of meaning-=
making. When AI makes a medical error, who owns it? When a project fails, w=
ho takes responsibility? When success happens, who finds meaning in it? The=
se aren't technical problems but existential ones. They can't be solved by =
better algorithms because they're not about processing=E2=80=94they're abou=
t being.
We're watching the greatest shift in human value since the industrial revol=
ution. Not because AI will replace humans, but because it forces us to iden=
tify what was always most valuable about human work: not the knowledge we s=
tore but the connections we make, not the problems we solve but knowing whi=
ch problems matter, not executing tasks but navigating the undefined spaces=
 between them.
The timeline question misses the point. Whether AGI arrives in 2025 or 2050=
, the humans who thrive will be those who understand that in a world of inf=
inite knowledge, value concentrates in judgment, taste, and the ability to =
navigate discontinuity. The clock isn't ticking on human obsolescence=E2=80=
=94it's ticking on our willingness to recognize what makes us irreplaceable=
=2E
Ok and one last question for the road=E2=80=A6
What about college?
On June 24, 2025=E2=80=94just days ago=E2=80=94Monster and CareerBuilder fi=
led for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. These titans of the early internet, who once=
 bought Super Bowl ads to revolutionize job hunting, collapsed under $100-5=
00 million in debt. Their demise isn't just another tech casualty. It's the=
 canary in the coal mine for our entire credentialing system.
Since Oxford's founding=E2=80=94teaching existed there by 1096, though the =
university rapidly developed from 1167=E2=80=94universities have served as =
civilization's knowledge gatekeepers. For nearly a millennium, the path was=
 clear: accumulate knowledge, earn credentials, trade them for economic and=
 social position. This system survived the printing press, the industrial r=
evolution, and the internet. It won't survive AI.
The numbers are staggering, even if contested. Surveys show anywhere from 3=
0% to 89% of college students using ChatGPT for homework, with most estimat=
es hovering around 40% for regular use. Regardless of the exact figure, one=
 educator's observation rings true: this is education's "Lance Armstrong mo=
ment." When enough players cheat with high upside and low consequences, oth=
ers feel forced to cheat to compete. It becomes, in Armstrong's words, "imp=
ossible to win without doping."
But here's the deeper crisis: if knowledge is now free and instant, what ex=
actly are universities selling? Not information=E2=80=94ChatGPT provides th=
at. Not skills=E2=80=94YouTube tutorials teach those. Not even critical thi=
nking=E2=80=94AI can simulate that too. They're selling something increasin=
gly abstract: the idea of credibility in a world where credentials can be f=
aked with a prompt.
The job market reflects this confusion. Nearly half of companies say they p=
lan to eliminate bachelor's degree requirements, yet paradoxically, 59% of =
employers say degrees matter MORE than five years ago. We're watching a sys=
tem in violent transition, unsure whether to double down on traditional cre=
dentials or abandon them entirely.
This isn't just about cheating or job requirements. It's about the collapse=
 of an entire social technology. Degrees served as universal signals=E2=80=
=94imperfect but shared fictions that enabled coordination. An MBA from Wha=
rton meant something specific. Ten years at McKinsey conveyed particular co=
mpetencies. Now these signals are noise. You can fake the knowledge, simula=
te the skills, even mimic the writing style. What can't be faked?
The answer emerging from forward-thinking educators and employers: proof of=
 work that demonstrates judgment, not just knowledge. Ship code that handle=
s real users. Write something that changes how people think. Navigate compl=
ex projects across domains. Build trust networks over years. Create culture=
 rather than consume it. Make high-stakes decisions where failure has real =
consequences. Yes there=E2=80=99s an on-ramp here, but the ideas are there =
to change how we show value and that=E2=80=99s important.
These outputs resist AI assistance not because they're technically difficul=
t but because they require ownership, liability, and the human act of meani=
ng-making. When an AI-written essay fails to persuade, who takes responsibi=
lity? When generated code crashes in production, who fixes it at 3am? When =
a decision goes wrong, who stands before the board?
Universities that survive will transform from knowledge-delivery systems to=
 judgment-development institutions. They'll teach not what to think but how=
 to think when infinite information is available. They'll credential not in=
formation retention but the ability to navigate discontinuity, own outcomes=
, and create meaning from noise.
The students cheating with ChatGPT aren't lazy=E2=80=94they're rational act=
ors in an irrational system (I think Roy and Cluely [ https://substack.com/=

8YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] agree with me on this one thing lm=
ao). They're using 21st-century tools to game 19th-century assessments for =
11th-century credentials. The real scandal isn't that they're cheating. It'=
s that we're still pretending the old game matters.
Monster's bankruptcy filing listed the cause as a "challenging and uncertai=
n macroeconomic environment." But that's corporate speak for a simpler trut=
h: when knowledge becomes worthless, the infrastructure of knowledge-tradin=
g collapses too. First the job boards. Next, perhaps, the universities that=
 feed them.
Unless they remember what they're actually for!
Good luck out there. Stay Curious. Stay human.

 be achievable with scaled LLM architectures. Intent horizons are doubling =
every few months=E2=80=94from 3 hours to 7 to potentially 30. Memory implem=
entations get more sophisticated daily. In a year or two, these systems mig=

jagged ways.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=

e brilliantly on the knowledge dimension, we have no clear picture of how t=
hey're scaling on the dimensions that actually matter for getting work done=
. They're building a ladder to the moon while we need bridges between islan=

memory=E2=80=94they probably will. It's whether that memory will have the m=
agical intuitive flexibility that makes human minds special. Current implem=
entations are like lossy JPEGs that sometimes hallucinate what was in the c=
ompressed bits: they can retrieve the gist, miss crucial details, and occas=

right.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =

t struggle at the boundaries where real work happens. They can generate bri=
lliant code within a well-defined problem space but miss when the technical=
 challenge has become organizational. They can write perfect legal briefs b=

ing deeper here. If work is fundamentally about making meaning=E2=80=94not =
just processing information but creating significance=E2=80=94then we face =
an unexpected obstacle. LLMs are brilliant at simulating meaning, generatin=
g text that feels profound, responses that seem empathetic. They're stochas=
tic spirits that can mimic understanding perfectly. But mimicry isn't meani=
ng. The difference between an AI's summary of War and Peace and the experie=
nce of reading it isn't about information=E2=80=94it's about transformation=
, about being changed by the encounter.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Work bundles tasks =
with ownership, liability, and the human act of meaning-making. When AI mak=
es a medical error, who owns it? When a project fails, who takes responsibi=
lity? When success happens, who finds meaning in it? These aren't technical=
 problems but existential ones. They can't be solved by better algorithms b=
