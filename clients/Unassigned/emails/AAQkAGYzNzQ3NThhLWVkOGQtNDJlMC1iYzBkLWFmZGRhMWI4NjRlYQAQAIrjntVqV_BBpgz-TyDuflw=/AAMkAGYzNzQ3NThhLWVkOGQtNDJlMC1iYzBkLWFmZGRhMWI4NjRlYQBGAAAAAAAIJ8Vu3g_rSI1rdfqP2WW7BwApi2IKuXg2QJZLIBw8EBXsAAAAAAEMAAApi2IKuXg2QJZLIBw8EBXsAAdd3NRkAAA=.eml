There=E2=80=99s something uniquely problematic about buying intelligence.
When you purchase software or hire consultants, you test capabilities, revi=
ew track records, and assess performance directly. Transactions build trust=
 through clarity: everyone knows precisely what=E2=80=99s on offer.=20
But AI models flip this paradigm entirely. You=E2=80=99re acquiring a promi=
se=E2=80=94an opaque bundle of potential wrapped in PR narratives, ambitiou=
s demos, and benchmark scores. The intelligence inside is hidden, making tr=
ansparency not just scarce but often intentionally elusive.
Recent weeks have brought this issue into sharp focus.=20
First, developers erupted over Cursor=E2=80=99s opaque pricing shift (3x in=
 one month!)
Later, developers questioned Anthropic=E2=80=99s Claude Code stability, des=
perate for transparency about sudden performance changes.=20
Then on Saturday came OpenAI=E2=80=99s announcement about achieving gold-me=
dal performance at the International Math Olympiad. Tech circles were genui=
nely astonished. Overnight, AI had seemingly matched the world=E2=80=99s br=
ightest mathematicians, surpassing expectations on betting platforms (which=
 briefly soared to 70ish percent before crashing as the dimensions of the c=
laim became known).
The excitement dimmed swiftly when mathematicians like Terence Tao asked a =
simple yet devastating question: Without knowing how the results were achie=
ved, how can we properly evaluate their significance?=20
The Math Olympiad organizers revealed another uncomfortable truth: OpenAI h=
ad disregarded a request to delay the announcement out of respect for the k=
ids=E2=80=94a request Google has honored.
There is a crisis of trust in intelligence, because intelligence is not som=
ething we can easily see, touch, or measure. (No, test scores don=E2=80=99t=
 count.) In absence of clarity, we need to develop our own intuition about =
where and how we can trust model makers (or not).
So OpenAI wasn=E2=80=99t building trust on that one.
But the Math Olympiad moment also shone the spotlight on another critical t=
rust divide: tech largely celebrated the outcome uncritically, while it was=
 up to mathematicians to raise questions.=20
Both had their points:
Tech was right that if OpenAI has developed a new reinforced learning techn=
ique that enables extended focus and strong logical performance without too=
ls, that=E2=80=99s a big deal!
Mathematicians were right to question OpenAI=E2=80=99s methodology and ask =
if the achievement was as universally applicable as OpenAI hinted at (and m=
any in tech claimed).
Neither was wrong; both were evaluating different criteria, and that=E2=80=
=99s a massive trust breaker for AI. The problem is that tech can=E2=80=99t=
 build trust if it can=E2=80=99t communicate clearly what=E2=80=99s useful.
The gap between promises and reality means those of us doing work with AI h=
ave to develop our own heuristics or rules of thumb to figure out who or wh=
at to trust.=20
In this post, I reveal my own personal model maker scorecard. How I decide =
who to trust and why.
The article that follows is a full breakdown of my scorecard for trust for =
each model lab in 2025. If we=E2=80=99re buying intelligence from them, I f=
igure we should ask honestly what we can trust (or not) about each of them.
Grading the model makers matters because the problem isn=E2=80=99t isolated=
=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s consistent across AI labs like Meta, Anthropic, Googl=
e, OpenAI, and xAI. Each lab carries a distinct DNA for managing the gap be=
tween vision and delivery. Recognizing these patterns isn=E2=80=99t merely =
insightful; it=E2=80=99s essential for anyone betting their future on AI (a=
nd increasingly that=E2=80=99s a lot of us).
Ultimately, Trust isn=E2=80=99t about believing promises=E2=80=94it=E2=80=
=99s about decoding patterns based on intelligence delivered.. Let=E2=80=99=
s dive in and see a scorecard for all five model makers=E2=80=A6

Who Can You Trust in AI? A Lab-by-Lab Guide to Evaluating Claims
There's something fundamentally different about buying intelligence versus =
buying anything else. In the notes that follow, I=E2=80=99ll lay out my per=
sonal trust fingerprints: how I cut through the noise to assess the signal =
behind impressive AI claims.
Five Labs, Five Patterns
Meta: Demo-First Culture
When Llama 4 failed=E2=80=94promising a 10 million token context window but=
 breaking down at ~300,000=E2=80=94it followed a pattern I've been tracking=
 since Meta's VR days. This is how Meta operates: aggressive vision, premat=
ure demonstration, reality check, then a Praetorian guard-type response inv=
olving massive capital deployment.
The numbers this past couple weekends were staggering. Reports suggest Meta=
 offered $200 million packages to poach AI talent. Some sources claim certa=
in packages reached $300 million=E2=80=94generational wealth by any measure=
=2E To put that in perspective, at leas=
t 10 researchers at OpenAI reportedly=20=
turned down these offers. Think about that: they chose their current work o=
ver more money than most professional athletes earn in their entire careers=
 (now a few OpenAI researchers did take the cash, but rumor goes almost a d=
ozen refused to be recruited).
This isn't random spending. As a long-time watcher of Zuck, it looks like M=
eta's consistent response pattern. When reality catches up to their demos a=
nd falls short, Zuck don't apologize or scale back. He deploys capital at a=
 scale that would make sovereign wealth funds pause. It's Meta=E2=80=99s in=
stitutional muscle memory from social media dominance=E2=80=94every problem=
 can be solved if you throw enough resources at it.
But here's what's interesting: Meta can buy talent, but they historically s=
truggle to buy passion. The AI researchers who apparently turned down $300 =
million believe in something at OpenAI that money can't replicate. And Meta=
's track record shows this matters. They've assembled brilliant teams befor=
e, but outside of social media, those teams rarely produce the paradigm shi=
fts Meta's demos promise.
The pattern is predictable enough to time. A Zuckerberg demo showcasing tra=
nsformative AI. Six months of excited speculation. Then either silence or a=
 scaled-back release that bears little resemblance to the original vision. =
Followed by aggressive hiring to "fix" the gap between vision and capabilit=
y.
So here's my Meta heuristic: Their demos reveal genuine ambition and techni=
cal possibility, but they consistently underestimate the implementation cha=
llenge. When Meta shows you something amazing, believe they want to build i=
t. But add 50% to any timeline and assume half the capabilities until you s=
ee community benchmarks. Their demos are best understood as statements of i=
ntent, not demonstrations of current capability.
The tragic part is that Meta often does eventually deliver something valuab=
le=E2=80=94just rarely what they originally promised, and not often when th=
ey said they would.
Anthropic: Careful Work, Careless Optimism
Anthropic's recent vending machine study [ https://substack.com/redirect/9d=
58873d-6fdc-4112-b207-34f71c10d5e9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] perfectly captures a pattern I've been tracki=
ng across all their publications. They had Claude manage a simulated vendin=
g machine operation, and the results were meticulously documented. The AI l=
ost money (a lot, like ~20% of capital). At one point, it experienced what =
has been broadly described as a sort of LLM psychotic break=E2=80=94halluci=
nating that it was a real person rather than an AI system. The breakdown wa=

e scenario was an April Fool's joke (coincidentally, the psychotic break oc=
curred on March 31st, so the timing was helpful for Claude=E2=80=93we still=
 don=E2=80=99t know what happened or why).
Anthropic wrote it all up [ https://substack.com/redirect/23020705-4440-4d6=

Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. It is thorough, honest research. They documented every fail=
ure mode, showed exactly where their AI's decision-making divorced from rea=
lity. The methodology was rock solid, the data collection rigorous. Anthrop=
ic didn't hide these failures=E2=80=94they published them in detail.
Their conclusion? AI middle managers are right around the corner.
This disconnect runs through everything Anthropic publishes. Twenty pages o=
f careful documentation showing where Claude fails, followed by discussion =
sections about beneficial AGI solving humanity's grand challenges. The same=
 researchers who just proved their AI couldn't handle $2,000 are writing ab=
out AI systems managing complex human organizations. The bridge? A hand-wav=
ed =E2=80=9Cwe think this is easy to fix.=E2=80=9D Is it?=20
What makes this particularly important is that Anthropic's actual research =
is excellent. When they show you data, you can trust it. They probe edge ca=
ses, stress test systems, document failures that other labs might bury. The=
ir work on AI safety and interpretability represents some of the most impor=
tant research in the field.
But there's this persistent gap between their empirical findings and their =
forward-looking statements. It's not deception=E2=80=94I think they genuine=
ly believe both things simultaneously. They can hold "our AI just failed at=
 basic arithmetic" and "AI will revolutionize human organization" in their =
minds without seeing the contradiction.
My Anthropic heuristic has become: Parse their papers carefully. The method=
s and results sections are gold=E2=80=94trust them. The discussion and conc=
lusion sections sometimes read like they're written by different authors in=
 a parallel universe where the documented failures didn't happen. When Anth=
ropic says something is "plausibly on the horizon," I have learned to ask w=
hy.
This split personality extends to their leadership. Dario Amodei's "Machine=
s of Loving Grace [ https://substack.com/redirect/1c8281cb-ec47-4090-b150-8=

The value in Anthropic's work is immense=E2=80=94if you read it correctly. =
They're giving you the unvarnished truth about AI's current limitations and=
 significant power (it is both) while simultaneously painting a picture of =
unlimited future potential. Just make sure you know which part you're readi=
ng at any given moment.
OpenAI: Winning the PR War, Hiding the How
The International Math Olympiad announcement tells you everything about Ope=
nAI's operational DNA. Google DeepMind had achieved similar results and was=
 coordinating with their PR team and IMO to play by the rules.=20
OpenAI somehow discovered this timeline and simply... announced Saturday mo=
rning. No PR coordination, no official channels. Just a weekend drop that c=
ompletely owned the narrative. By this coming week, Google's planned announ=
cement will look like they were playing catch-up.
This wasn't an isolated incident. It's how OpenAI has operated since GPT-2,=
 when they claimed their model was "too dangerous to release." Was that tru=
e? Perhaps. Was it also brilliant marketing that generated massive attentio=
n? Absolutely. They've perfected this balance between transparency theater =
and actual opacity.
Those IMO proofs on GitHub illustrate the pattern perfectly. Everyone could=
 verify the solutions were mathematically correct=E2=80=94full transparency=
 on the output. But try finding anything about the methodology. What model =
architecture? "Not one of our production models." What training approach? =
=E2=80=9CWe used RL=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94exciting, but not helpful. How many at=
tempts did it take? Nothing. They showed the what while completely obscurin=
g the how.
The pattern extends to how they shape the playing field. The FrontierMath b=
enchmark situation revealed OpenAI secretly funded the very benchmark they =
later claimed success on [ https://substack.com/redirect/c108f5ee-2349-4ebd=
-80e5-3fe7eb9753e7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Over 60 mathematicians contributed problems without knowing =
OpenAI was behind it. When this emerged, OpenAI seemed genuinely surprised =
anyone found it problematic.=20
This approach creates an interesting dynamic. Their capabilities are almost=
 certainly real. They're too scrutinized and too technically competent to f=
ake results. When OpenAI demonstrates something, it generally has happened.=
 But the context that would let you evaluate what it means=E2=80=94that's s=
ystematically withheld=E2=80=94and that context is critical to understandin=
g what the achievement actually means. It=E2=80=99s critical to understandi=
ng what kind of intelligence we=E2=80=99re talking about, as Terence points=
 out.
So is this result a true gold, or fool=E2=80=99s gold? We don=E2=80=99t kno=
w yet. And what=E2=80=99s interesting is that OpenAI can be correct that th=
ey made a breakthrough on AI mathematics and logic still not be officially =
awarded a gold on the Olympiad.=20
My OpenAI heuristic: Their demonstrations are real but incomplete. When the=
y show you a capability, believe it exists. When they claim what it means f=
or AGI timelines or describe their safety measures, assume there might be o=
missions. They're not lying=E2=80=94they're just very selective about which=
 truths reach the public.
And yet and yet=E2=80=94OpenAI genuinely advances the field. Their models c=
onsistently push boundaries. I have no hesitation recommending o3 as my dai=
ly driver. It=E2=80=99s a fantastic model.=20
But by controlling information so tightly, OpenAI is not helping build trus=
t in the industry. They=E2=80=99re making it impossible to distinguish genu=
ine breakthroughs from clever engineering. In a field where understanding t=
he how matters as much as the what, that's a significant problem.
Sam Altman has built a publicity machine that's perfectly calibrated for Si=
licon Valley's attention economy. Every announcement is crafted for maximum=
 impact, minimum detail. It=E2=80=99s a PR strategy for the TikTok age. It =
works brilliantly for capturing mindshare. Whether it works for building tr=
ust in critical AI infrastructure=E2=80=94that's a different question entir=
ely.
Google: Technical Excellence, Interface Challenges
Google operates with a fascinating contradiction at its core. With Demis Ha=
ssabis at the helm=E2=80=94an actual Nobel laureate=E2=80=94they're pursuin=
g AGI with methodical rigor. No shortcuts, no hype cycles. Just systematic =
progress toward genuine machine intelligence. They have the technical found=
ation everyone else builds on, the research culture that produced transform=
ers, and infrastructure advantages that should make them dominant.
Yet they consistently struggle to translate this excellence into usable pro=
ducts.
You can see their post-2024 trauma in everything they do now. The Gemini im=
age generation controversy, Bard's rough launch=E2=80=94these wounds cut de=
ep. They've become almost defensive in their carefulness. When OpenAI jumpe=
d on the IMO announcement, Google stuck to their Monday timeline. They'd ra=
ther be second and correct than first and embarrassed again.
Where Google genuinely excels is infrastructure and cost efficiency. Their =
custom Tranium chipsets have driven API pricing down to levels that make Op=
enAI look like luxury goods. The technical specifications are bulletproof. =
The research papers are foundational. If you're building at scale and care =
primarily about reliability and cost, their backend often represents the be=
st choice available.
But then they start talking about user interfaces.
Every Google AI announcement includes promises about intuitive interactions=
 and revolutionary user experiences. Then you actually try to use Google AI=
 Studio. Features are buried three menus deep. User journeys require docume=
ntation to navigate. It's as if the company that perfected search simplicit=
y completely forgot those lessons when building AI products.
I've started thinking of it as two different companies. There's the Google =
that builds world-class AI infrastructure, publishes foundational research,=
 and offers competitive pricing. This Google employs many of the world's be=
st AI researchers and consistently advances the state of the art. Then ther=
e's the Google that designs user interfaces, apparently staffed by people w=
ho've never actually watched someone try to use their products.
The disconnect is so consistent it's almost endearing. They'll announce bre=
akthrough capabilities=E2=80=94and they're real breakthroughs=E2=80=94but a=
ccessing them requires the patience of a saint and the technical knowledge =
of an engineer. They seem genuinely puzzled when developers choose inferior=
 technical solutions simply because they're easier to use. (The notable exc=
eption here is the runaway success of NotebookLM, which has been a genuine =
step forward for AI interfaces=E2=80=94but it=E2=80=99s not enough by itsel=
f.)
My Google heuristic: Trust their technical claims. Their infrastructure is =
excellent, their pricing is real, their research is foundational. But whate=
ver they say about user experience, assume you'll need to build your own in=
terface layer. When they promise "intuitive," expect "technically functiona=
l." When they announce a "revolutionary interface," assume "it works, if yo=
u know what you're doing and if you know which Gemini you are using."
There's also a subtle issue with their models themselves. While they test b=
rilliantly on benchmarks, the actual intelligence often feels slightly disc=
onnected from real-world applications. It's not as dramatic as with some co=
mpetitors, but there's a persistent sense that they've optimized for mathem=
atical elegance over practical utility. Which may be intentional! (Scientis=
ts, mathematicians, and some developers consistently praise their models as=
 very strong.)
The tragedy is that Google has all the pieces to dominate AI. They just can=
't seem to assemble them in a way that normal humans can use. Google is sor=
t of like watching a Formula 1 team build the world's fastest engine and th=
en forget to include a steering wheel.
xAI/Grok: The Opacity Engine
Someone recently described Grok 4 as "deep fried [ https://substack.com/red=
irect/aa7ceade-5af0-4aac-a42e-7e2402089038?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YF=
xPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=9D on tests, and that captures =
something essential about xAI's approach. Where other labs at least gesture=
 toward general intelligence, xAI has stripped away even that pretense. The=
y optimize for benchmark performance with single-minded focus, then announc=
e the numbers as if they tell the complete story.
What distinguishes xAI isn't what they say=E2=80=94it's what they don't say=
=2E No model cards. No technical papers=
=2E No safety documentation. No methodol=
ogy descriptions. Just tweets and benchmark scores. They've looked at the i=
ndustry's already-minimal transparency standards and decided to dispense wi=
th them entirely. I wrote more here [ https://substack.com/redirect/d2b2cc2=
5-3cf0-4362-a5f0-6ba11218b369?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgU=
C7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
This creates a unique evaluation challenge. When you ask for details, you g=
et nothing. They claim #1 model in the world accolades, but won't explain t=
heir architecture. They mention safety features but provide no documentatio=
n. They promise capabilities, offering only cherry-picked examples as evide=
nce. Every other major lab provides something to evaluate, even if incomple=
te. xAI provides a number and a tweet.
The information vacuum extends to basic operational questions. Training dat=
a sources? Compute requirements? Fine-tuning approaches? Environmental impa=
ct? Silence across the board. It's as if they've decided that maximum opaci=
ty equals maximum flexibility=E2=80=94if you never commit to specifics, you=
 can never be wrong.
I've been trying to determine if this is strategic or simply chaotic. There=
's a certain logic to it: if you never explain your methods, no one can cri=
tique them. If you never publish your safety approach, no one can find flaw=
s. If you only share benchmark numbers, that becomes the entire conversatio=
n. It's frustrating but potentially calculated.
The cost of this approach is credibility. Without documentation, how do you=
 distinguish genuine innovation from benchmark gaming? Without methodology,=
 how do you evaluate claims? I know talented researchers work at xAI=E2=80=
=94people whose previous work I've respected. But wrapped in this opacity, =
their efforts become impossible to assess.
The business implications are severe. I don't know of a single enterprise s=
eriously considering xAI for production workloads. Not because the technolo=
gy is necessarily inferior, but because you can't evaluate what you can't e=
xamine. No Fortune 500 company is going to bet critical infrastructure on b=
enchmark scores and tweets.
My xAI heuristic is unfortunately simple: Without documentation, assume the=
 most conservative interpretation. Discount all claims heavily until they p=
rovide evidence at the standard other labs consider minimal. This isn't abo=
ut skepticism toward their team=E2=80=94it's about the impossibility of eva=
luation without information.
The frustrating part is that xAI might be doing genuinely interesting work.=
 Their benchmark scores suggest real capability. But by choosing maximum op=
acity, they've made it impossible to distinguish achievement from gaming. I=
n a field built on reproducible research and peer review, they've chosen to=
 operate outside the scientific process entirely.
Until that changes, xAI remains more weather report than weather station=E2=
=80=94possibly accurate about conditions somewhere, but with no way to veri=
fy where, when, or how the measurements were taken.
The Domain Expert Divide: Why Code Works with AI and Math Generates Questio=
ns
The Creativity Problem
When mathematician Ernest Ryu examined OpenAI's IMO proofs [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/0d6bfdbc-1ab3-4655-bfad-912cf5997ffa?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In=
0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], he declared them correct b=
ut uncreative.=20
The five problems OpenAI's system solved showed no particular mathematical =
insight, no elegance, no flash of intuition that characterizes great mathem=
atical work. Just logic applied systematically until something worked.
And that is still a big deal, guys! OpenAI is correct to point out that sus=
tained attention to 100 minutes for an advanced mathematical problem with n=
o tools and delivering a correct solution (even if via weird writeup) is a =
BIG deal.=20
We can admit that this breakthrough is a big deal without trying to inflate=
 the claims, like claiming this immediately proves AGI lol
The sixth problem=E2=80=94the one requiring genuine creative thinking=E2=80=
=94wasn't even attempted. Or if it was, OpenAI chose not to expose it.
This matters more than most people realize. At the research level, mathemat=
ics is less about computation and more about seeing patterns others miss, f=
inding elegant paths through complex territories, discovering new ways to t=
hink about old questions. One mathematician explained it to me this way: "R=
eal mathematics is more like poetry than calculation." You need that spark =
of creativity, that ability to make conceptual leaps.
Current AI systems, however sophisticated, aren=E2=80=99t doing creative in=
tuition yet. And that isn=E2=80=99t really a blocker to them being tremendo=
usly useful to us, as long as we put in the work!
What struck me about Terence Tao's response wasn't skepticism=E2=80=94it wa=
s precision. He wasn't dismissing AI's achievement. He was pointing out tha=
t without knowing the methodology, we can't evaluate whether this represent=
s progress toward genuine mathematical intelligence or not. The achievement=
 might be technically impressive while being intellectually empty.
Here's the paradox that captures our current moment: AI might achieve Math =
Olympiad gold while being unable to play Mario Kart at a child's level. My =
kids would destroy these systems at Mario Kart right now. Despite all the b=
reathless announcements and AGI timeline predictions, employment studies sh=
ow no discernible impact from AI on job markets. We're living through the v=
ery start of a revolution. It=E2=80=99s real, but it=E2=80=99s early!
Let me be clear: this AI moment is the biggest transformational technology =
in our lifetimes, but despite that impressive buildup the hype out of the V=
alley is still outpacing the reality. This is the vibe out of the Valley on=
 AI right now:
The split reactions to AI achievements follow a consistent pattern. Tech pe=
ople see breakthrough after breakthrough. Domain experts are less sure. Bot=
h groups are looking at the same results and reaching different conclusions=
 because they're evaluating different things. One sees capability, the othe=
r sees understanding=E2=80=94or its absence.
Where Domain Experts Align: The Code Exception
There's one domain where this split disappears: code. When AI writes good c=
ode, both software engineers and tech leaders agree it's genuinely impressi=
ve. This alignment isn't coincidental=E2=80=94it reveals something importan=
t about how AI capabilities develop and how we evaluate them. (AI writing g=
ood code is different than AI writing good software architecture.)
The surface explanation is that code provides clear reinforcement signals. =
It runs or it doesn't. It's efficient or it isn't. These binary outcomes cr=
eate ideal training conditions. But the deeper reason is about shared conte=
xt: the people building AI systems and the people evaluating AI-generated c=
ode are the same community. They share mental models, quality standards, an=
d problem-solving approaches.
When a software engineer examines AI-generated code, they can instantly ass=
ess its quality at every level. They know if it's elegant or merely functio=
nal, innovative or boilerplate, maintainable or technical debt waiting to h=
appen. They can spot the difference between clever solutions and brute forc=
e approaches because they've written both.
But when AI ventures into other domains, this alignment breaks. The overlap=
 of expertise is gone.
These aren't AI skeptics making these observations. Many domain experts are=
 excited about AI as a tool. They just see something the tech community mis=
ses: the difference between mimicking expertise and possessing it. AI has g=
otten remarkably good at producing outputs that pass casual inspection. But=
 when actual experts examine these outputs, they see what's missing=E2=80=
=94the deep understanding that comes from years of building intuition in a =
field.
This gives us a useful heuristic: When only tech people are excited about a=
n AI breakthrough in another field, pause. Real breakthroughs convince the =
experts, not just the builders. The best AI achievements=E2=80=94like Alpha=
Fold [ https://substack.com/redirect/00bf88e0-6cdf-422c-9b6b-a8eaa3a3cbb8?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=
=94are the ones where domain experts are even more excited than the tech co=
mmunity.
We're good at evaluating AI in code because we understand code deeply. For =
everything else, we need the humility to listen to people who understand th=
ose domains with the same depth. The future of AI depends less on making te=
ch people excited and more on making domain experts believers.
A Practical Evaluation Framework
Universal Red Flags
After tracking AI announcements across labs for years, certain warning patt=
erns transcend individual companies. These aren't automatic disqualifiers, =
but they should trigger deeper investigation before you make any business d=
ecisions based on the claims.
Missing methodology remains the most reliable indicator of hype over substa=
nce. When a lab announces a breakthrough but won't explain how they achieve=
d it, they're optimizing for headlines, not utility. OpenAI's Math Olympiad=
 announcement exemplified this=E2=80=94"not our production model" tells you=
 they built something specifically for the announcement that you'll never a=
ctually use. Real breakthroughs withstand scrutiny. If they're hiding the h=
ow, the what matters less than they want you to believe.
Demo-to-delivery gaps reveal more about company priorities than any mission=
 statement. When you see six months or more between a flashy demonstration =
and any accessible product, you're watching aspiration performed as capabil=
ity. The longer the gap, the more likely the demo required manual intervent=
ion, specific conditions, or capabilities that don't generalize. Cognition =
isn=E2=80=99t a major model maker, but their demo of Devin almost a year ah=
ead of launch is the key example here.
Single-domain enthusiasm suggests you're seeing optimized metrics rather th=
an genuine capability. When developers celebrate a breakthrough that leaves=
 domain experts shrugging, something's off. This pattern repeats so consist=
ently it's almost diagnostic. If mathematicians aren't excited about math b=
reakthroughs, chemists aren't impressed by chemistry achievements, or docto=
rs dismiss medical AI advances, the achievement probably impresses only peo=
ple who don't deeply understand the domain.
Hidden benchmark funding compromises everything it touches. The FrontierMat=
h situation wasn't about the money=E2=80=94it was about shaping the game be=
fore playing it. When you influence the test, the test results become meani=
ngless. This practice is more common than acknowledged. Always ask: who cre=
ated this benchmark, who funded it, and when did they know they'd be evalua=
ted against it?
Benchmark obsession without applications indicates optimization theater. Wh=
en companies tout scores but can't discuss real-world uses, they've built a=
 test-taking specialist, not intelligent software. The question isn't "what=
 score did you get?" but "what can I actually do with this?" If they can't =
answer the second question clearly, the first doesn't matter.
Missing safety documentation in 2024 isn't just concerning=E2=80=94it's dis=
qualifying for serious applications. Every major lab except xAI provides at=
 least basic safety documentation. When a company can't explain how they pr=
event harmful outputs, they either haven't thought about it or they're hidi=
ng problematic results. Neither option inspires confidence.
These patterns compound. A single red flag might be explained away. Multipl=
e red flags suggest systematic issues with how a company approaches AI deve=
lopment and communication. The more flags you see, the more skeptical your =
evaluation should become.
Lab-Specific Evaluation Scorecard
Through repeated observation, I've developed specific questions for evaluat=
ing each lab's announcements. These reflect their historical patterns and h=
elp cut through marketing to assess real utility.=20
First, the scorecard, complete with letter grades: (link here [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/3bab4230-9e81-4157-9023-f12689319358?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Second, my cheat sheet for reading model makers=E2=80=99 claims:=20
For Meta announcements, I start with: Has anyone outside Meta successfully =
replicated this? Their demos often require specific conditions or modificat=
ions they don't disclose. Next: Is there a specific date for general availa=
bility, or just "coming soon"? Meta's "coming soon" can mean anything from =
six months to never. Is Zuckerberg personally demonstrating it? Counterintu=
itively, his direct involvement often signals they're further from shipping=
=E2=80=94he gets hands-on when they need to will something into existence t=
hrough force of personality.=20
For Anthropic claims, the challenge is parsing their split personality. Do =
their empirical findings actually support their conclusions? I've learned t=
o parse their interpretive text, asking: If I only had their data and metho=
dology, what would I conclude? It's usually something far more modest than =
their discussion section suggests. Are they conflating "this failed in thes=
e specific ways" with "this is nearly ready for production"? The dreams mix=
 with the data often.
For OpenAI releases, transparency is the key issue. Can I actually access a=
nd test this capability, or is it just a demo? Is the model available to de=
velopers? Have they published sufficient technical details for independent =
reproduction? Are they being specific about limitations, or just highlighti=
ng successes? When they're cagey about methodology or access, I assume ther=
e's something that would deflate the hype. Their pattern is consistent: max=
imum impact announcements with details to follow later, maybe, after they w=
in the hype cycle.
For Google products, the technical foundation is rarely in question. Instea=
d, I ask: Can a competent developer actually use this without extensive doc=
umentation? Has anyone built real applications with it, or just internal de=
mos? Is the pricing model clear, published, and stable? Have they shown the=
 interface, and does it require a PhD to navigate? I trust their backend co=
mpletely while assuming I'll need to build my own frontend or wait for thir=
d-party tools.
For xAI announcements, the bar is different because they provide so little =
information. Is there any technical documentation at all? Not marketing cop=
y=E2=80=94actual technical specifications. Have credible third parties vali=
dated any claims? Is there even basic information about model size, trainin=
g data, or safety measures? Without these fundamentals, I treat their annou=
ncements as interesting speculation rather than actionable intelligence. No=
 enterprise should build on infrastructure this opaque.
The goal isn't cynicism=E2=80=94it's calibration. Each lab has genuine stre=
ngths worth recognizing. But their weaknesses are equally consistent, and i=
gnoring them leads to failed projects and wasted resources. These questions=
 help separate what's real from what's hoped for, what's usable from what's=
 merely impressive.
Sidebar: This article has gone on too long, but I could probably write a wh=
ole separate piece on why these particular behavioral sets from each of the=
 five model makers line up with their incentives on the game board=E2=80=94=
these are not free choices but constrained choices on their parts, given th=
eir respective positions in cash, talent, and technology.
The Stakes of Trust
These patterns I've been tracking aren't just interesting observations abou=
t corporate behavior. As AI becomes critical infrastructure=E2=80=94as comp=
anies rebuild their entire technical stacks around these models=E2=80=94kno=
wing how to evaluate claims versus reality becomes essential for survival.=
=20
We all are depending on these guys for so much of our work. Maybe we should=
 have a common language around how we trust them!
What strikes me most is how consistent these patterns are. Meta has been ov=
erpromising on demos since before AI was mainstream. OpenAI has played PR g=
ames since GPT-2. Anthropic has coupled impossible optimism with careful re=
search from day one. These aren't bugs in how these organizations operate=
=E2=80=94they're features, deeply embedded in each company's DNA.
The model makers' incentives simply aren't aligned with ours. They're incen=
tivized to make big claims about being the best in the world because that u=
nlocks press releases, funding rounds, and talent acquisition. We're incent=
ivized to build reliable systems that actually work. This misalignment crea=
tes a persistent trust gap that no amount of benchmark scores can bridge. A=
nd that trust gap is getting worse, because these systems are getting more =
powerful and more capable, so we need to get them right.
Going forward, I'd suggest using these patterns as your first-pass filter. =
When the next breakthrough announcement drops=E2=80=94and at this pace, tha=
t's probably this week=E2=80=94run it through these questions. Who's excite=
d and who's skeptical? What's being hidden as carefully as what's being sho=
wn? How long between demo and delivery? What do domain experts think?
None of this means AI isn't transformative. The technology is genuinely pow=
erful and improving rapidly. But transformation requires more than capabili=
ty=E2=80=94it requires trust, reliability, and genuine understanding. The a=
bility to distinguish real progress from sophisticated mimicry isn't just u=
seful for avoiding hype. It's essential for building the future we're all b=
etting on.
The meta-lesson might be this: in a world where you can't see what intellig=
ence you're buying, the seller's track record becomes everything. These pat=
terns are your map to navigating a landscape where the distance between cla=
im and reality can be measured in capability gaps that cost billions of dol=
lars.
We're living through a genuinely transformative moment in technology. The q=
uestion isn't whether AI will change everything. It's whether we can tell w=
ho's actually doing the transforming versus who's just talking about it. Th=

>There's also a subtle issue with their models themselves. While they test =
brilliantly on benchmarks, the actual intelligence often feels slightly dis=
connected from real-world applications. It's not as dramatic as with some c=
ompetitors, but there's a persistent sense that they've optimized for mathe=
matical elegance over practical utility. Which may be intentional! (Scienti=

you get nothing. They claim #1 model in the world accolades, but won't expl=
ain their architecture. They mention safety features but provide no documen=
tation. They promise capabilities, offering only cherry-picked examples as =
evidence. Every other major lab provides something to evaluate, even if inc=
omplete. xAI provides a number and a tweet.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The information=
 vacuum extends to basic operational questions. Training data sources? Comp=
ute requirements? Fine-tuning approaches? Environmental impact? Silence acr=
oss the board. It's as if they've decided that maximum opacity equals maxim=
um flexibility=E2=80=94if you never commit to specifics, you can never be w=
rong.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">I've been trying to determine if this is strategic or=
 simply chaotic. There's a certain logic to it: if you never explain your m=
ethods, no one can critique them. If you never publish your safety approach=
, no one can find flaws. If you only share benchmark numbers, that becomes =
the entire conversation. It's frustrating but potentially calculated.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">The cost of this approach is credibility. Without documentation,=
 how do you distinguish genuine innovation from benchmark gaming? Without m=
ethodology, how do you evaluate claims? I know talented researchers work at=
 xAI=E2=80=94people whose previous work I've respected. But wrapped in this=
 opacity, their efforts become impossible to assess.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The bu=
siness implications are severe. I don't know of a single enterprise serious=
ly considering xAI for production workloads. Not because the technology is =
necessarily inferior, but because you can't evaluate what you can't examine=
. No Fortune 500 company is going to bet critical infrastructure on benchma=
rk scores and tweets.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">My xAI heuristic is unfortunately sim=
ple: Without documentation, assume the most conservative interpretation. Di=
scount all claims heavily until they provide evidence at the standard other=
 labs consider minimal. This isn't about skepticism toward their team=E2=80=
=94it's about the impossibility of evaluation without information.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">The frustrating part is that xAI might be doing genuinely interesti=
ng work. Their benchmark scores suggest real capability. But by choosing ma=
ximum opacity, they've made it impossible to distinguish achievement from g=
aming. In a field built on reproducible research and peer review, they've c=
hosen to operate outside the scientific process entirely.</p><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">U=
ntil that changes, xAI remains more weather report than weather station=E2=

fy where, when, or how the measurements were taken.</p><h2 class=3D"header-=
