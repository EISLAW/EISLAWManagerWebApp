-im-not-technical-enough-for

Yesterday, I got a message that I thought was so important I wanted to shar=
e it with all of you.
It came from someone who goes by NexGen Caveman online. He gave me permissi=
on to share this:
Hey NATE,
My name's [NexGen Caveman]. I'm a 37 yo blue-collar guy, a new dad, and I'm=
 trying to wrap my head around this whole AI and tech world. The thing is, =
most of the content out there is super technical and way over my head. By t=
he time people start throwing around all the jargon, I'm already lost.
I know this stuff is important for the future =E2=80=94 for my family and t=
he things I'm trying to build =E2=80=94 but it feels like there's this huge=
 disconnect between how it's explained and how guys like me actually unders=
tand it. I've been following your work and really respect how you break thi=
ngs down.
If you have any advice on how I can cut through the noise and focus on what=
 actually matters, I'd be grateful. And if there's anything you need from m=
e on my end to make that easier, just say the word.
Thanks for what you're doing =E2=80=94 it's helping guys like me even if we=
 don't always say it. =E2=80=93 [NexGen Caveman]
PS I USED AI TO WRITE THIS MESSAGE BUT I ALSO PUT MY OWN TWIST ON IT =F0=9F=
=98=9C=F0=9F=98=81
That postscript got me. Here's someone who feels locked out of the AI conve=
rsation, yet he's already using it to communicate more effectively. He's li=
ving proof that the biggest barrier to AI isn't technical knowledge=E2=80=
=94it's the way we talk about it.
The Uncomfortable Truth About My Technical Content
I've been writing about AI for a while now. I dive deep into model architec=
tures, explore automation workflows, dissect the latest papers. There's rea=
l value in that technical depth=E2=80=94serious competitive advantages for =
people who go deep.
But NexGen Caveman's message gives me a chance to say something I=E2=80=99v=
e been looking to say for awhile: technical content needs to be a lever not=
 a barrier.
Because while I'm writing about retrieval-augmented generation and using Cl=
aude Code well, there are millions of people who just need to know that AI =
can help them write a professional email after a 12-hour shift when their b=
rain is fried.
I don't want my technical stories to make anyone think AI isn't for them if=
 they're not technical. That would be the biggest mistake they could make r=
ight now. Because while the advanced stuff is incredible, the simple applic=
ations of AI are often the most powerful and life-changing for folks gettin=
g started with AI.
The Great AI Disconnect
Here's what kills me: Most AI content reads like it was written by people w=
ho've never had to explain a billing issue to an angry customer at 6 PM on =
a Friday. Or draft a quote while sitting in their truck between jobs. Or wr=
ite a parent email after teaching 30 seven-year-olds all day.
It=E2=80=99s personal to me, because I=E2=80=99ve had a succession of non-t=
ech and non-AI jobs before I got into my current career path. I=E2=80=99ve =
been a box folder in a Windex factory. I=E2=80=99ve been an arborist. I=E2=
=80=99ve worked the floor at REI as a retail associate. I=E2=80=99ve worked=
 as a grant writer. I=E2=80=99ve burned my hands using a welder trying to m=
ake steel parts.
And I can look back now and see dozens of ways AI would have helped former =
Nate! As long as I had accessible training. And that=E2=80=99s the key.
The research backs this up. When you ask workers why they don't use AI, 48%=
 say inadequate training is their biggest barrier. But they don't mean trai=
ning on neural networks and token architectures. They mean nobody's shown t=
hem how AI helps with their specific problems. Nobody's speaking their lang=
uage.
52% of workers say they receive only basic training on new tools, and 1 in =
5 get little to no instruction at all. Meanwhile, 78% of organizations repo=
rt using AI in 2024, up from 55% the year before=E2=80=94but most workers s=
till feel left out.
It=E2=80=99s important to be real clear about AI as a problem solver, and n=
ot set up AI as a glorious technical achievement that feels off-putting.
This is especially important becase studies show AI helps the least experie=
nced workers the most. If you struggle with writing, AI makes you sound pro=
fessional. If English isn't your first language, AI helps you communicate c=
learly. The people who need it most in many cases feel like it=E2=80=99s im=
possible to get the training they need to make AI useful at work and at hom=
e.
That=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m writing this letter.
AI Isn't Complicated=E2=80=94We Just Make It Sound That Way
Here's the simplest way I can put it: AI is just really good at handling wo=
rds.
That's it. That's the breakthrough.
You don't need to understand transformers or attention heads any more than =
you need to understand internal combustion to drive to work. The only quest=
ion that matters is: "Am I dealing with something that involves words, and =
is it eating up my time?"
If yes, AI can probably help. If no, use your regular tools.
I've seen that click moment when I explain it this way in real life. The HV=
AC tech who starts using AI to explain complex problems to customers withou=
t sounding condescending. The restaurant manager who uses it to write sched=
ules that don't create drama. The contractor who uses it to turn bid requir=
ements into clear project timelines.
These aren't people becoming "AI experts." They're people who recognized th=
ey had a word problem and found a word solution.
Three Ways AI Actually Helps (No Computer Science Degree Required)
1. It Gives You Back Your Evenings
Every job has that stuff that isn't really your job but somehow becomes you=
r job. The emails. The reports. The explanations. The follow-ups. People us=
ing basic AI tools report saving 3.5 to 5 hours per week. That's not optimi=
zation=E2=80=94that's getting your life back.
A teacher I know uses AI to turn her messy class notes into parent newslett=
ers. Used to take her an hour every Friday. Now it takes five minutes. She =
doesn't use AI to teach=E2=80=94she uses it to handle the administrative bu=
rden that was crushing her.
Real productivity data shows AI delivering 13-66% efficiency gains, with th=
e biggest improvements going to people who struggled most with communicatio=
n tasks. Construction companies using AI report 20-30% productivity lifts w=
ithin 3-6 months.
2. It Makes Everyone Sound Professional
Some people are natural writers. Most aren't. But in today's world, how you=
 communicate in writing affects how people perceive your competence. That's=
 unfair, but it's real.
AI levels this playing field. That email to the difficult client? AI helps =
you sound firm but professional. That project update? AI helps you organize=
 scattered thoughts into clear points. That delicate conversation with an e=
mployee? AI helps you find the right words when you're emotional.
Studies show AI adoption has surged among white-collar workers=E2=80=9427% =
now use it frequently at work, up 12 percentage points in just one year. Bu=
t the biggest opportunity is still with people who aren't naturally comfort=
able with written communication.
3. It Stops You From Leaving Money on the Table
How many opportunities die because you didn't follow up properly? How many =
relationships sour because you communicated poorly under stress? How many d=
eals fall through because you couldn't quickly research what a client asked=
 about?
Sales teams using AI close 15% more deals. Customer service teams handle 15=
% more issues per hour. Not because AI is doing the work, but because it's =
handling the communication overhead that was slowing them down.
Blue-collar industries are seeing particularly strong results=E2=80=94compa=
nies using AI platforms for field work report 20-30% productivity gains as =
workers spend less time on diagnostics and more time solving actual problem=
s.
How to Know You Have an AI Problem
Ask yourself: "Am I doing something with words that either takes forever, I=
 do constantly, or I mess up when I'm stressed?"
That's an AI problem.
Specific AI problems:
Writing emails that need to sound professional but not robotic
Explaining complex stuff to customers in simple terms
Following up without sounding desperate or annoying
Organizing information from multiple sources into something clear
Creating consistent messaging across different communications
Drafting proposals, quotes, or contracts
Writing job descriptions, performance reviews, or training materials
NOT AI problems:
Anything requiring hands-on work or physical presence
Face-to-face conversations (though AI can help you prep)
Making judgment calls about people or situations
Creative work where your personal voice matters most
Tasks that require real-world context AI doesn't have
Complicated math (which you can do, but right now it takes technical knowle=
dge)
Real Examples by Job Type
If you're in healthcare: AI writes better patient notes, helps communicate =
with families, handles insurance paperwork. One nurse told me she saves an =
hour per shift just on documentation.
If you're in retail: AI helps with difficult customers, tracks inventory, w=
rites social media posts that actually work. A store manager uses it to tur=
n customer complaints into training scenarios for staff.
If you're in trades: AI writes estimates, explains technical problems to cu=
stomers, handles scheduling conflicts. An electrician I know uses it to tur=
n building codes into plain English for clients.
If you're in education: AI creates materials, writes parent communications,=
 handles administrative tasks. Teachers report saving 5+ hours weekly on le=
sson planning and administrative work.
If you manage people: AI helps write performance reviews, navigate difficul=
t conversations, organize meeting notes. One manager told me it transformed=
 how she handles conflict=E2=80=94she practices the conversation with AI fi=
rst.
If you're in any service job: AI helps you sound professional under pressur=
e, research solutions quickly, handle complaints without losing your cool. =
Customer service teams using AI handle 15% more issues per hour.
How to Start (Right Now, No Setup Required)
Pick one thing that annoys you about your work week. Something with words. =
Something that takes too long or stresses you out.
Go to chat.openai.com (it's free). Type this:
"Help me [specific task] for [specific situation]. Keep it [how you want it=
 to sound]."
Real examples that work:
"Help me write an email explaining why this project is delayed. Keep it pro=
fessional but honest."
"Help me respond to this angry customer message. Keep it empathetic but fir=
m."
"Help me create a training checklist for new employees. Keep it simple and =
clear."
Yes, I=E2=80=99m the prompt guy. Yes, I can think of a dozen ways to make t=
hose prompts better. I=E2=80=99ve written about it. That=E2=80=99s not the =
point here. Start with something. Don=E2=80=99t be scared to start.
If that saves you even 10 minutes and sounds better than what you would've =
written stressed, you've just proved AI's value to yourself. And if you wan=
t to level up, well you know I have plenty of prompting tips to dig into wh=
en you=E2=80=99re ready.
The Simple Tools That Actually Work (All Free to Start)
Start here - pick ONE:
ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) - Best all-around problem-solving, most people ha=
ve it in their pockets
Claude (claude.ai) - Good for longer documents and better writer
Google Gemini - Great alternative, excellent at images
Grammarly - Makes everything you write clearer (works everywhere)
Otter.ai - Records meetings and gives you summary notes
Once you're comfortable, add these:
Zapier - Connects your apps (like "when I get an email, add it to my spread=
sheet")
Notion AI - Helps write and organize within your workspace
Canva AI - Creates graphics from descriptions ("make me a flyer for a plumb=
ing business special")
The key: Master one tool for one problem before adding another. No tool jus=
t because.
The Real Risk
Here's what I've learned from watching thousands of people make this transi=
tion: the fear of AI is always worse than the reality of using it.
You discover it's not some scary robot overlord. It's just a really good wr=
iting assistant. Like spell-check, but for entire thoughts.
The biggest risk isn't using AI badly. It's letting everyone else get comfo=
rtable with it while you don't. Six months from now, the people using AI ef=
fectively are going to be handling the same workload with half the stress. =
They're going to sound more professional, follow up more consistently, and =
go home with more energy.
Not because they became tech people. But because they recognized which prob=
lems were word problems and used the word-problem solver.
The numbers don't lie: AI use at work has nearly doubled in two years, from=
 21% to 40% of employees. Daily use has doubled in just the past 12 months.=
 The train is leaving the station.
A Note to My Regular Readers (And a Request)
AI is a general purpose technology. It touches all of us.
So I've always tried to write for everyone=E2=80=94from the AI engineer to =
the small business owner to the exhausted parent trying to keep up. But Nex=
Gen Caveman's message reminded me to let you all know that technical knowle=
dge is absolutely not a barrier to trying AI!
Have you noticed the beginner=E2=80=99s corners this week? I=E2=80=99m doub=
ling down on making sure there are useful nuggets in my posts for someone w=
ho's new to AI.
Because while some of you are definitely building RAG systems or fine-tunin=
g models, someone in your life=E2=80=94your dad, your friend, your coworker=
=E2=80=94is still struggling with basic communication tasks that AI could s=
olve in seconds.
If you're technically advanced, this article might seem basic to you. That'=
s the point. Share it with someone who needs it. Your cousin who runs a sma=
ll business. Your friend who's drowning in administrative work. Your parent=
 who's intimidated by technology but could really use the help.
Because NexGen Caveman had it right in his postscript. He's already using A=
I, adding his own twist, making it work for him. That's not despite his lac=
k of technical knowledge=E2=80=94it's because he focused on solving his act=
ual problem instead of understanding the underlying technology.
The Bottom Line
The global AI market is projected to reach $391 billion in 2025, with 97 mi=
llion people working in AI-related roles. 378 million users are expected to=
 adopt AI globally by 2025. But those numbers mean nothing if regular worki=
ng people can't access the benefits.
The tools are simple. The applications are obvious once you see them. And t=
he people who adapt aren't the ones with computer science degrees=E2=80=94t=
hey're the ones willing to try something new when it makes their life easie=
r.
Up to 80% of U.S. workers might have at least 10% of their work activities =
affected by AI. But effect isn't the same as replacement=E2=80=94it's augme=
ntation. The question is whether you'll be the one controlling the AI or wa=
tching others benefit while you struggle with the same old problems.
Next time someone tells you they're "not technical enough for AI," show the=
m this. Remind them that if they can identify a problem involving words, th=
ey're technical enough.
The getting started solution is simpler than most people expect. And they d=
eserve to know that.
P.S. NexGen Caveman, if you're reading this=E2=80=94you're already ahead of=
 most people. That instinct to use AI for what you needed, then add your ow=
n twist? That's exactly how this is supposed to work. Keep asking the real =
questions. The rest of us are learning from you too.
