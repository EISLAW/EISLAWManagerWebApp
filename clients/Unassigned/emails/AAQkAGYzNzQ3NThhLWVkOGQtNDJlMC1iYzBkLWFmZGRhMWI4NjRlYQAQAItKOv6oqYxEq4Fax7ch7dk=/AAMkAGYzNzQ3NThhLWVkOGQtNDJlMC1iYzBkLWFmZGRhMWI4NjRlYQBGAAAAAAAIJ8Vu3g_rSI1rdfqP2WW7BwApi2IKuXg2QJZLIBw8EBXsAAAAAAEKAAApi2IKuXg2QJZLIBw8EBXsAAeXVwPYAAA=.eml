-a-20-prompt-set-to-kill-ai

AI slop is killing companies.
In the last 2 years we=E2=80=99ve taken the cost of content down to zero, s=
o the supply of content has gone through the roof.
There=E2=80=99s not time to read it all. So we don=E2=80=99t. We complain a=
bout it, but we think ther=E2=80=99es nothing we can do.
Not anymore! I=E2=80=99ve been staring at the problem for months, and I fin=
ally realized there=E2=80=99s a way to use AI to fight slop here. A really =
sharp prompt, thoughtfully deployed, can vastly simplify the review process=
 for artifacts at work, turning an impossible pipeline of content into a se=
lf-policing feedback loop.
Imagine if instead of wondering if an AI has written a good or bad Product =
Requirements Document and having to read it line by line you could get a qu=
ick read and feedback instantly from a prompt! Same with blog posts. Same w=
ith customer emails. You get the idea. It=E2=80=99s going to save your team=
 DAYS.
Here=E2=80=99s the full list of anti-slop editor prompts I built:
The High-Volume Explosion (10-100x increase):
Blog posts and articles
Social media content (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
Email campaigns and sequences
Sales outreach (cold emails)
Ad copy (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)
Support responses
Product descriptions
Meeting summaries
Video scripts
SEO content briefs
Landing page copy
Follow-up emails
Case study drafts
Email newsletter content
Internal communications (Slack responses, etc.)
The High-Impact Category (lower volume but expensive when bad):=20
16. PRDs and feature specs=20
17. Technical documentation=20
18. Executive memos=20
19. Client deliverables and reports=20
20. Proposals and pitch decks
Quite a list! Look, the point is NOT to stop human eyes or human reviews.
The point is to make human reviews matter more.=20
Andrej Karpathy said something that=E2=80=99s stuck in my mind for months:=
=E2=80=9C99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attenti=
on=E2=80=9D (March 12, 2025 tweet).
He=E2=80=99s right. And I think we need to start building systems that assu=
me that the human attention needs to be on the correct 0.1% (or 1% if we=E2=
=80=99re aggressive) of work.=20
That=E2=80=99s what this prompt system is designed to do for you. Put your =
human attention where it matters most. Incidentally, by doing this you get =
all sorts of benefits!
As a writer, you learn to write better, because you have a clean feedback l=
oop from prompt to artifact to specific, actionable feedback
As a professional, the AI learns to work with you better (especially system=
s with memory) as you use this system
As a manager, your team can save you work by doing first round themselves
As leader, you can save your teams days of work and increase quality with t=
his system
 As an agentic systems builder, you get some seed prompts you can use to co=
nstruct automated pipelines to tackle this stuff
It all rests on having an excellent quality gate, and that=E2=80=99s what I=
=E2=80=99ve focused on here.=20
Have fun, and go kill some slop today :)
PS. If you=E2=80=99re wondering if I used a prompt to check my work and hel=
p with this article, the answer is yes! Working with a prompt improved my w=
riting significantly.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Grab the full prompt set for fixing slop here [ https://substack.com/redire=
ct/11f33261-3ecc-4ef9-bfd7-7e2dcfa2f78a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPm=
LQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These 20 prompts are designed to cover the top 20 most sloppy artifacts in =
the workplace. You can read on to see what=E2=80=99s driving slop, where we=
 are trying to address the problem today, and a full discussion of why I pi=
cked the 20 prompts.=20
To use these, just pull the prompt for your artifact (search for what you w=
ant on the page=E2=80=9420 is a lot), paste it into a thinking model like G=
PT-5 or Claude 4.5, and add the artifact you want to check.
If you want to modify the prompt, they=E2=80=99re all in a consistent forma=
t (discussed below) so you can modify them easily.
The AI Slop Problem Is Fixable
Every business I talk to has the same problem, and they don=E2=80=99t know =
how to name it. Their content marketing team went from publishing one blog =
post a week to ten posts a day. Their sales team went from sending 10 perso=
nalized emails daily to 100. Their social media manager went from 5 posts a=
 week to 50.
And nobody knows if any of it is any good. Because nobody has time.
And we=E2=80=99re all acting like it isn=E2=80=99t fixable=E2=80=94you need=
 to believe we can fix it! And it doesn=E2=80=99t take hero ball or best in=
tentions. It just takes smart LLMs deployed with good prompts. Yes, we can =
take AI to fight AI slop lol
Let me show you what this looks like in practice. The data is stark: 93% of=
 marketers now use AI to generate content, with teams reporting they save a=
n average of 3 hours per piece of content (Synthesia, 2025). Content volume=
 has exploded=E2=80=94organizations that used to produce 60 blog posts a ye=
ar are now producing 480+, an 8x increase with the same headcount.
But here=E2=80=99s the problem: Ahrefs analyzed 900,000 newly published web=
 pages in April 2025 and found 74.2% contained AI-generated content. Only 2=
5.8% were purely human-written. And engagement? Email marketing data shows =
email volume increased 15% year-over-year, but response rates are dropping =
as personalization disappears.
Or take sales: teams have gone from 200 emails a day to 2,000=E2=80=94a 10x=
 increase. The absolute numbers look better because of volume, but response=
 rates dropped from 8% to 2% as generic AI-generated outreach floods inboxe=
s.
This is what=E2=80=99s actually happening. Not theoretical. Not hypothetica=
l. Right now, across thousands of companies, people are producing 10-100x m=
ore content than they were a year ago. And they have no systematic way to k=
now if it=E2=80=99s good.
Why This Is Happening (It=E2=80=99s Not Just =E2=80=9CAI Exists=E2=80=9D)
The obvious answer is =E2=80=9Cbecause AI makes it easy.=E2=80=9D That=E2=
=80=99s true but shallow. Let me show you the deeper forces at work. We ten=
d to complain about AI slop (fair) but not take the time to understand why =
it=E2=80=99s occurring=E2=80=94and that=E2=80=99s key to fixing it.
The economics changed. The marginal cost of producing content went to near-=
zero. It used to cost real money and time to produce a blog post=E2=80=94ma=
ybe $500 in labor, four hours of someone=E2=80=99s day. Now it costs $0.20 =
in API calls and 10 minutes. When something becomes 100x cheaper, people pr=
oduce 100x more of it. That=E2=80=99s not laziness, that=E2=80=99s economic=
s. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman predicts =E2=80=9Cnear-zero marginal c=
ost for new knowledge production=E2=80=9D is arriving within 15-20 years=E2=
=80=94we=E2=80=99re already seeing it happen.
The incentives are backwards. Volume metrics are easy to measure=E2=80=94nu=
mber of blog posts published, number of emails sent, number of social posts=
 live. Quality metrics are hard=E2=80=94engagement rates, conversion rates,=
 actual business outcomes. So people optimize for what=E2=80=99s measured. =
=E2=80=9CWe published 200 pieces of content this quarter=E2=80=9D sounds be=
tter in a performance review than =E2=80=9Cwe published 20 pieces of conten=
t and three of them actually drove deals.=E2=80=9D
Competitive pressure is real. Your competitors are publishing 10x more cont=
ent. Your sales team sees competitors sending more emails. Your social team=
 sees other companies posting constantly. There=E2=80=99s genuine fear: =E2=
=80=9CWhat if we miss opportunities by not producing more?=E2=80=9D Nobody =
wants to be the company that lost deals because they didn=E2=80=99t publish=
 enough content. Even if that=E2=80=99s not how it works.
The tools make it trivial. I can open Claude right now and say =E2=80=9Cwri=
te me 50 blog post drafts about enterprise software trends=E2=80=9D and get=
 them in three minutes. The friction disappeared. There=E2=80=99s no natura=
l brake on production anymore. It used to be that writing was hard, so you =
only wrote when you had something to say. Now writing is easy, so you write=
 all the time.
Platform algorithms reward volume. LinkedIn=E2=80=99s algorithm favors acco=
unts that post frequently. Google rewards sites that publish regularly. Soc=
ial media platforms want engagement, and more posts mean more chances to ge=
t engagement. The platforms themselves incentivize volume over quality. Som=
e platforms like Mediavine have started terminating accounts for AI content=
 overuse, but that=E2=80=99s the exception, not the rule.
Loss aversion kicks in. =E2=80=9CWhat if the one post I didn=E2=80=99t publ=
ish would have gone viral?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhat if the one email I didn=
=E2=80=99t send was the one that would have gotten a response?=E2=80=9D Bet=
ter to send everything and see what sticks. This is the same psychology tha=
t makes people buy lottery tickets.
Put these forces together and you get what we=E2=80=99re seeing: an explosi=
on of content production with no corresponding increase in quality control =
capacity. Human attention didn=E2=80=99t scale. We still have 24 hours in a=
 day. We still have the same number of managers who can review content. But=
 production scaled 100x.
That creates a fundamental mismatch.
What People Are Trying (And Why It Doesn=E2=80=99t Work)
Everyone I talk to knows they have a slop problem. They=E2=80=99re trying t=
o solve it. Here=E2=80=99s what they=E2=80=99re doing, and why each approac=
h fails:
Approach 1: Blame the writers
=E2=80=9CJust write better.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThink before you use AI.=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t ship garbage.=E2=80=9D
This doesn=E2=80=99t work because it=E2=80=99s not a motivation problem, it=
=E2=80=99s a systems problem. Your writers aren=E2=80=99t lazy or stupid. T=
hey=E2=80=99re responding rationally to the incentives you=E2=80=99ve set u=
p. You=E2=80=99re measuring them on volume, giving them tools that make vol=
ume easy, and not giving them any systematic way to evaluate quality before=
 shipping.
Telling someone to =E2=80=9Cwrite better=E2=80=9D without defining what bet=
ter means, without giving them objective feedback, without changing the inc=
entives=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s just hoping really hard that the problem fix=
es itself.
Approach 2: Training programs
=E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s run a workshop on quality content.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=
=9CHere=E2=80=99s what good blog posts look like.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CReview =
these examples.=E2=80=9D
Training helps for about three weeks. Then people forget. Then they=E2=80=
=99re back to using AI to generate content quickly because that=E2=80=99s w=
hat the job demands. And training doesn=E2=80=99t scale=E2=80=94you can tra=
in 20 people, but when they=E2=80=99re each producing 50 pieces of content =
a month, you can=E2=80=99t individually coach each piece.
The data backs this up: BCG found 74% of companies struggle to achieve and =
scale AI value despite training efforts. Organizations that invest in train=
ing employees on AI see only 43% higher success rates in deploying projects=
=E2=80=94better than nothing, but far from a solution.
Also, training is vague. =E2=80=9CWrite with more specificity=E2=80=9D soun=
ds clear until someone asks =E2=80=9Chow much specificity?=E2=80=9D and you=
 realize you don=E2=80=99t have an objective answer.
Approach 3: Style tools like Grammarly or Acrolinx
=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll use enterprise content tools to enforce quality.=E2=
=80=9D
These tools catch typos. They enforce brand voice. They=E2=80=99ll tell you=
 not to use =E2=80=9Cutilize=E2=80=9D when you mean =E2=80=9Cuse.=E2=80=9D =
Great.
But they=E2=80=99ll happily approve a blog post that says =E2=80=9Cmany ent=
erprise customers see significant ROI improvements=E2=80=9D with zero custo=
mer names, zero specific numbers, zero proof points. They=E2=80=99ll approv=
e a sales email that starts with =E2=80=9CI hope this email finds you well=
=E2=80=9D and has zero personalization beyond the company name.
Style doesn=E2=80=99t equal substance. Grammar doesn=E2=80=99t equal useful=
ness. These tools optimize for the wrong thing.
Approach 4: AI detectors
=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll use AI detection tools to catch AI-generated content=
=2E=E2=80=9D
Even if these worked=E2=80=94and they don=E2=80=99t. The FTC v. Workado ord=
er (April 2025) found AI detection tools claiming 98% accuracy actually ach=
ieved only 53% accuracy on general-purpose content=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Dno bett=
er than a coin flip,=E2=80=9D according to the FTC=E2=80=99s own language. =
That=E2=80=99s literally worse than random guessing.
But even if they worked perfectly, so what? Bad writing has existed forever=
=2E I=E2=80=99ve seen terrible, vague, use=
less PRDs for a decade before AI ex=
isted. I don=E2=80=99t care if a human or an AI wrote =E2=80=9CRecently, we=
=E2=80=99ve seen increased customer demand.=E2=80=9D I care that it=E2=80=
=99s temporally vague and tells me nothing actionable.
Detecting authorship doesn=E2=80=99t solve the quality problem. It just let=
s you blame the right party for the garbage.
Approach 5: Manual review
=E2=80=9CAll content gets reviewed by a manager before it goes live.=E2=80=
=9D
Now your manager spends 25 hours a week reading blog posts and sales emails=
=2E They burn out. They start skimmin=
g. They give vague feedback like =E2=80=
=9Cmake it better=E2=80=9D because they don=E2=80=99t have time to be speci=
fic about what=E2=80=99s wrong with 40 different blog posts.
Or they give up and approve everything because the alternative is becoming =
a bottleneck that blocks the entire team.
Manual review worked when each person produced one blog post a week. It doe=
sn=E2=80=99t work when each person produces ten blog posts a week. The math=
 doesn=E2=80=99t work. Human attention can=E2=80=99t scale to match AI prod=
uction.
Why they all fail: Each approach assumes human attention can keep up with A=
I production. That=E2=80=99s the wrong assumption.
The Real Problem: Attention Economics Broke
Here=E2=80=99s what actually happened: we moved from a world where human at=
tention was the bottleneck to a world where human attention is a luxury goo=
d.
Think about it in economic terms. Production capacity for content increased=
 100x overnight. But consumption capacity=E2=80=94human attention=E2=80=94s=
tayed flat. Supply exploded. Demand stayed constant. That creates a fundame=
ntal mismatch.
Before AI:
Your team produces 60 blog posts a year
Your manager can read all 60 before they publish
Quality control scales naturally
After AI:
Your team produces 480 blog posts a year (or 4,800)
Your manager can still only read 60
Quality control breaks
You have three options:
Read everything (impossible, burns out managers)
Read nothing (garbage ships, quality craters)
Read randomly (some garbage gets caught, most doesn=E2=80=99t)
None of these work. What you need is option four: systematically filter the=
 content so human attention goes to the 1% that matters.
Andrej Karpathy said something that crystallized this for me. He said =E2=
=80=9C99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attention=
=E2=80=9D (March 12, 2025 tweet). That=E2=80=99s exactly right. The questio=
n isn=E2=80=99t whether to use AI attention. It=E2=80=99s how to use it cor=
rectly.
You need AI attention to match AI production. If AI is creating 100x more c=
ontent, you need AI to read 98% of it and surface the 1% that needs human r=
eview.
But=E2=80=94and this is crucial=E2=80=94you can=E2=80=99t just ask =E2=80=
=9Cis this good?=E2=80=9D and expect useful answers.
Why =E2=80=9CIs This Good?=E2=80=9D Doesn=E2=80=99t Work
I=E2=80=99ve seen dozens of companies try this. They tell their teams: =E2=
=80=9CBefore you publish, paste it into ChatGPT and ask if it=E2=80=99s goo=
d.=E2=80=9D
It doesn=E2=80=99t work. Here=E2=80=99s why:
First, =E2=80=9Cgood=E2=80=9D means different things for different content =
types. A good blog post has specific proof points and concrete examples. A =
good PRD has testable acceptance criteria and clear dependencies. A good sa=
les email has personalization signals and a low-friction ask. These are com=
pletely different quality standards. Asking a generic =E2=80=9Cis this good=
?=E2=80=9D applies no standard at all.
Second, LLMs will say almost anything is good if you ask them generically. =
They=E2=80=99re optimized to be helpful and agreeable. They=E2=80=99ll find=
 something nice to say about almost any content. =E2=80=9CThis blog post ha=
s a clear structure and uses professional language=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t=
 tell you if it=E2=80=99s actually useful.
Third, the feedback is too vague to act on. =E2=80=9CThis could be more spe=
cific=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CConsider adding more detail=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=
=99t tell you what to do. Where should it be more specific? What kind of de=
tail? How much?
What you need is function-specific quality evaluation with concrete rubrics=
 and actionable feedback. Not =E2=80=9Cis this good?=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9C=
does this have the structural elements that make it useful for its purpose?=
=E2=80=9D
The Solution: Function-Specific Quality Gates
Here=E2=80=99s the insight: you need different quality filters for differen=
t content types, each evaluating on the dimensions that actually matter for=
 that purpose.
A blog post without specific examples and proof points isn=E2=80=99t credib=
le. A sales email without personalization is spam. A PRD without acceptance=
 criteria wastes engineering time. These are different failure modes. You n=
eed different evaluators.
Let me show you how this works with the content type where volume exploded =
the most: blog posts.
How to Actually Evaluate a Blog Post
When I built the blog post evaluator, I started by asking: what makes a blo=
g post actually useful versus generic slop?
The answer isn=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cgood grammar=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cclear w=
riting.=E2=80=9D Those are table stakes. The answer is specificity and proo=
f. Can a reader verify what you=E2=80=99re claiming? Can they act on it? Or=
 is it just corporate word soup?
I evaluate blog posts on five dimensions:
Specificity: Are there real examples? Actual numbers? Concrete instances? O=
r is it all =E2=80=9Cmany customers=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Csignificant impro=
vements=E2=80=9D? A score of five means at least three specific examples wi=
th names, numbers, or dates. A score of zero means entirely generic=E2=80=
=94no concrete evidence anywhere.
Proof density: Are claims backed by data, customer quotes, case studies, or=
 screenshots? Can the reader verify what you=E2=80=99re saying? A score of =
five means every major claim has evidence. A score of zero means all assert=
ions, no backing.
Positioning clarity: Is it immediately obvious who this is for and what pro=
blem it solves? Within the first two paragraphs, can a reader tell if this =
is relevant to them? A score of five means first paragraph names the audien=
ce, problem, and solution. A score of zero means unclear who should care.
Differentiation: Does it explain why not a competitor or the status quo? Is=
 there a unique point of view? A score of five explains what alternatives m=
iss and why this matters. A score of zero could be about any product=E2=80=
=94nothing distinctive.
Call-to-action: Is the next step clear and low-friction? A score of five me=
ans specific next step that matches reader intent. A score of zero means no=
 CTA or it=E2=80=99s buried and vague.
Here=E2=80=99s what I tell the evaluator to flag as anti-patterns:
=E2=80=9CBest-in-class=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cindustry-leading=E2=80=9D witho=
ut proof
Metrics with no denominator: =E2=80=9C40% faster=E2=80=9D (faster than what=
? measured how?)
=E2=80=9CTrusted by 1000+ companies=E2=80=9D without naming any
Generic pain points: =E2=80=9Csave time and money=E2=80=9D (every product c=
laims this)
Then I ask for specific, actionable feedback. Not =E2=80=9Cthis needs more =
specificity=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9CParagraph 3 says =E2=80=98many enterprise=
 customers saw significant ROI.=E2=80=99 Replace with: =E2=80=98Acme Corp r=
educed manual data entry from 14 hours per week to 2 hours per week within =
3 months (source: case study link).=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D
That=E2=80=99s feedback someone can actually use. It=E2=80=99s specific abo=
ut location, explains the problem, shows exactly how to fix it, and explain=
s why it matters.
Here=E2=80=99s the key: this isn=E2=80=99t just filtering. It=E2=80=99s tea=
ching. When someone gets this feedback three times, they start internalizin=
g the pattern. =E2=80=9COh, I need actual customer names. I need specific n=
umbers with context. I need proof points, not assertions.=E2=80=9D
The Pattern Across Other Content Types
Once you see how it works for blog posts, the pattern becomes clear for oth=
er content types.
Sales outreach gets evaluated on personalization depth (evidence of researc=
h beyond company name), problem hypothesis (specific guess at their pain po=
int), relevance signal (why now=E2=80=94funding, hiring, expansion), value =
clarity (stated in their outcomes, not your features), and ask size (low-fr=
iction, not =E2=80=9C30 min demo=E2=80=9D on cold email).
What kills sales outreach? =E2=80=9CI hope this email finds you well.=E2=80=
=9D Generic pain points that could apply to any company. High-friction asks=
=2E Could be sent to a thousand people=20=
with find-replace. The evaluator flags=
 all of this and says: =E2=80=9COpening line: replace generic greeting with=
 =E2=80=98I saw Acme just posted 4 SDR roles=E2=80=94congrats on the growth=
!=E2=80=99 to show you did research.=E2=80=9D
Email campaigns get evaluated on subject line specificity (does it make a c=
oncrete promise), personalization signals (segmentation beyond =E2=80=9CHi =
{FirstName}=E2=80=9D), value proposition clarity (obvious benefit in first =
sentence), social proof (specific customers or data), and friction reductio=
n (clear one-click action).
What kills email campaigns? Subject lines like =E2=80=9CExciting updates.=
=E2=80=9D Opening with =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re thrilled to announce.=E2=80=
=9D No clear reason why this email matters today. Vague CTAs like =E2=80=9C=
learn more.=E2=80=9D The evaluator catches this and provides specific fixes=
=2E
Social media posts get evaluated on hook strength (first sentence earns the=
 read), specificity (concrete example or data point), insight novelty (is t=
his a fresh take), engagement design (does it invite response), and format =
optimization (breaks, white space, scannable).
What kills social posts? Starting with =E2=80=9CExcited to share.=E2=80=9D =
Vague wisdom like =E2=80=9CLeadership is about communication.=E2=80=9D No s=
pecific examples. Wall of text. The evaluator flags patterns and shows how =
to fix them.
Ad copy gets evaluated on benefit clarity (specific outcome in first 5 word=
s), objection handling (addresses why not competitor), urgency creation (ti=
me-bound trigger), friction removal (what exactly happens when you click), =
and trust signals (specific proof point).
What kills ad copy? Leading with features not benefits. Vague promises like=
 =E2=80=9Ctransform your business.=E2=80=9D No clear next step. Generic tru=
st claims like =E2=80=9Ctrusted by thousands.=E2=80=9D The evaluator catche=
s this and shows concrete improvements.
Product descriptions get evaluated on use case specificity (who is this for=
 exactly), problem-solution mapping (clear pain point addressed), different=
iation (why not alternatives), technical precision (specs without jargon), =
and objection preemption (addresses likely concerns).
What kills product descriptions? Could describe any similar product. No spe=
cific use cases. Feature lists without context. Vague benefits. The evaluat=
or forces specificity.
See the pattern? Each content type has different structural requirements fo=
r usefulness. You can=E2=80=99t evaluate them all on =E2=80=9Cclarity and c=
onciseness.=E2=80=9D You need function-specific rubrics that check: does th=
is have what it needs to actually work?

shgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Based on what I=E2=80=99m seeing across companies, here=E2=80=99s where the=
 volume explosion is actually happening and where you need quality filters:
The High-Volume Explosion (10-100x increase):
Blog posts and articles
Social media content (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
Email campaigns and sequences
Sales outreach (cold emails)
Ad copy (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)
Support responses
Product descriptions
Meeting summaries
Video scripts
SEO content briefs
Landing page copy
Follow-up emails
Case study drafts
Email newsletter content
Internal communications (Slack responses, etc.)
The High-Impact Category (lower volume but expensive when bad):
PRDs and feature specs
Technical documentation
Executive memos
Client deliverables and reports
Proposals and pitch decks
The first 15 are where you=E2=80=99re drowning in volume and can=E2=80=99t =
possibly read everything. You need AI to filter so you=E2=80=99re only read=
ing the top 2-5%.
The last 5 are lower volume but when they=E2=80=99re bad, the cost is massi=
ve=E2=80=94wasted engineering time, poor strategic decisions, lost clients,=
 blown deals. You need AI to catch structural problems before humans invest=
 time.
Together, these 20 cover probably 80% of the content quality pain across mo=
st organizations.
What Actually Changes When You Deploy This
I=E2=80=99ve seen companies implement function-specific quality gates, and =
the effects are more profound than just =E2=80=9Cwe read less garbage.=E2=
=80=9D
The most immediate impact is time savings. Research shows that marketers us=
ing AI save an average of 3 hours per piece of content (Synthesia, 2025). F=
or a team producing 40 blog posts a month, that=E2=80=99s 120 hours monthly=
, or 1,440 hours annually=E2=80=9436 full work weeks recovered.
But the second-order effects matter more. Quality becomes measurable for th=
e first time. You can track trends. Is the team getting better at using AI =
to produce good content? Are certain writers consistently hitting 4.5+ whil=
e others hover at 2.8? You have data instead of gut feel.
Promotable work surfaces faster. When quality is visible and measurable ins=
tead of buried in a pile of =E2=80=9Ceverything looks fine,=E2=80=9D high p=
erformers become obvious. You can promote based on demonstrable skill rathe=
r than gut feeling.
Hiring gets dramatically better. Interview candidates by giving them a 2.3-=
scored blog post and asking them to improve it to 4.0+. You learn more in 3=
0 minutes than in three hours of behavioral questions. Who can spot structu=
ral problems? Who gives actionable fixes? Who understands what quality mean=
s?
Real-time coaching accelerates learning. Instead of quarterly reviews where=
 you vaguely remember that blog post from six weeks ago was weak, someone g=
ets feedback immediately: =E2=80=9CParagraph 3 lacks specificity=E2=80=94he=
re=E2=80=99s exactly how to fix it.=E2=80=9D They revise and resubmit. They=
 see their score go from 2.8 to 4.2. They learn what good looks like throug=
h repetition, not through hoping they remember a training session from thre=
e months ago.
Client deliverables become professional reputation insurance. Never ship a =
report under 4.0 to clients. Never send a proposal under 3.8. Your clients =
can=E2=80=99t tell if you used AI, but they can tell if your deliverable he=
lps them make decisions.
Team benchmarking reveals best practices. Compare performance across teams.=
 Is the East Coast sales team scoring higher on outreach emails? What are t=
hey doing differently?
When This Goes Wrong (And How to Catch It)
I=E2=80=99ve seen quality gates fail in predictable ways. Let me tell you w=
hat to watch for.
The most common failure is what I call the override spiral. Managers start =
constantly marking =E2=80=9CREVISE=E2=80=9D documents as acceptable. If you=
r override rate goes above 20%, something=E2=80=99s wrong. Usually it means=
 the rubric is calibrated too strictly or it=E2=80=99s missing edge cases.
Then there=E2=80=99s gaming. Documents start hitting the rubric perfectly b=
ut feel soulless. Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s counterintuitive: this is u=
sually fine. If someone =E2=80=9Cgames=E2=80=9D their way to specific examp=
les, concrete numbers, and clear proof points, the blog post actually works=
=2E Gaming good rubrics produces good content.
The real risk is bad rubrics that reward verbosity. If your rubric incentiv=
izes bloat, fix the rubric. And spot-check occasionally=E2=80=94audit high-=
scoring posts to make sure they=E2=80=99re genuinely good, not just checkbo=
x compliance. But if checkbox compliance still produces useful posts? You=
=E2=80=99re fine.
There=E2=80=99s also resistance. People say =E2=80=9CAI judging my work fee=
ls dystopian.=E2=80=9D This is a positioning problem. You reframe it: =E2=
=80=9CAI is helping you ship better work faster, the same way spell-check h=
elps you avoid typos.=E2=80=9D Show time savings with real numbers. =E2=80=
=9CYou spent six hours in revision cycles last week. With quality gates, yo=
u spend 30 minutes getting it right the first time.=E2=80=9D
Make it opt-in first. Let people self-check before mandatory review. Once t=
hey catch three issues before their manager sees them, they become advocate=
s.
The last failure mode is drift. System scores stay high but outcomes degrad=
e. The team learns to game the rubric while actual quality drops, or busine=
ss needs evolve but the rubric doesn=E2=80=99t. The fix is quarterly review=
s where you correlate scores with business outcomes. If blog posts score 4.=
5+ but engagement rates are dropping, the rubric needs updating.
Watch these early warning signs: override rate trending up means calibratio=
n is too strict. Average scores trending up but outcomes flat means gaming =
or drift. Self-check usage dropping means resistance. Fix implementation ra=
te under 70% means feedback isn=E2=80=99t actionable enough.
Why This Matters (Beyond Just Time Savings)
The deeper issue is that AI broke an informal system that worked for decade=
s.
When production was limited by human speed, quality control was informal. Y=
ou knew who the good writers were. You could read their work. You could giv=
e feedback. It scaled because production scaled slowly. One blog post a wee=
k? Your manager can read that. One PRD a sprint? Engineering can review it.
AI broke that. Production is now nearly infinite. Informal quality control =
can=E2=80=99t keep up. You can=E2=80=99t know who the good writers are when=
 everyone is producing 50 pieces of content a month. You can=E2=80=99t read=
 everything. You can=E2=80=99t give individual feedback at scale.
So you need systematic quality control for the first time. Not because peop=
le got worse at writing. Not because standards dropped. Because the volume =
increased 100x and the old informal system mathematically cannot work anymo=
re.
And here=E2=80=99s the opportunity: the same AI that created the problem ca=
n solve it, if you use it correctly. You need AI attention to match AI prod=
uction. You need function-specific rubrics that define what =E2=80=9Cgood=
=E2=80=9D means concretely for each content type. You need actionable feedb=
ack that teaches people what quality looks like.
The data is clear: MIT found that despite $30-40 billion in enterprise AI s=
pending, 95% of organizations see no measurable P&L impact from their gener=
ative AI initiatives. Only 5% of custom enterprise AI tools reach productio=
n=E2=80=94a 95% failure rate. The problem isn=E2=80=99t AI capability. It=
=E2=80=99s deployment strategy.
This only works when it=E2=80=99s part of a quality culture. Use it as a te=
aching tool=E2=80=94when someone gets specific feedback, they learn. Don=E2=
=80=99t use it as a hammer=E2=80=94consistent low scores after feedback is =
a management conversation. Adapt it to your standards=E2=80=94these rubrics=
 are starting points. Make it bidirectional=E2=80=94people should self-chec=
k before submitting.
The Challenge
We=E2=80=99re living in a world where 1% of human attention matters and you=
 need to put it in the right place.
The alternative is what=E2=80=99s happening now: drowning in volume, skippi=
ng quality control, shipping garbage, burning out managers with endless rev=
iew cycles, watching response rates drop and engagement crater and wonderin=
g why AI hasn=E2=80=99t delivered the productivity gains everyone promised.
Bad writing has always existed. What=E2=80=99s new is the volume. From 2022=
-2023 alone, 15 billion AI images were created=E2=80=94matching decades of =
photography in just one year. What=E2=80=99s new is that informal quality c=
ontrol broke. What=E2=80=99s new is that you need systematic quality contro=
l that scales with AI production.
Use AI attention to filter AI output. Put human attention where it matters.=
 Define quality concretely for each content type. Give actionable feedback =
that teaches, not vague directives that frustrate.
I don=E2=80=99t care if AI wrote it. I care if it=E2=80=99s good.
That=E2=80=99s the standard. And now there=E2=80=99s a way to enforce it at=
 scale.
Stop drowning in the slop.

ney and time to produce a blog post=E2=80=94maybe $500 in labor, four hours=
 of someone=E2=80=99s day. Now it costs $0.20 in API calls and 10 minutes. =
When something becomes 100x cheaper, people produce 100x more of it. That=

=E2=80=99s algorithm favors accounts that post frequently. Google rewards s=

What Actually Changes When You Deploy This</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=E2=80=99ve se=

 more profound than just =E2=80=9Cwe read less garbage.=E2=80=9D</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;"><span>The most immediate impact is time savings. Research shows that =
marketers using AI save an average of </span><strong>3 hours per piece of c=
ontent</strong><span> (Synthesia, 2025). For a team producing 40 blog posts=
 a month, that=E2=80=99s 120 hours monthly, or </span><strong>1,440 hours a=

tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">But the second-order effects matter more. Quality becomes measurab=
le for the first time. You can track trends. Is the team getting better at =
using AI to produce good content? Are certain writers consistently hitting =
4.5+ while others hover at 2.8? You have data instead of gut feel.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">Promotable work surfaces faster. When quality is visible and measur=
able instead of buried in a pile of =E2=80=9Ceverything looks fine,=E2=80=

kill rather than gut feeling.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Hiring gets dramatically bett=
er. Interview candidates by giving them a 2.3-scored blog post and asking t=
hem to improve it to 4.0+. You learn more in 30 minutes than in three hours=
 of behavioral questions. Who can spot structural problems? Who gives actio=
nable fixes? Who understands what quality means?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Real-time =
coaching accelerates learning. Instead of quarterly reviews where you vague=
ly remember that blog post from six weeks ago was weak, someone gets feedba=
ck immediately: =E2=80=9CParagraph 3 lacks specificity=E2=80=94here=E2=80=

 ago.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=

if your deliverable helps them make decisions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=

 me tell you what to watch for.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The most common failure is =
what I call the override spiral. Managers start constantly marking =E2=80=
=9CREVISE=E2=80=9D documents as acceptable. If your override rate goes abov=
e 20%, something=E2=80=99s wrong. Usually it means the rubric is calibrated=
 too strictly or it=E2=80=99s missing edge cases.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =
0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Then ther=
e=E2=80=99s gaming. Documents start hitting the rubric perfectly but feel s=
oulless. Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s counterintuitive: this is usually fi=
ne. If someone =E2=80=9Cgames=E2=80=9D their way to specific examples, conc=
rete numbers, and clear proof points, the blog post actually works. Gaming =
good rubrics produces good content.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=
: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The real risk is bad ru=
brics that reward verbosity. If your rubric incentivizes bloat, fix the rub=
ric. And spot-check occasionally=E2=80=94audit high-scoring posts to make s=
ure they=E2=80=99re genuinely good, not just checkbox compliance. But if ch=
eckbox compliance still produces useful posts? You=E2=80=99re fine.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=

 work feels dystopian.=E2=80=9D This is a positioning problem. You reframe =
it: =E2=80=9CAI is helping you ship better work faster, the same way spell-=

=E2=80=9CYou spent six hours in revision cycles last week. With quality gat=

yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=

advocates.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The last failure mode is drift. System scores st=
ay high but outcomes degrade. The team learns to game the rubric while actu=
al quality drops, or business needs evolve but the rubric doesn=E2=80=99t. =
The fix is quarterly reviews where you correlate scores with business outco=
mes. If blog posts score 4.5+ but engagement rates are dropping, the rubric=
 needs updating.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Watch these early warning signs: override =
rate trending up means calibration is too strict. Average scores trending u=
p but outcomes flat means gaming or drift. Self-check usage dropping means =
resistance. Fix implementation rate under 70% means feedback isn=E2=80=99t =

 that worked for decades.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When production was limited by hu=
man speed, quality control was informal. You knew who the good writers were=
. You could read their work. You could give feedback. It scaled because pro=
duction scaled slowly. One blog post a week? Your manager can read that. On=
e PRD a sprint? Engineering can review it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">AI broke that. P=
roduction is now nearly infinite. Informal quality control can=E2=80=99t ke=
ep up. You can=E2=80=99t know who the good writers are when everyone is pro=

ed systematic quality control for the first time. Not because people got wo=

 100x and the old informal system mathematically cannot work anymore.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

 problem can solve it, if you use it correctly. You need AI attention to ma=
