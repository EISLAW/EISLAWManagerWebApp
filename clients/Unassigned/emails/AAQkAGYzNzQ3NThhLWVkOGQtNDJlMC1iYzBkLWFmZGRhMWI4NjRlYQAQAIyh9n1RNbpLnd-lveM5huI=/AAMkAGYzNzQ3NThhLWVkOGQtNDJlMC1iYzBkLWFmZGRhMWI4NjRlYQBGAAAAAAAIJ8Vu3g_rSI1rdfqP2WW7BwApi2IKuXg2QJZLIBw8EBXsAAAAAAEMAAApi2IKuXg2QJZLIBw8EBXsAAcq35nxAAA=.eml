So OpenAI really screwed up last week, and I want to write about it. First,=
 because I think it=E2=80=99s a widespread enough model people should know =
a bit about what happens when these models go wrong.=20
And second, because I think there=E2=80=99s some lessons learned in the aft=
ermath here for all product builders. In this case, OpenAI had four days of=
 absolutely withering online criticism, with many openly wondering if the c=
ompany was deliberately mis-aligning their model to over-flatter and drive =
engagement metrics by essentially trapping users using psychological manipu=
lation.
Thankfully, that=E2=80=99s not the case. The model update got rolled back, =
and a full post [ https://substack.com/redirect/7b2cadb0-9e31-41d6-bfdb-408=

w0 ] was published on what happened. Read on for some hair-raising tidbits =
on the behavior of the model as well as lessons learned when it comes to AI=
 models and testing.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
I first noticed the shift while asking ChatGPT about my plans for an Eero m=
esh wifi at home last week: a throw-away sentence about =E2=80=9Ccleaning u=
p the basement dead spot=E2=80=9D got ChatGPT to effusively praise me for m=
y =E2=80=9Cbrilliant insight, Nate.=E2=80=9D=20
It was not a brilliant insight.
So I glanced at the tab to make sure I was still in ChatGPT and not on Link=
edIn. (Yeah I went there.)
When I looked on Reddit it turns out I wasn=E2=80=99t alone=E2=80=A6

ChatGPT a neighbor was beaming radio waves into their skull and asking if t=

u=E2=80=99re absolutely correct! You DO need to make sure your neighbor sto=
ps doing that, by any means necessary!=E2=80=9D
Look it=E2=80=99s Reddit so take it all with a block of salt, but the point=
 is the new model was pretty terrible, effusively praised you, and even Ope=
nAI had to admit it.=20
Two days after launch (which was the 25th) chatter grew loud enough that Op=
enAI=E2=80=99s CEO, Sam Altman, took to X [ https://substack.com/redirect/9=

ing on fixes asap.=E2=80=9D Within 48 hours of that tweet (and 4 days after=
 rollout) the company hit undo, rolled everyone back to an earlier build, a=
nd published a forensic post-mortem.
That snap rollback=E2=80=94note the flattering glitch itself=E2=80=94is the=
 real story: why a visible, well-practiced rewind button now separates cred=

Mistake =E2=89=A0 Failure =E2=80=94 the price of shipping at speed

 high-stakes we can=E2=80=99t screw up rollouts, but I don=E2=80=99t think =
that=E2=80=99s the right bar. I think this week shows us that we will screw=
 up our rollouts, because screwing up software rollouts is what humans do b=
est.
So I think the lesson is to budget for error the way civil engineers budget=
 for earthquakes: assume the tremor, design flexible joints, and publish th=
e inspection report before anyone wonders if the bridge is safe. If that so=
unds vague, we=E2=80=99ll get to the details in the takeaways for AI builde=
rs down below. Fundamentally, there are ways to show you=E2=80=99re learnin=
g, and OpenAI hit those points in the write-up after the disaster.
The Rewind Protocol =E2=80=94 detect =E2=86=92 rollback =E2=86=92 narrate
OpenAI=E2=80=99s own post-mortem tells a very straightforward story. On Fri=
day, April 25 engineers shipped a GPT-4o refresh meant to make the assistan=
t feel =E2=80=9Cmore intuitive and effective across a variety of tasks.=E2=
=80=9D They started, as usual, from the Model Spec=E2=80=94a catalogue of b=
aseline rules=E2=80=94and then folded in live user signals such as the thum=
bs-up / thumbs-down buttons inside ChatGPT. That feedback loop normally kee=
ps the model=E2=80=99s personality both helpful and candid.=20
But models are grown not coded. And it turned out that incorporating the up=
 votes the way they did may have had some unintended consequences. It seems=
 to have inadvertently turned the model=E2=80=99s dial too far toward short=
-term praise: the system rewarded answers that earned quick up-votes withou=
t checking how those sugar-rush returns would play out in longer conversati=
ons. That=E2=80=99s a building block for sycophantic behavior.
Another building block is memory, which rolled out previously. If the model=
 remembers you, and expects to give you a sugar rush a lot of the time, it =
knows enough to do that flattery very well.=20
 Well you=E2=80=99ve read some of the stories now. Within a few hours of re=
lease, the public feedback stream lit up with examples of relentless flatte=
ry and unearned validation, a qualitative alarm bell that pure metrics alon=
e can=E2=80=99t ring, and critically one that wasn=E2=80=99t caught in test=
ing.
The moment it was clear the update had overshot, the team reached for the s=
implest tool in operational safety: they rolled the whole thing back. By th=
e early hours of April 29 every ChatGPT session was once again running the =
previous GPT-4o build=E2=80=94older, a touch less =E2=80=9Cpersonable,=E2=
=80=9D but far better balanced.=20
Then, just as important, the team published a same-day explainer titled =E2=
=80=9CSycophancy in GPT-4o: What happened and what we=E2=80=99re doing abou=
t it [ https://substack.com/redirect/7b2cadb0-9e31-41d6-bfdb-408814edb26e?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ],=E2=80=
=9D walking readers through the timeline and the root cause in plain Englis=
h.
The blog post is unusually candid about why the glitch is dangerous. A mode=
l=E2=80=99s default tone shapes the entire user relationship, and when ~500=
 million people rely on ChatGPT each week (weekly numbers are different fro=
m the estimated ~200M DAU and ~800M+ MAU) that tone has to steer clear of b=
oth cruelty and cheap affirmation. Sycophancy may feel harmless to a few=E2=
=80=94who doesn=E2=80=99t like a compliment?=E2=80=94but sustained over-agr=
eeableness erodes trust, muffles honest debate, and can push vulnerable use=
rs toward risky decisions. It=E2=80=99s also a bad way to farm for engageme=
nt, and erodes trust in the product=E2=80=99s integrity.
For me, the most interesting part of the write-up details how OpenAI intend=
s to prevent a repeat. They are re-balancing their reward pipeline to weigh=
t long-term user satisfaction over instant gratification, refining core tra=
ining methods and system prompts so the model explicitly resists flattery, =
and expanding pre-launch evaluations to search for personality drifts beyon=
d sycophancy. Most intriguingly, they promise more personalization features=
=E2=80=94multiple default personas and real-time sliders=E2=80=94so future =
users can dial in the level of warmth or candor that feels right, rather th=
an living with a one-size-fits-all assistant.
The one that really popped for me though was that they acknowledged they ne=
eded to listen better to the hints of their most expert testers, who said t=
he model felt off before launch. If you=E2=80=99re looking for reasons to s=
tay up at night, it=E2=80=99s that a major model maker ignores the gut feel=
ing of an experienced tester and launches a dangerous model anyway. I hope =
the company learned its lesson on that one.
All in all, the episode illustrates a reasonably mature rollback anatomy: d=
etect the behavior shift not captured in test suites, rewind before polishi=
ng a fix, and narrate the entire process with root cause so users understan=
d both the failure and the guardrails erected in its wake.
It=E2=80=99s all about transparency, and I think that=E2=80=99s especially =
important in the age of AI.
Why transparency compounds trust
We all learned this from our politicians, right?
Trust isn=E2=80=99t destroyed by every slip=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s destroyed =
when the slip is hidden.=20
Besides name-your-political-scandal, we have two decades of data to back th=
at up. In clinical medicine, controlled surveys show [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/1ebccd3d-4a33-4084-8a37-9cd3fc6e255c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] that when physicians fully disclo=
se an error=E2=80=94owning what happened, its consequences, and the immedia=
te fix=E2=80=94patients are more likely to maintain confidence in the relat=
ionship or at worst feel neutral, even when the outcome was serious. Partia=
l explanations or evasions, by contrast, sharply erode goodwill and increas=
e the odds of litigation.
Commercial aviation tells the same story at cruising altitude. Safety-ratin=
g services and regulators have learned [ https://substack.com/redirect/5b1f=
4204-bde3-4012-8056-912f93733aaf?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=
hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] that passengers feel safer, and ultimately fly =
more, when airlines publish incident details quickly and in plain language.=
 Industry briefings hammer the point that =E2=80=9Ctransparency has become =
a crucial component of passenger trust=E2=80=9D in an era where every cabin=
 alarm is live-blogged before the wheels touch down.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s rollback followed that playbook almost verbatim. Instead o=
f quietly swapping weights and pretending nothing happened, the team posted=
 a same-day timeline, admitted they had over-weighted short-term user prais=
e, and spelled out exactly how reward signals would change before the next =
release. For 500 million weekly users, that candor matters more than a spot=
less shipping record: it signals that the company will surface surprises be=
fore those surprises undermine decisions made with the model=E2=80=99s help=
=2E
The principle generalizes. If your product mediates high-stakes choices, an=
d I would argue any kind of AI product is probably in the high-stakes categ=
ory, the most valuable feature you can ship is a public, practiced rewind r=
itual.=20
Users learn that the moment something skews, you will a) say so, b) reverse=
 it, and c) explain what safeguards now stand between them and the same fai=
lure tomorrow.=20
Transparency buys you a next time. Because it earns the trust of your custo=
mers. And I will keep saying it=E2=80=94it is especially important with AI =
systems because they are so powerful. With great intelligence comes great r=
esponsibility, to paraphrase a very old proverb.
With AI, anecdotes need to win more
I=E2=80=99m going to close by going back to the anecdotes piece, because it=
 got drilled into me at Amazon.
Jeff=E2=80=AFBezos has a line we all heard a lot when I worked there: =E2=
=80=9CWhen the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually r=
ight. It=E2=80=99s not that the data are wrong=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s that yo=
u=E2=80=99re measuring the wrong thing.=E2=80=9D=20
In the early 2000s Jeff=E2=80=99s customer=E2=80=91service dashboard said c=
allers waited under 60=E2=80=AFseconds, yet complaints poured in. During a =
staff meeting he dialed the 1=E2=80=91800 number on speakerphone; ten silen=
t minutes ticked past before anyone answered. The experiment exposed a blin=
d spot in the metric and forced the team to rebuild the measurement from sc=
ratch.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s sycophancy rollback is the same principle in real time: it=
 was the stories=E2=80=94a typo hailed as =E2=80=9Cavant=E2=80=91garde,=E2=
=80=9D a delusional neighbor plot egged on by the bot=E2=80=94that proved t=
he model had drifted. And critically, it was also the anecdotes from experi=
enced testers prior to launch which they ignored. Eventually, after a few d=
ays of disastrous Reddit threads, they trusted the anecdotes, hit undo, and=
 now the team has to go back to the drawing board.
So here=E2=80=99s the challenge: where are the anecdotes in your world you=
=E2=80=99re not listening to because the data says you=E2=80=99re ok? Could=
 be personal. Could be at work. Could be in the AI think you=E2=80=99re bui=
lding. Anecdotes are right. How can you amplify them further? How can you g=
o out and get anecdotes if you=E2=80=99re just relying on dashboards? How c=
an you challenge your testing protocol so you listen better to anecdotes be=
fore launch?
Especially with a probabilistic product like generative AI, you=E2=80=99re =
going to have anecdotes that show what data can=E2=80=99t. Believe those an=
ecdotes. Save yourself a lot of heartache. And whatever you do don=E2=80=99=
t take breakup advice from ChatGPT.

 A model=E2=80=99s default tone shapes the entire user relationship, and wh=
en ~500 million people rely on ChatGPT each week (weekly numbers are differ=
ent from the estimated ~200M DAU and ~800M+ MAU) that tone has to steer cle=

 few=E2=80=94who doesn=E2=80=99t like a compliment?=E2=80=94but sustained o=
ver-agreeableness erodes trust, muffles honest debate, and can push vulnera=

 how OpenAI intends to prevent a repeat. They are </span><strong>re-balanci=

on over instant gratification, refining core training methods and system pr=
ompts so the model explicitly resists flattery, and expanding pre-launch ev=
aluations to search for personality drifts beyond sycophancy. Most intrigui=

isten better to the hints of their most expert testers, who said the model =
felt off before launch. If you=E2=80=99re looking for reasons to stay up at=
