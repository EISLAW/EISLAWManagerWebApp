SEOUL HOPING FOR A RESTART WITH PYONGYANG [3]
THE NEW SOUTH KOREAN LEADER WANTS TO UNDO THE DAMAGE DONE BY HIS PREDECESSOR.
BY: VICTORIA HERCZEGH
Since taking office in June, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has repeatedly raised the issue of reunification with North Korea. Earlier this month, he ordered the removal of some of the
loudspeakers used to blare propaganda messages across the border into North Korea, then expressed hope that dialogue with Pyongyang could restart. Just last week, he called on government ministries to
implement the “feasible parts” of past inter-Korean agreements, urging the start of a peaceful reunification process. Lee’s efforts represent a marked shift in approach from that of his
predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, who oversaw a serious deterioration in ties between the two Koreas. Since his inauguration, Lee has appeared intent on changing this trajectory, believing a move toward
reunification could help boost trade and investment in South Korea and eliminate the biggest security threat to the region.
Part of Lee’s motivation for embarking on this effort is to reverse the volatile situation in which Yoon left the country and the region. Yoon’s brash rhetoric and policies provoked combative
responses from the North, bringing the two Koreas closer to hostilities than they had been in recent years. Easing tensions could also help stabilize ties with Washington, as U.S. President Donald
Trump has again stated his desire to find a diplomatic path to denuclearizing the North.
However, several obstacles stand in the way of any substantial progress, despite Pyongyang’s recent overtures that signal some openness to dialogue. First, each side has a different concept of what
reunification would mean. In South Korea, the idea has long been established as a national imperative and even codified in the official presidential oath of office since 1972. The path toward
reunification was first described by the government of President Roh Tae-woo in 1989, in the so-called National Community Unification Formula. This approach included a gradual and peaceful extension
of South Korean values into the North, something Pyongyang has entirely rejected. In the decades that followed, this formula remained high on the agenda of successive South Korean presidents, who all
largely regarded reunification as a long-term goal requiring careful maneuvering and patience. Other obstacles include the North’s nuclear program, as well as its authoritarian regime’s
unwillingness to merge with the South. In addition, the cost and difficulty of demilitarizing and economically integrating the North [4], and fears that a refugee crisis could ensue if the border were
opened, have stalled any kind of progress. Still, Seoul has pursued reunification for decades, believing it is the best path to long-term peace.
The U.S. has long supported South Korea in this endeavor. However, its posture toward the North shifted during Donald Trump’s first stint as president. Concerned about the growing nuclear threat and
looking for a foreign policy win, Trump abandoned traditional diplomacy and adopted a more personal approach to the North Korean regime. He repeatedly exchanged threats and insults with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un. In 2018, the two agreed to meet in person in Singapore, just a couple of months after the South Korean president also met with Kim. The North Korean leader was hoping to alleviate
the severe economic sanctions and international pressure his country was under, while at the same time continuing to develop his nuclear program. A year later, Kim met with Trump again, this time in
Hanoi. These exchanges yielded some promising statements about strengthening economic cooperation between the two Koreas and dismantling the North’s nuclear facilities, but no actual results ever
materialized.
Since then, North-South ties have severely deteriorated. In early 2024, Kim declared that the North Korean constitution would be amended to refer to the South as his country’s “principal enemy.”
He also said the North would no longer pursue reunification, calling Seoul’s reconciliation efforts an attempt at regime change. This marked a stark break from North Korea’s previous policy that,
even under Kim, left a narrow opening for talks under certain conditions, including that no foreign parties are involved in negotiations and that U.S. forces leave the peninsula.
In response to the shift, Yoon unveiled his “Unification Doctrine,” a unilateral strategy that reaffirmed South Korea’s territorial claim over the entire peninsula. He suspended bilateral deals,
such as the Comprehensive Military Agreement, meant to reduce tensions. Reports suggest Yoon may have even authorized drone incursions into North Korean airspace, underscoring how his hardline stance
pushed the peninsula closer to conflict than it has been in decades. Meanwhile, U.S.-South Korea military cooperation and joint drills only accelerated Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.
North Korea has long refused denuclearization, seeing nuclear deterrence as vital for regime survival. This stance, and Pyongyang’s resulting isolation, has deepened its reliance on China. While
Russia has also been a key partner for the North, providing food and energy in exchange for support for Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine, sanctions and economic pressures have severely constrained
Russian assistance. Chinese aid has thus been a lifeline for Pyongyang, especially amid food shortages and prolonged economic weakness in recent years. After a short break in their otherwise close
relationship, the two countries have recently revived diplomatic exchanges and praised each other publicly, indicating Kim’s awareness of the pitfalls of pushing Beijing away. Indeed, North Korea
likely couldn’t even support Russia in Ukraine without China’s tacit approval. If Kim reconsiders his rejection of reunification, China will likely have played a role.
The growing opposition earlier this year to Kim’s rule [5], led by chairman of the North Korean parliament’s Standing Committee Choe Ryong Hae, likely influenced Kim’s change of heart on China.
Kim and Choe seem to have reconciled and were seen sitting together at recent events. However, reports indicate opposition within Kim’s inner circle remains over his plan to groom his daughter as
his successor. Kim thus needs Beijing in his corner to stave off any future threats to his reign.
Meanwhile, Lee is still looking for opportunities to restart bilateral talks, hoping to undo the damage done by the previous administration. And some apparent openings have appeared. The North has
begun removing its own loudspeakers at the border, and its recent military drills conducted in response to U.S.-South Korea exercises were scaled down compared to last year.
Lee’s overtures to Pyongyang aren’t just about reunification but also aim to repair relations with the United States, on which South Korea is heavily dependent for military support and market
access. He hopes that opening dialogue with Pyongyang could strengthen his hand in trade talks with Trump by showing that he’s made progress on one of Washington’s top security concerns.
Lee is also hoping to curry favor with Beijing after years of friction over trade and Seoul’s participation in Washington's THAAD missile defense system. Lee recently dispatched a delegation of
officials to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, carrying a personal letter from the South Korean president conveying his hopes of normalizing ties and expanding cooperation on technology, green
energy and supply chains. The delegation also invited Xi to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in October, hosted by South Korea. China, in turn, will calculate its approach to both
Koreas primarily based on its relationship with the U.S., with which it’s trying to negotiate a broader trade deal.
Any form of reunification remains unlikely in the near term. As long as the Kim family stays in power, Pyongyang will be unwilling to give up its regime for a chance to merge into a single state with
the South. This stance could change only under a more pragmatic leader, like Choe, but an ousting of the Kim dynasty is unlikely any time soon. Resuming trade and diplomatic exchanges, however, is a
real possibility, as the North is looking for opportunities to ease its economic struggles and the South wants to strengthen its regional standing. Ultimately, while the broader outcome will
inevitably be shaped by the U.S.-China rivalry, the decision to restart talks lies with Seoul and Pyongyang.

removal of some of the loudspeakers used to blare propaganda messages acros=
s the border into North Korea, then expressed hope that dialogue with Pyong=
yang could restart. Just last week, he called on government ministries to i=
mplement the =E2=80=9Cfeasible parts=E2=80=9D of past inter-Korean agreemen=
ts, urging the start of a peaceful reunification process. Lee=E2=80=99s eff=
orts represent a marked shift in approach from that of his predecessor, Yoo=
n Suk Yeol, who oversaw a serious deterioration in ties between the two Kor=
eas. Since his inauguration, Lee has appeared intent on changing this traje=
ctory, believing a move toward reunification could help boost trade and inv=
estment in South Korea and eliminate the biggest security threat to the reg=
ion.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Part of Lee=E2=80=
=99s motivation for embarking on this effort is to reverse the volatile sit=
uation in which Yoon left the country and the region. Yoon=E2=80=99s brash =
rhetoric and policies provoked combative responses from the North, bringing=
 the two Koreas closer to hostilities than they had been in recent years. E=
asing tensions could also help stabilize ties with Washington, as U.S. Pres=
ident Donald Trump has again stated his desire to find a diplomatic path to=
 denuclearizing the North.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, several o=
bstacles stand in the way of any substantial progress, despite Pyongyang=E2=
=80=99s recent overtures that signal some openness to dialogue. First, each=
 side has a different concept of what reunification would mean. In South Ko=
rea, the idea has long been established as a national imperative and even c=
odified in the official presidential oath of office since 1972. The path to=
ward reunification was first described by the government of President Roh T=
ae-woo in 1989, in the so-called National Community Unification Formula. Th=
is approach included a gradual and peaceful extension of South Korean value=
s into the North, something Pyongyang has entirely rejected. In the decades=
 that followed, this formula remained high on the agenda of successive Sout=
h Korean presidents, who all largely regarded reunification as a long-term =
goal requiring careful maneuvering and patience. Other obstacles include th=
e North=E2=80=99s nuclear program, as well as its authoritarian regime=E2=
=80=99s unwillingness to merge with the South. In addition, the <a href=3D"=

i1oaWdoLWhvcGVzLWFuZC1oaWdoZXItaHVyZGxlcy8" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-dec=
oration:none;padding:2px 0px">cost and difficulty of demilitarizing and eco=
nomically integrating the North</a>, and fears that a refugee crisis could =
ensue if the border were opened, have stalled any kind of progress. Still, =
Seoul has pursued reunification for decades, believing it is the best path =
to long-term peace.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. has long =
supported South Korea in this endeavor. However, its posture toward the Nor=
th shifted during Donald Trump=E2=80=99s first stint as president. Concerne=
d about the growing nuclear threat and looking for a foreign policy win, Tr=
ump abandoned traditional diplomacy and adopted a more personal approach to=
 the North Korean regime. He repeatedly exchanged threats and insults with =
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In 2018, the two agreed to meet in person =
in Singapore, just a couple of months after the South Korean president also=
 met with Kim. The North Korean leader was hoping to alleviate the severe e=
conomic sanctions and international pressure his country was under, while a=
t the same time continuing to develop his nuclear program. A year later, Ki=
m met with Trump again, this time in Hanoi. These exchanges yielded some pr=
omising statements about strengthening economic cooperation between the two=
 Koreas and dismantling the North=E2=80=99s nuclear facilities, but no actu=
al results ever materialized.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Since then, North-=
South ties have severely deteriorated. In early 2024, Kim declared that the=
 North Korean constitution would be amended to refer to the South as his co=
untry=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cprincipal enemy.=E2=80=9D He also said the North w=
ould no longer pursue reunification, calling Seoul=E2=80=99s reconciliation=
 efforts an attempt at regime change. This marked a stark break from North =
Korea=E2=80=99s previous policy that, even under Kim, left a narrow opening=
 for talks under certain conditions, including that no foreign parties are =
involved in negotiations and that U.S. forces leave the peninsula.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In response to the=
 shift, Yoon unveiled his =E2=80=9CUnification Doctrine,=E2=80=9D a unilate=
ral strategy that reaffirmed South Korea=E2=80=99s territorial claim over t=
he entire peninsula. He suspended bilateral deals, such as the Comprehensiv=
e Military Agreement, meant to reduce tensions. Reports suggest Yoon may ha=
ve even authorized drone incursions into North Korean airspace, underscorin=
g how his hardline stance pushed the peninsula closer to conflict than it h=
as been in decades. Meanwhile, U.S.-South Korea military cooperation and jo=
int drills only accelerated Pyongyang=E2=80=99s pursuit of nuclear weapons.=
</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">North Korea has lo=
ng refused denuclearization, seeing nuclear deterrence as vital for regime =
survival. This stance, and Pyongyang=E2=80=99s resulting isolation, has dee=
pened its reliance on China. While Russia has also been a key partner for t=
he North, providing food and energy in exchange for support for Moscow=E2=
=80=99s war effort in Ukraine, sanctions and economic pressures have severe=
ly constrained Russian assistance. Chinese aid has thus been a lifeline for=
 Pyongyang, especially amid food shortages and prolonged economic weakness =
in recent years. After a short break in their otherwise close relationship,=
 the two countries have recently revived diplomatic exchanges and praised e=
ach other publicly, indicating Kim=E2=80=99s awareness of the pitfalls of p=
ushing Beijing away. Indeed, North Korea likely couldn=E2=80=99t even suppo=
rt Russia in Ukraine without China=E2=80=99s tacit approval. If Kim reconsi=
ders his rejection of reunification, China will likely have played a role.<=

e</a>, led by chairman of the North Korean parliament=E2=80=99s Standing Co=
mmittee Choe Ryong Hae, likely influenced Kim=E2=80=99s change of heart on =
China. Kim and Choe seem to have reconciled and were seen sitting together =
at recent events. However, reports indicate opposition within Kim=E2=80=99s=
 inner circle remains over his plan to groom his daughter as his successor.=
 Kim thus needs Beijing in his corner to stave off any future threats to hi=
s reign.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, Lee is =
still looking for opportunities to restart bilateral talks, hoping to undo =
the damage done by the previous administration. And some apparent openings =
have appeared. The North has begun removing its own loudspeakers at the bor=
der, and its recent military drills conducted in response to U.S.-South Kor=
ea exercises were scaled down compared to last year.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Lee=E2=80=99s over=
tures to Pyongyang aren=E2=80=99t just about reunification but also aim to =
repair relations with the United States, on which South Korea is heavily de=
pendent for military support and market access. He hopes that opening dialo=
gue with Pyongyang could strengthen his hand in trade talks with Trump by s=
howing that he=E2=80=99s made progress on one of Washington=E2=80=99s top s=
ecurity concerns.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Lee is also hoping=
 to curry favor with Beijing after years of friction over trade and Seoul=
=E2=80=99s participation in Washington's THAAD missile defense system. Lee =
recently dispatched a delegation of officials to meet with Chinese Presiden=
t Xi Jinping, carrying a personal letter from the South Korean president co=
nveying his hopes of normalizing ties and expanding cooperation on technolo=
gy, green energy and supply chains. The delegation also invited Xi to atten=
d the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in October, hosted by South =
Korea. China, in turn, will calculate its approach to both Koreas primarily=
 based on its relationship with the U.S., with which it=E2=80=99s trying to=
 negotiate a broader trade deal.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Any form of reunif=
ication remains unlikely in the near term. As long as the Kim family stays =
in power, Pyongyang will be unwilling to give up its regime for a chance to=
 merge into a single state with the South. This stance could change only un=
der a more pragmatic leader, like Choe, but an ousting of the Kim dynasty i=
s unlikely any time soon. Resuming trade and diplomatic exchanges, however,=
 is a real possibility, as the North is looking for opportunities to ease i=
ts economic struggles and the South wants to strengthen its regional standi=
ng. Ultimately, while the broader outcome will inevitably be shaped by the =
U.S.-China rivalry, the decision to restart talks lies with Seoul and Pyong=
yang.</p>
