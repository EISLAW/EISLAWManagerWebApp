DAILY MEMO: GERMANY'S SOCIAL SPENDING, JAPAN'S DRONE PROCUREMENT [3]
BERLIN IS LOOKING FOR PLACES TO CUT EXPENDITURE.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
CUTS COMING. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned that Germany’s welfare system is overextended [4] and in need of reform. At a party conference, Merz said the welfare state “can no longer
be financed with what we produce in the economy” but also stressed that his government would not raise taxes on medium-sized companies, despite the vice chancellor (from his coalition partner, the
Social Democratic Party) saying earlier that tax hikes on middle and high-income earners were possible. SPD lawmakers have opposed cuts to welfare programs.
DRONE CONTRACT. Israel and Turkey are competing for a major contract [5] to supply drones to Japan. Tokyo is reportedly considering purchasing the Heron Mark II drone, developed by Israel Aerospace
Industries, or less expensive Turkish alternatives like the Kargu suicide drone, as part of a $6.3 billion procurement program for unmanned systems. The contract is indicative of the growing Asian
drone market and Japanese efforts to boost its military capabilities.
FILLING THE GAP. Iran has established weapons manufacturing facilities in several countries and could open more by the end of September, Iranian Defense Minister Amir Aziz Nasirzadeh said in a new
interview [6]. He did not disclose the locations of the facilities but added that Tehran has also sold and purchased weapons from foreign partners. His comments come after Ukraine’s Foreign
Intelligence Service said [7] last week that Tehran might try to fill the arms gap, left by the 12-day war with Israel earlier this year, with imports from Belarus.
IN THE WORKS. Israel and Syria are in advanced stages of reaching a security deal, Sky News Arabia reported [8]. According to the outlet, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said in a meeting with Arab
media figures over the weekend that a deal would be based on the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two countries. He clarified that the current conditions were not conducive to a peace deal but
that he would sign a security agreement if it were in Syria’s interests.
DRUZE SECURITY. At least 30 armed groups in the Syrian province of Sweida announced the formation of a “Sweida national guard” under the leadership of Druze spiritual leader Hikmat al-Hijri, local
broadcaster Syria TV reported [9]. The group will be tasked with protecting the border and desert areas of the province and preventing the infiltration of other armed factions and the smuggling of
weapons and drugs. It will also work to coordinate the province’s security and military institutions in preparation for their future integration into state structures.
UNEXPECTED WITHDRAWAL. The U.S. has begun a sudden withdrawal [10] of troops from two bases in Iraq. Personnel based at Ain al-Asad airbase and the Victory Base Complex are being transferred to other
locations in the region, including Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Washington has reportedly informed Baghdad that it is accelerating the pullout of U.S. troops agreed to in a deal reached last
September [11] – which was supposed to take place by this December.
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung held talks in Tokyo [12]. In their first joint statement in 17 years, the countries agreed to
establish committees to address common social challenges like demographics and slow economic growth. They also pledged to promote cooperation on hydrogen, ammonia and artificial intelligence, and to
expand their bilateral “working holiday” program.
CHINA AND UKRAINE. China's Foreign Ministry has denied [13] a report [14] by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that Beijing has expressed willingness to contribute troops to a peacekeeping mission in
Ukraine if the mission were deployed under a U.N. mandate. European officials have apparently had mixed reactions to the proposal, given Beijing's support of Moscow throughout the war in Ukraine.
NEW ROUTE. Deliveries of Russian natural gas to Iran via Azerbaijan could begin soon, Iranian ambassador to Moscow Kazem Jalali told Russia’s Tass news agency [15]. He said Iran is holding talks
with Russia’s Gazprom, and nearly all issues have already been resolved, except the price of the supplies. Russia is expected to ship 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas annually via Azerbaijan
beginning later in 2025.
OVERLAND TRADE. India and China have initiated talks on resuming trade through three border crossing areas, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said [16]. During Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi’s visit to India last week, Beijing already agreed to restore trade through the Shipki La pass in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This comes amid warming relations between the two countries
after years of tension over an unresolved border dispute.
CHINA-RUSSIA TRADE. The northeastern Chinese city of Suifenhe, located near the Russian border, is developing a logistics complex [17] to promote trade with Russia and other countries. The project is
expected to cost 120 million yuan (about $17 million).
