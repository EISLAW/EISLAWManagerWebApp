 with your team.
Here=E2=80=99s my embarrassing story: 11 months ago I wasn=E2=80=99t using =
AI at work=E2=80=94at all.
My team and I were building AI products used by tens of thousands of people=
=2E But when it came to using AI in my own job, I was a proud Luddite.
I didn=E2=80=99t want to sound like =E2=80=9Cthe average of the internet.=
=E2=80=9D I was worried that if I let AI tools do things for me, I=E2=80=99=
d lose my edge. When I tried using ChatGPT, I found it disappointing for st=
rategic and innovative work=E2=80=94like consulting a chatty Wikipedia.
Deep down, I felt discouraged that I didn=E2=80=99t know the exact magic sp=
ells of prompting that only influencers seemed to know.
Then my engineering team kicked off a new, paperwork-intensive version of S=
crum for a large initiative that required me to write dozens of detailed us=
er stories. I couldn=E2=80=99t keep up, and all of a sudden I became my tea=
m=E2=80=99s bottleneck.
I did what any experienced product manager would do: I whined and complaine=
d. Eventually my eng manager, Oleksii [ https://substack.com/redirect/1cbfa=
f58-b93e-48d2-912c-3137078f1320?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], took pity on me and showed me how to write deta=
iled, near-perfect user stories with ChatGPT (which I covered in my discuss=
ion on Lenny=E2=80=99s Podcast [ https://substack.com/redirect/a2796b32-2ef=
2-4f51-a8c8-3d6bd00befa5?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]!).
Oleksii instructed me to (1) paste in an example template of a user story a=
nd (2) use speech-to-text as I blabbed on and on about how the product expe=
rience should work. I also ended up dictating the background story of the i=
nitiative to ChatGPT, just like I would at a team kickoff.
ChatGPT replied with user stories that were concise, thoughtful, and airtig=
ht. The edge cases were extremely relevant, as if it had been a member of t=
he team for months. Not only did the results translate my ramblings to engi=
neering=E2=80=99s structured template, but each user story also included st=
ipulations (mobile responsiveness, accessibility, pricing tiers) that I=E2=
=80=99d often forget.
The results were nearly perfect, and my fingers never even touched the keyb=
oard. ChatGPT was exhibiting superpowers I didn=E2=80=99t know existed.
I had a hunch that mere user stories were just the beginning of how I could=
 use it at my job. Could AI help me with higher-level tasks? Could it answe=
r the ultimate question of knowledge work: What is the most important thing=
 I should do next?
I realized that AI tools had felt like blunt, generic instruments because I=
 wasn=E2=80=99t providing enough context. LLMs can be highly effective for =
intelligent knowledge work, but only when we provide them with the same bac=
kground knowledge that any person would need to do the same work.
Recent advances in LLMs allow us to maintain (and grow) this context over t=
ime and across conversations, the same way we might keep a colleague in the=
 loop. And we can even instruct LLMs to use consistent behaviors, values, a=
nd guidelines for interacting with us.
When LLMs have this valuable and ongoing context about our goals, our role,=
 our projects, our team, and our wider org, they become our =E2=80=9CAI cop=
ilot=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94a real thinking partner for long-term, complex work. =
Remember my fear of losing my edge? When we treat LLMs as partners that ins=
pire rather than replace our thinking, our output only gets sharper.

=E2=80=99s the point. As AI tools proliferate and become more capable, our =
AI copilot is there to support us and make us better at our jobs. An AI cop=
ilot can work with us, not just for us. And that can make all the differenc=
e.
Over nearly a year now, I=E2=80=99ve taught workshops to more than 20,000 t=
ech employees and founders on how to leverage AI for complex, innovative ta=
sks at work. I can confirm: regardless of company size, vertical, or fluenc=
y in AI, many tech workers today are missing out for the same reason I was.=
 They=E2=80=99re not giving LLMs the context needed to experience their ful=
l potential.
Below, I=E2=80=99ll share how to change the way you think about working wit=
h AI, and how to practically construct your own AI copilot.
What are AI copilots good for?
Leveraging a copilot isn=E2=80=99t about AI producing perfect answers=E2=80=
=94it=E2=80=99s about getting the most out of ourselves. Daniel Kahneman wo=

 I love his reflection: =E2=80=9CI am not a genius. Neither is Tversky. Tog=
ether, we are exceptional.=E2=80=9D
After we work together to build AI copilots, my students start using LLMs t=
o help them make strategic decisions, brainstorm roadmap ideas, develop the=
ir soft skills, and even support them emotionally. Their copilots challenge=
 their thinking, analyze data, apply decision frameworks, prioritize, and h=
elp rehearse hard conversations.

And yes, AI copilots can also draft PRDs, user research plans, meeting agen=

enerating documents feels like an afterthought.)

With Projects, building your AI copilot is much like bringing on a new team=
mate. Each project is made up of three elements: project knowledge, instruc=
tions, and chat threads. And each of these elements corresponds with a step=
 in the onboarding process:
Hire your copilot: Use instructions to set your copilot=E2=80=99s role, per=
sonality, and behaviors.
Onboard your copilot: Fill out the project knowledge with company and org-l=
evel documents that act as shared context across all future conversations w=
ith your copilot.
Kick off an initiative: Begin a chat thread for each initiative you=E2=80=
=99re working on.
Put your copilot to work: Create simple, conversational prompts.
With this framework in mind, open your favorite LLM (upgrade to paid if you=
 haven=E2=80=99t already), navigate to Project/Gem, and let=E2=80=99s get h=
ands-on.
What if your LLM at work doesn=E2=80=99t have projects? No worries, I=E2=80=
=99ve included a workaround for you at the end of this post.
Step 1: =E2=80=9CHire=E2=80=9D your AI copilot
The first step is to create a new project. I=E2=80=99m naming mine =E2=80=
=9CTal=E2=80=99s AI Copilot.=E2=80=9D Don=E2=80=99t worry about giving it a=
 description.
Inside our project, we=E2=80=99ll =E2=80=9Chire=E2=80=9D our thinking partn=
er by deciding what values and behaviors we want it to have. Like when sele=
cting a colleague or a coach, we=E2=80=99ll choose traits that transcend th=
e initiatives we=E2=80=99re working on, company strategy, or what quarter w=
e=E2=80=99re in.
Projects allow us to do this by defining instructions. Think of these as th=
e =E2=80=9Csuper-prompt=E2=80=9D that the LLM applies throughout the conver=
sation, slightly stickier than any prompts you type into a chat conversatio=
n. (If you=E2=80=99ve worked on an AI product, you might recognize this as =
extending the =E2=80=9Csystem prompt.=E2=80=9D)
To get you started, copy and paste the following prompt into your project=
=E2=80=99s instructions. Make sure to fill in the placeholders with what=E2=
=80=99s relevant to your role:
I am a [role] at [company name], and you are my expert coach and advisor, a=
ssisting and proactively coaching me in my role to reach my maximum potenti=
al.
I will provide you with detailed information about our company, such as our=
 strategy, target customer, market insights, products, internal stakeholder=
s and team dynamics, past performance reviews, and retrospective results.
In each conversation, I will provide you with information about a particula=
r initiative so you can help me navigate it.
I expect you to: ask me questions when warranted to gain more context, fill=
 in important missing information, and challenge my assumptions. Ask me que=
stions that will let you most effectively coach and assist me in my role.
Encourage me to: [list the values and behaviors that make you successful in=
 your role]
I want you to find the balance of: [traits you want in a thought partner an=
d coach that will be both effective and fun to work with]
There=E2=80=99s nothing sacred about this prompt. It=E2=80=99s a starting p=
oint, and you should tweak it over time, according to how you want your cop=
ilot to behave. Maybe you want it to be sassier, or more skeptical of what =
you say. Maybe you want it to be more supportive or perhaps more wildly cre=
ative (or all of the above!). The key is to make it yours: treat these inst=
ructions as a set of knobs you can play with for the lifetime of your copil=
ot.
Step 2: Onboard your copilot
Congrats! You=E2=80=99ve hired a copilot with a stellar personality and ali=
gned values, and now it=E2=80=99s their first day on the job. Time to onboa=
rd them to the realities of your organization, team, and role.
Think: What would you provide to a new teammate in their first week on the =
job, before they=E2=80=99re assigned any particular initiative or responsib=
ilities? What=E2=80=99s relevant to and informs all initiatives that you wo=
rk on? We=E2=80=99ll start by uploading these documents to our project know=
ledge.
Here are some examples of valuable context for your AI copilot:
Your company/product=E2=80=99s landing page (use your browser to =E2=80=9Cs=
ave as PDF=E2=80=9D)
Your company strategy deck (export as a PDF)
All of your customer segmentation and research insights
Research on your competitive landscape
Company vision, strategy, quarterly planning docs, etc.
Company processes
Your team=E2=80=99s org chart and roles
Your team=E2=80=99s past retrospectives
Your last performance review or informal manager feedback
Grab two or three that are readily available; don=E2=80=99t overthink it.
If you don=E2=80=99t have a lot of written documentation available, ask you=
r LLM to interview you to make up for any gaps in its knowledge. Imagine th=
is as having coffee with a sharp colleague a few days after they join the t=
eam=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re probably bursting with questions.
Please review what I=E2=80=99ve shared with you and ask me questions to hel=
p complete your knowledge.
What important information are you missing (company- and product-level) tha=
t you need to help me across all my initiatives, present and future?
Focus more on company, org, and industry level. Focus less on short-term co=
nditions or initiatives (e.g. resources, constraints, or individuals), as t=
hose will change over time.
I want you to ask me these questions sequentially (most crucial questions f=
irst), so I can answer one at a time.
When you=E2=80=99re ready to wrap up the conversation, ask it to generate a=
 document that you can upload to your project knowledge:
Please create a document with the new information you=E2=80=99ve learned in=
 our conversation. Only include new information learned in this conversatio=
n (i.e. that wasn=E2=80=99t already in project knowledge). Don=E2=80=99t ou=
tline any outstanding gaps in the document.
Optimize the document for adding to the project knowledge, so it can apply =
in all our future conversations.
Use exact quotations of my original words for the most salient and importan=
t things.
Once the document is ready, download it as a file, and re-upload it to your=
 project knowledge.
Step 3: Kick off an initiative
Now that your new copilot is up to speed on the big picture, it=E2=80=99s t=
ime to involve it in a specific initiative.
I recommend keeping each initiative in its own chat thread. That way, your =
LLM can track the full context with the least amount of effort from you. Yo=
u=E2=80=99ll use this dedicated chat thread to kick off, brainstorm, and ma=
ke decisions with your copilot. It=E2=80=99s where you=E2=80=99ll update yo=
ur copilot throughout the life of the initiative, and where together you=E2=
=80=99ll navigate the inevitable twists and turns. (Below we=E2=80=99ll cov=
er what to do if you hit thread limits.)
Inside your project, open a new chat thread, and paste in the following pro=
mpt:
Now that you have the context on my company and my team, I want to tell you=
 a bit about the initiative that I am working on and give you the specific =
initiative context.
This is the starting point of what I know, and I=E2=80=99ll be updating ove=
r time as more information and insights come in:
[Share what you know about this initiative at the start in any order.]
I recommend using the dictation feature (built into ChatGPT, Gemini, and M3=
65 Copilot, or found in Claude=E2=80=99s mobile app) to ramble about what y=
ou know to get things started. Let loose about the problem, customer, backg=
round, stakeholders, organizational politics=E2=80=94everything that=E2=80=
=99s on your mind and relevant to this initiative.
Don=E2=80=99t worry about structuring your thoughts in a clean, professiona=
l way. Just get it out there in a stream of consciousness. I find that when=
 I start to talk, I=E2=80=99m reminded of additional details I may not have=
 included if I=E2=80=99d structured my thoughts prematurely.
At this point, people usually ask me what model to select. My answer is alw=
ays: the smartest model available to you at work. We=E2=80=99re not using A=
I at scale here, so get the best brain you can, even if it=E2=80=99s consid=
ered =E2=80=9Cexpensive=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cslow=E2=80=9D by engineering t=
erms. (Your only constraints should be where and how your company allows yo=
u to upload sensitive information.)
To recap: You =E2=80=9Chired=E2=80=9D your copilot with instructions, you =
=E2=80=9Conboarded=E2=80=9D your copilot with project knowledge, and now yo=
u=E2=80=99ve kicked off an initiative in a chat thread. With all this conte=
xt, it=E2=80=99s time for the copilot to dig in.
Step 4: Put your copilot to work
With your initiative thread kicked off, paste the following into the chat:
What is the single most important thing I should do next?
Take a look at the results. Can you imagine sending that prompt to a blank =
LLM chat thread (before you had a copilot)? Since you=E2=80=99ve provided a=
mple context and instructions, your copilot returns thought-provoking refle=
ctions, spot-on questions, and concrete next steps. In my case, since I tol=
d my copilot about my team members and stakeholders, it specifically calls =
out my colleagues by name (!).
When we approach AI as a thinking partner full of relevant context, it can =
serve as endless inspiration. Here=E2=80=99s a list of use cases and exampl=
e prompts to get your imagination going:
Notice how there=E2=80=99s nothing fancy about these prompts. Since the LLM=
 has so much context, conversational one-liners are often all you need. Exp=
ect surprising and delightful moments. In the words of Karina Nguyen [ http=

Other ways to leverage your copilot
Using your copilot to build AI prototypes
Using AI to prototype [ https://substack.com/redirect/24693ce1-6aee-4ad0-9c=
19-6ac26e197784?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tA=
jMRMPOw0 ] shortens the path to making something people want, in three ways=
:
Iterate with yourself: hone your vision
Iterate with your team: keep conversations grounded
Iterate with customers: validate usability and viability
AI tools for building prototypes (i.e. vibe coding) have gotten so good at =
this that the hardest part is articulating what you want.
Since our copilot has been with us on our entire journey, it becomes much e=
asier to come up with a detailed description of our solution. Once you=E2=
=80=99ve converged on a direction, ask your copilot to create a prototype d=
irectly in the chat (e.g. Claude Artifacts or OpenAI Canvas). Continuing in=
 the same conversation thread, fill out the following prompt:
Help me generate an interactive prototype of this idea.
We are going to build only the interactive, client-side prototype version o=
f this (without deep functionality) to serve as a good internal feedback to=
ol that can also help test the usability with customers.
Keep the scope extremely focused on what we=E2=80=99ve discussed explicitly=
=2E =E2=80=9CHappy path=E2=80=9D only for now.
[Optional: I have attached a screenshot of the current interface. Make sure=
 it looks pixel-perfect and as similar as possible to the original.]
Don=E2=80=99t build it yet; make a plan first. If needed, remind me what ot=
her files or images or resources I should provide you to help you do an ama=
zing job.
You can also have it generate a prompt to use in an external text-to-UI too=
l like v0, Replit, Lovable, Bolt, and so on. Just append the following line=
s to the prompt above:
Create a separate document with a prompt that I can directly paste into an =
external AI prototyping tool (all commentary should be outside, so I can ju=
st copy and paste the doc as is). This should be a developer-ready specific=
ation that can be used to build this interactive prototype.
Assume the tool has no prior context except what you include in the prompt.
Using your copilot to build AI automations
AI automations can take repetitive, energy-draining tasks off our plate. Un=
fortunately, they=E2=80=99re not magic genies, and shine under specific con=
ditions. This makes it hard to get started, because the first challenge is =
thinking of a use case that is both genuinely valuable and also a good fit =
for AI automation platforms.
Did someone mention generating ideas based on personalized context? Sounds =
like a job for your AI copilot. You can use this prompt in an existing chat=
 thread or start a new one as a throwaway brainstorm. Either way, it=E2=80=
=99ll base its ideas on your project knowledge:
Based on what you know about me and my organization, please brainstorm five=
 ideas for an AI automation I can build using platforms such as Zapier Agen=
ts/Lindy AI/Relay app/Cassidy AI/Gumloop/etc. Limit yourself to what makes =
sense to build in those platforms.
These should help me, as a product manager, save time on draining yet essen=
tial tasks that take me away from more valuable, strategic, and creative us=
es of my attention and energy.
Ask yourself: What ongoing repetitive work requires some judgment and writi=
ng abilities but not my full expertise and intuition? Put another way, if m=
y company assigned me a junior intern, what would I have them do?
Try to phrase each idea in one or two sentences, exactly the way you would =
in a message asking a junior intern to do something. Additionally, follow u=
p each idea with a brief explanation of why you chose this over other ideas=
=2E Pitch me as the product manager in=20=
terms of business outcomes and the val=
ue of my time.
# IMPORTANT: These should be event-driven AI automations, not batch tasks.
Only suggest event-driven automations that process items one at a time as t=
hey arrive=E2=80=94=E2=80=94with currently available information. Do NOT su=
ggest batch tasks that process multiple items on a schedule (e.g. =E2=80=9C=
every morning, scan all...=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cweekly, compile...=E2=80=9D=
).
[Why: AI automations shine in one-at-a-time, repetitive tasks. They do best=
 when designed for immediate responses to individual triggers.]
=E2=9D=8C WRONG (Batch Task): =E2=80=9CEvery morning, scan all new support =
tickets and summarize them=E2=80=9D
=E2=9C=85 RIGHT (Event-Driven): =E2=80=9CWhen a new support ticket arrives,=
 analyze it and alert me if it=E2=80=99s urgent=E2=80=9D
Before finalizing your suggestions, verify each one:
- Does it trigger on a specific event? =E2=9C=93
- Does it process one item at a time? =E2=9C=93
- Could it run multiple times per day as events occur? =E2=9C=93
If any answer is =E2=80=9Cno,=E2=80=9D revise it to be event-driven.
The only exception to this is if the end-result value is being delivered on=
 a particular timeline, for example to centralize information and reduce no=
ise (e.g. weekly update, daily brief on upcoming events, or weekly digest o=
f changes). If you believe that a use case falls under this exception, plea=
se note your reasoning.
# Examples
Below are examples of use cases where product managers have gotten a lot of=
 value from AI agents. Remember, these are just examples to inspire you to =
think of use cases that make sense for you.
1. Compile fragmented information that would require a lot of clicks:
=E2=80=9CWhen a new message is posted in the #feature-requests Slack channe=
l, distill the customer request into 2-5 keywords. Search those keywords in=
 recent Slack threads, HubSpot conversations, and Gong snippets, and reply =
to the thread with links to what you find.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CEvery morning, scan my calendar for customer calls, and instead of=
 searching the web, DM me with recent interactions from this customer in Sa=
lesforce, Gong, and Zendesk.=E2=80=9D (Example of an exception where the va=
lue is the daily delivery timeline to centralize information.)
=E2=80=9CEvery Monday morning, prepare a competitor activity digest by scan=
ning recent blog posts, App Store updates, and X announcements.=E2=80=9D (E=
xample of an exception where the value is the weekly delivery timeline to r=
educe noise.)
=E2=80=9CWhen a customer churns, post a message in the #churn-lessons chann=
el with recent support interactions, NPS rating and date, and churn survey =
response.=E2=80=9D
2. Boring, Sisyphean tasks with high upside:
=E2=80=9CMonitor the pricing pages of 5 competitors for changes.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhen a bug nears its SLA deadline for the associated customer, pin=
g this dedicated Slack channel and cc each respective customer success repr=
esentative.=E2=80=9D
3. Scanning exhausting amounts of data:
=E2=80=9CDM me when a support case is resolved as a =E2=80=98product confus=
ion=E2=80=99 reason rather than a technical issue.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CPing this channel when you see a feature request that showed up fo=
r the first time.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhen an NPS survey text response is posted in the Slack channel, d=
ecide if it=E2=80=99s clearly a technical issue and, if so, create a suppor=
t ticket in Zendesk.=E2=80=9D
4. Drafting updates:
=E2=80=9CEvery Friday at 10 a.m., write up a summary of progress made acros=
s all teams in our project board, across all epics, changes made to scope, =
and highlighting any timeline changes.=E2=80=9D [Example of an exception wh=
ere the value is the daily weekly timeline to centralize information]
Notice the pattern? Good automations start with =E2=80=9CWhen [specific eve=
nt happens],=E2=80=9D not =E2=80=9CEvery [time period],=E2=80=9D unless the=
re=E2=80=99s specific value in triggering on a daily/weekly/etc. cadence.
Scan the resulting use cases and use them as inspiration. Have a conversati=
on! Engage with the results and push back on parts that don=E2=80=99t sit r=
ight with you. The goal is finding a use case you=E2=80=99re excited to mak=
e happen. With this in hand, turn on deep research mode, and ask your copil=
ot to generate a personalized, step-by-step tutorial [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/43d59e41-4678-4517-9d5c-ad59fe908c58?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] on how to construct the automatio=
n.
Gossiping to your AI copilot
Shit happens. A stakeholder changes their mind, new data arrives, or things=
 turn out to be way higher-effort than planned. One hallway conversation ca=
n upend everything.
For your AI copilot to help you navigate, you=E2=80=99ll need to loop it in=
=2E I call this habit =E2=80=9Cgossipin=
g=E2=80=9D to AI, because I fill in my=
 copilot the same way I=E2=80=99d lean over and vent to a colleague sitting=
 next to me.
I love using speech-to-text here as well: =E2=80=9CYou won=E2=80=99t believ=
e what just happened in my conversation with so-and-so. . .=E2=80=9D That=
=E2=80=99s it. No structured format, no formal update process. Just the exa=
sperated sharing that comes naturally.
Even if I don=E2=80=99t have any action items, my AI copilot remembers and =
references these updates later. Unlike with most coworkers, you can bluntly=
 add:
I don=E2=80=99t want solutions right now; I want you to listen. Confirm wit=
h just a =E2=80=9Cyes.=E2=80=9D
Gossip keeps the context fresh and effective.
Pro tip: I personally use my LLM=E2=80=99s native mobile app for dictation =
on the go. This makes gossiping feel as lightweight as sending a WhatsApp v=
oice message to a friend or coworker.
Habits for getting the most out of your AI copilot
Getting the most out of our copilot depends on us, not the AI. The differen=
ce between an okay AI copilot and an exceptional one isn=E2=80=99t the tech=
=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the habits we build around it.
Cultivating an =E2=80=9CAI mindset=E2=80=9D
Your AI copilot will undoubtedly be delightful, but it most certainly won=
=E2=80=99t always be right. That brings me to the most important component =
of using an AI copilot: our mindset.
Working successfully with a thinking partner=E2=80=94human or machine=E2=80=
=94is about taking the good and disregarding the bad. If our car=E2=80=99s =
driver assist beeps loudly on a wide-open highway, it=E2=80=99s no harm don=
e. We still keep it activated in case it alerts us to something on the road=
 we didn=E2=80=99t see. Or think of your favorite mentor or confidant: we d=
on=E2=80=99t constantly judge if their advice could =E2=80=9Creplace our th=
inking.=E2=80=9D Rather, we focus on the parts of what they say that are va=
luable and inspiring.
Even when they=E2=80=99re wrong, LLMs can be weirdly inspiring and motivati=
ng. Often when I disagree with what my AI copilot suggests, it still gets m=
e thinking. As with any outside advice, it spurs me to crystallize what I t=
hink I should do instead.
It=E2=80=99s up to us to apply taste and judgment based on hard-earned prod=
uct intuition. To quote David Lieb (YC partner and founder of Google Photos=
), =E2=80=9CYour gut is the world=E2=80=99s most sophisticated machine lear=
ning model ever created.=E2=80=9D When working with generative AI, apply yo=
ur craft and taste to identify what=E2=80=99s valuable.
If you=E2=80=99re frequently getting outputs you=E2=80=99re not happy with,=
 ask yourself, =E2=80=9CWhat context does the AI need to succeed here?=E2=
=80=9D or =E2=80=9CDoes it have enough guidance to deliver results?=E2=80=
=9D Since we=E2=80=99re using LLMs for their intelligence (rather than for =
their knowledge), it=E2=80=99s on us to think about what we should provide =
to set them up for success.
To tweak your inputs, hover your mouse over your last chat message and clic=
k the =E2=80=9Cedit=E2=80=9D button (or =E2=9C=8F=EF=B8=8F icon) found in a=
ll major LLMs. Provide a tiny bit more guidance or background information, =
and submit again. If you find the same gap happening over and over again, c=
onsider adding that information to the project knowledge.
Growing your copilot=E2=80=99s knowledge over time
Our investment in our AI copilot also earns compound interest. Beyond regul=
arly providing context in each initiative thread, we can also make sure our=
 project knowledge continues to grow, instantly benefiting current initiati=
ves as well as those to come.
The end of an initiative is a great opportunity to update the project knowl=
edge. Start by sharing the outcome, good or bad. Include any retrospectives=
 your team ran. Turn on speech-to-text and add your personal reflections. F=
inally, ask it to output a =E2=80=9Cnew lessons learned=E2=80=9D document.
You can guess what=E2=80=99s coming next: download the document, and upload=
 it to the project knowledge. When we add real-world lessons to our project=
 knowledge, we accelerate the opportunities for our copilot to =E2=80=9Ccon=
nect the dots=E2=80=9D and surprise us with delightfully wise counsel.
You can think of this as memory, but a transparent, curated memory that=E2=
=80=99s completely under your control for a professional context.
Note: What if you hit chat size limits?
Different LLMs have different context window limits. If you run into a limi=
t, you can use a prompt to have the LLM summarize the conversation so you c=
an start a new thread with the key context carried over.
To use this prompt, hover your mouse over your last chat message and click =
the =E2=80=9Cedit=E2=80=9D button (or =E2=9C=8F=EF=B8=8F icon). Replace wit=
h the following prompt, and hit enter.
Finally, start a new thread using the output.
This conversation has reached its context limit. Create a document that can=
 serve as the initial context for a fresh blank LLM thread. Your goal is to=
 preserve approximately 90% of the conversation=E2=80=99s value and context=
 while reducing its length by ~90%.
Act as an expert handing off to another expert who will help me, and set th=
em up for maximum success, as close as possible to having been there all al=
ong. Tell the new expert what instructions or behaviors to exhibit that I=
=E2=80=99ve implicitly or explicitly requested of you. Tell a chronological=
 story.
Use your best judgment when it would be particularly valuable to use the or=
iginal exact words of either the user or AI.
Skip any context that is already found in the project knowledge or in your =
system instructions, since this will be available automatically to the new =
thread.
Create a second, separate document with what you chose not to include, and =
why.
Where might copilots evolve next?
It feels like we=E2=80=99re only at the beginning. Every day I use my AI co=
pilot, I bump into moments where I think, =E2=80=9CI wish it could just. . =
=2E=E2=80=9D From what I hear from my w=
orkshop participants, I=E2=80=99m not=20=
alone.
Today=E2=80=99s friction points reveal where the real opportunities lie for=
 both founders and incumbents alike, and many startups today are gunning fo=
r these opportunities from different angles. Here=E2=80=99s my wish list fo=
r what comes next:
Make it easier to update project knowledge
Today, I=E2=80=99m the human API between my copilot and everything else. I =
manually recount what happened in conversations, export strategy decks as P=
DFs, and update my project knowledge when I remember to. It works, with a l=
ot of work.
Imagine if your copilot could pull directly from new department templates, =
project management, or team messaging, dynamically updating as your world c=
hanges. I wish it could have all this information without getting confused,=
 overwhelmed, or over-indexing to irrelevant details. I want information to=
 flow the other way as well: what if thinking, planning, and scrapbooking [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/ae1244dc-7aa1-4e50-93b6-9bb26c1f976a?j=3DeyJ=
1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] could happen=
 in the same place?
But what really excites me is transparent, editable knowledge that feels li=
ke a living document. Imagine today=E2=80=99s consumer =E2=80=9Cmemory=E2=
=80=9D features, but with professional-grade control.
I=E2=80=99m inspired by how Cursor works for coding: imagine selective cont=
ext, where you choose which documents and initiatives your copilot consider=
s for each conversation. Sometimes you want one feature initiative to take =
another into account; sometimes you don=E2=80=99t.
I want to benefit from being on a team
What if every teammate joining you had a copilot waiting for them that was =
80% ready to rock? Instead of starting from scratch, picture shared knowled=
ge layers curated by leadership. You=E2=80=99d still have your personal con=
text, but now it sits on top of your team=E2=80=99s collective intelligence=
=2E
New PMs would start with company-specific templates, relevant frameworks, a=
nd real lessons learned. Over time, our copilots become smarter not just fr=
om individual experiences but from your entire team=E2=80=99s wins and fail=
ures.
Push me
Even with the best-constructed copilot, there=E2=80=99s that moment of writ=
er=E2=80=99s block. What should I update it on? What question do I even ask=
? Building the habit is harder than building the tool.
I would love for AI to push me like a sharp chief of staff that doesn=E2=80=
=99t wait to be asked. Imagine checking in based on your calendar: =E2=80=
=9CHey, you have that stakeholder review tomorrow. Want to role-play scenar=
ios?=E2=80=9D Or pushing me to focus: =E2=80=9CThis would be a really good =
time to schedule user research and get input from the sales team.=E2=80=9D
The opportunity isn=E2=80=99t in making copilots smarter, but rather in mak=
ing them more connected, more collaborative, and more proactive. The future=
 of AI at work may be more about asking better questions of us than offerin=
g better answers.
Context changes everything
Using AI at work shouldn=E2=80=99t mean sifting through generic responses o=
r conjuring perfect prompts. The most fruitful way to think about using LLM=
s is like collaborating with an inspirational colleague who knows your comp=
any strategy, remembers that conversation with your manager from last Tuesd=
ay, and can challenge your assumptions when everyone else has gone home.
When we give AI the context it needs=E2=80=94and treat it like a partner si=
tting next to us rather than a magic oracle=E2=80=94we don=E2=80=99t lose o=
ur edge; we sharpen it.

Appendix: What if my LLM doesn=E2=80=99t have =E2=80=9Cprojects=E2=80=9D?
While projects are supported by the major LLM providers on all paid plans, =
many tech workers (especially in Big Tech) don=E2=80=99t have access to pro=
jects as part of the internal tools they=E2=80=99re required to use to acce=
ss LLMs.
If this is you, don=E2=80=99t worry. Projects are not a fundamental LLM cap=
ability; they are a UX convenience.
The simplest solution is to do things manually. Assemble your instructions =
and project knowledge in one long text file. Each time you start a new chat=
 thread, start by pasting in the entire file. This is a decent approximatio=
n of how projects work behind the scenes (and way better than working witho=
ut context). It=E2=80=99s not elegant, but hopefully you won=E2=80=99t have=
 to do this very frequently (more on chat threads later).
For those who want a more adventurous solution: A few Big Tech employees ha=
ve realized that while they can=E2=80=99t access projects, they do have acc=
ess to AI-powered software development environments, like Cursor. They=E2=
=80=99ve realized that those contain all the same ingredients as the projec=
ts feature (knowledge, instructions, and chat threads), and they=E2=80=99ve=
 repurposed these tools as thinking partners (using them with plain English=
 instead of code).
