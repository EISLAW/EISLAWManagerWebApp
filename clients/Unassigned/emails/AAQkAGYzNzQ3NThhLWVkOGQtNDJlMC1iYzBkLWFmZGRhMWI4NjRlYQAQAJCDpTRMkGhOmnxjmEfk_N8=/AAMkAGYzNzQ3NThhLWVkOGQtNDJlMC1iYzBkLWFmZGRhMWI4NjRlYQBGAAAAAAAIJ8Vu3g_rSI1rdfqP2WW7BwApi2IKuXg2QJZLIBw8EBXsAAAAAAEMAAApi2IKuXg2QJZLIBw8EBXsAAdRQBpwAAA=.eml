Why a post about China and the US? Why not stick to prompt packages, Nate?
Because it=E2=80=99s a risky world, AI belongs to all of us together, and I=
 do believe conversations like this one can shift our norms and expectation=
s about AI in ways that are meaningful.
I don=E2=80=99t know if policymakers read this, and I don=E2=80=99t care. I=
 care if YOU read it. I care if you share it (yep, it=E2=80=99s free). I ca=
re if you=E2=80=99re able to have the language to frame up why it=E2=80=99s=
 kind of useless to pretend that AI is going to trigger another Cold War.
It can=E2=80=99t and it won=E2=80=99t because (simply) the technology doesn=
=E2=80=99t support Cold War game theory. I=E2=80=99ll explain why below, an=
d I won=E2=80=99t use words like game theory lol
It=E2=80=99s a short enough read you can dig in while the grill is heating =
up and you=E2=80=99ll have something to chat about to Uncle Fred when he co=
mes over on his 3rd beer (we all have a version of Uncle Fred somewhere in =
the family and friends circle).
Dig in for an honest, nuanced examination of AI=E2=80=99s global implicatio=
ns and some grilled up practical proposals for balancing healthy competitio=
n with necessary cooperation. Not a ton of idealism here, just looking for =
practical solutions in a complex and risky world, and I think we can all pl=
ay a part in finding those solutions, together.
Yep, this post is free for everybody, so enjoy and share around.
As a reminder, my weekly executive briefing comes out this Sunday exclusive=
ly for Executive Circle members=E2=80=94here=E2=80=99s how to upgrade your =
subscription plan [ https://substack.com/redirect/5398e92c-1054-44e6-9637-3=
ff33c1b91d0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRM=
POw0 ] if you aren=E2=80=99t in the crew yet.
And btw it is a fun crew! It=E2=80=99s not just a Sunday reads kind of deal=
 either. Starting this July, we=E2=80=99re going to do monthly office hours=
 for exclusively Executive Circle members. You=E2=80=99ll get a dedicated Q=
&A sessions where you can engage directly with me on the critical AI issues=
 shaping our future. I=E2=80=99ll be getting the first one scheduled by mid=
-July, around the time ChatGPT-5 is rumored to come out, so should be a goo=
d conversation!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
AI's Growing Pains: A July 4th Letter to Both Superpowers
It began to dawn on me when I was reading about DeepSeek's breakthrough=E2=
=80=94how Chinese researchers achieved GPT-4 performance with 90% less comp=
uting power=E2=80=94and I couldn't help but chuckle. Not because it was fun=
ny (ok, it was a little funny), but because it was so predictable.=20
Compute gets cheaper over time. Inference is a spreadable technology. The U=
nited States had tried to slow Chinese AI gains with export controls, and t=
he result was a remarkable piece of CUDA [ https://substack.com/redirect/78=
72b75e-e864-4751-a68c-aeac4a18a8f3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] engineering work that set a new bar in AI eff=
iciency. Export controls for AI are like trying to dam a river and accident=
ally creating a more powerful rapids downstream.
Happy 4th, here we are talking about CUDA engineering lol=20
It feels like an appropriate time to talk about AI governance though. To ri=
sk the cheese factor just a little bit=E2=80=94just like 1776, we're at a m=
oment where old frameworks are colliding with new realities. And some days =
it sort of feels like the way both Washington and Beijing are approaching A=
I is about the same way I approached sharing Legos with my brother as a kid=
 (I was not good at this).
Digging up The Cold War Playbook=20
When you're faced with a transformative technology, you reach for what work=
ed before. The Cold War gave an aura of certainty and structure to a comple=
x global conflict. It made the awesome danger of the atom manageable (which=
 might have been illusory but hey it seemed helpful at the time). Export co=
ntrols, technology denial, massive retaliation=E2=80=94it all made sense to=
 policymakers when the threat was uranium and ICBMs.=20
Now it feels increasingly like we=E2=80=99re back in the icebox of another =
Cold War, with both superpowers doing what feels natural: treating AI like =
it's plutonium.
But the tech is just different. Starting with the userbase: ChatGPT hit 100=
 million users in 60 days and is closing on 1B now. Nuclear weapons took de=
cades to proliferate between countries and required state structures to ope=
rate(-ish). AI spreads at internet speed because it is the internet. It's b=
uilt on the same infrastructure that reduced the cost of global cooperation=
 to basically zero. While diplomats debate export controls, teenagers are d=
ownloading open-source models that can never be classified because the tech=
 moves too fast.
There are 450,000+ AI models freely available on HuggingFace right now. We =
know it, but we don=E2=80=99t think of it in this context nearly enough. Ne=
arly half a million AI models, just sitting there, available to be download=
ed by anyone with an internet connection. American researchers and Chinese =
researchers publish papers together every single day=E2=80=94and in many ca=
ses they work together on these papers! I take it back. The knowledge flows=
 faster than water. It flows like memes.
We Shouldn=E2=80=99t Have Been Surprised by DeepSeek
DeepSeek doing more with less is exactly what we should have expected. It's=
 what humans do. To risk going back to that Cold War history well for a min=
ute, when President Kennedy announced the moon mission, he didn't know how =
to get there, and neither did anyone else. The real innovation would come f=
rom people like Margaret Hamilton [ https://substack.com/redirect/ce31b348-=
1add-48d6-8dc6-f0381446dab8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7=
BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] (who btw is a giant in the history of computing=E2=
=80=94you should absolutely read about her if you haven=E2=80=99t). Constra=
ints drive creativity. Always have, always will.
The performance gap between US and Chinese AI has shrunk from almost 10% to=
 less than 2% in under a year. Not despite US restrictions=E2=80=94because =
of them. Mary Meeker's research [ https://substack.com/redirect/c0e5cc2e-b5=
a6-426a-81c9-dd594cc54076?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] shows this beautifully. We don=E2=80=99t live in a wor=
ld where one country will develop a singleton AI that dominates everything.=
 The tech is proliferating too fast for that. Even Sam Altman doesn't belie=
ve that anymore. We're heading toward a world of many powerful AIs, each re=
flecting different values, serving different purposes.
And that just might be a scarier future to imagine than boring ol=E2=80=99 =
SkyNet, if you ask me.
Everyone Has Opinions
Big shocker I know. But part of why this Cold War thinking is growing like =
a weed is because everyone is leaning into the fears that come from a scarc=
ity mindset. And AI is just too abundant to make a scarcity mindset rationa=
l. Intelligence is free and globally distributed, but most of us aren=E2=80=
=99t ready for it.
I read so many fears in the news from both sides of the Pacific.=20
AI will be used for surveillance.
What about the military applications?
What if we=E2=80=99re wrong and this is a great power competition?
What if economic futures are decided elsewhere because we=E2=80=99re too co=
operative?
Both sides are right to be worried. Both sides are wrong to believe they ca=
n lean in to Cold War playbooks and expect the same results.
The Risks That Don't Check Passports
Remember where you were during 2008? I do. I remember watching financial ri=
sks cascade across markets in real time. No one knew where it would stop.=
=20
A misaligned AI would spread even faster. AI doesn't care if it was trained=
 in Berkeley or Beijing. A cascading cyber attack launched by a misaligned =
AI wouldn=E2=80=99t stop at the Pacific Ocean. In a night mare scenario if =
a human jailbreaks an AI to manipulate financial markets or design novel pa=
thogens, it won't check your nationality before deciding whether you're aff=
ected. (Note I=E2=80=99m leaning into the human cooperation angle here on p=
urpose, because I think it is far more likely for a bit here and we might a=
s well focus on the real risk.)
Chernobyl radiation didn't stop at the Soviet border. Swedish nuclear plant=
 workers detected it first. The 2008 financial crisis started with American=
 mortgages and nearly collapsed Iceland. Truly systemic risks don't respect=
 sovereignty, and AI risks will cascade even faster.
Here's what haunts me: We're treating AI like it's a zero-sum game when it'=
s actually a coordination game. In zero-sum games, my win is your loss. In =
coordination games, we both lose if we don't work together. Stable markets =
are a coordination game. Pandemic prevention is a coordination game. And wh=
ether we like it or not, AI safety is a coordination game.
A Framework for Cooperation
So what do we do? First, we need to be honest about where competition is go=
ing to naturally happen (like it did between my brother and me). Let me pro=
pose something practical=E2=80=94graduated engagement. Think of it like thi=
s: a healthy spectrum of commercial competition on applications, and very i=
ntentional cooperation on catastrophic risks.
Where we might compete: Software. Robots. Cars. Probably planes (the AI doe=
sn=E2=80=99t fly the plane yet but I bet it can soon). Agents.
Where we must cooperate: Autonomous weapons proliferation. Nobody wins in a=
 world where killer robots are cheap and everywhere. Biodefense protocols. =
An engineered pandemic doesn't care about your flag. Financial system stabi=
lity. We learned in 2008 that financial contagion is real. Critical infrast=
ructure protection. Because when the lights go out, everybody suffers.
And Yes There Are Practical Steps Forward
It=E2=80=99s not just pie-in-the-sky thinking.
1. Create an AI Hotline During the Cold War, we had a red phone. When thing=
s got tense, leaders could talk directly. We need the same thing for AI inc=
idents. Imagine a  AI leak accidentally flooding networks across the Pacifi=
c. Without a hotline, we might think it's an attack. With one, we prevent a=
 hot conflict over a bug in the code.
2. Joint Risk Assessment Get the best AI scientists from both countries in =
a room=E2=80=94regularly=E2=80=94and have them list what keeps them up at n=
ight. Not the political stuff. The technical stuff. The "oh shit, the AI is=
 doing something we didn't expect" stuff. Because catastrophic risk is wort=
h everyone=E2=80=99s time.
3. Parallel Safety Standards We don't need identical systems. Think about a=
irlines=E2=80=94American Airlines and Air China fly different routes with d=
ifferent service, but they follow the same basic safety protocols. Why? Bec=
ause nobody wants planes falling out of the sky. Same principle applies to =
AI. Arxiv is a big step forward here=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99re all sharing what=
 we learn as we go, and that keeps everyone safer.
4. Research Transparency Zones This one=E2=80=99s a big speculative, but wh=
at if we could create specific areas of AI research in geographically neutr=
al spaces around the globe? AI safety, robustness testing, interpretability=
 research=E2=80=94these benefit everyone and threaten no one. It's like med=
ical researchers sharing data during a pandemic. Some things are too import=
ant to hoard, and it=E2=80=99s worth dedicating space to this. Is this too =
far afield? Not really. Some of the moves around sovereign AI in certain co=
untries may well trend in this direction.
5. Third-Party Verification Switzerland is famous for its neutrality. Singa=
pore manages to be friends with everyone. We could get neutral parties to v=
erify AI safety claims where those claims are relevant globally. Is this id=
ealistic? Not really. Honestly Arxiv isn=E2=80=99t a state but it sort of d=
oes some of this through peer verification now. I think the most idealistic=
 part is honestly the idea that we could understand our own systems well en=
ough to be able to describe them in ways that are useful for safety researc=
hers to understand=E2=80=94Cold War thinking emphasizes secrecy, and tools =
like Arxiv show that sunlighting AI keeps everyone safer.
Why This Isn't Naive (I Can Hear the Skeptics Already)
"You want us to cooperate with [insert your superpower here]? Are you insan=
e?"
No, I'm a parent. And I'd like to build a world for the kids that is less r=
isky.=20
We traded grain with the Soviet Union during the Cold War! We built arms co=
ntrol treaties with people we were convinced wanted to destroy us. We creat=
ed the International Space Station with the Russians after decades of space=
 race competition. Somehow, when survival is on the line, humans figure out=
 how to cooperate just enough to avoid extinction.
This isn't about singing Kumbaya. It's about being smart rivals instead of =
stupid ones. My brother and I compete on everything=E2=80=94from board game=
s to sports to barbecue. But if his house caught fire, I'd be there with a =
hose. That's smart rivalry.
If We Pop Back to 1776 for a Second=E2=80=A6
The founders who signed the Declaration 249 years ago were practical. They =
traded with enemies, made alliances with monarchs they despised, and built =
a system assuming everyone would try to accumulate power. The documents fra=
med are mostly exhaustive compromise products with a little vision hanging =
the thing together (death by committee in Philadelphia).=20
We need some of that spirit with AI. Idealism about the future we want=E2=
=80=94a world where AI serves human flourishing. Realism about how we get t=
here=E2=80=94through verified cooperation on narrow technical issues while =
competing everywhere else.
The real race isn't between American AI and Chinese AI. It's between contro=
lled AI and uncontrolled AI. Between AI that serves humans and AI that serv=
es itself. Between a future where our grandchildren thank us for being wise=
 and one where they look at us and ask why in that sort of voice that makes=
 you want to flinch.
Whether we admit it or not, we're all in this together. Intelligence is gro=
wing by leaps and bounds and proliferating faster than any government can m=
anage. That=E2=80=99s why this is a conversation for every single one of us=
=2E We all have a seat at the table.
To stretch a metaphor a bit, humanity=E2=80=99s baby=E2=80=94AI=E2=80=94is =
growing up terrifyingly fast. We can raise it right, or we can let our riva=
lries create a monster.=20
I know which future I want. And I=E2=80=99m glad we live in a world where A=
I belongs to everyone by virtue of the internet itself. Happy 4th, and may =
those ChatGPT recipes work well for you!
