This is a special post, because it=E2=80=99s not just sharing product princ=
iples in an abstract way. I tear down a bit of what went wrong with one of =
the most high-profile AI product launch fails in the last year (sorry, Klar=
na).=20
And that=E2=80=99s not all=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99m also going to share with you=
 how I=E2=80=99m using and applying these principles with a new project I=
=E2=80=99m revealing for the first time here: PromptKit [ https://substack.=

dzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. PromptKit is my answer to wha=
t I see as one of the biggest gaps in AI today: the lack of high quality pr=
ompting tools. We put more and more pressure on our prompts (heck, multi-hu=
ndred million dollar startups are built on system prompts these days), and =
yet we don=E2=80=99t really have a systematic way to test, evaluate, and ta=
ke care of these prompts like the first class citizens they are.
I=E2=80=99d like to change that, and that=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m working=
 on PromptKit.
I=E2=80=99ll explain below a bit more about the Klarna story, what this tel=
ls us about the AI product principles that shape successful launches, and I=
=E2=80=99ll eat my own dogfood by applying all that to PromptKit at the end=
 of the post. Enjoy!
Subscribers get all these posts!

 the award podium. (Are there awards for terrible AI backtracking? There sh=

Last year the Swedish fintech boasted that its ChatGPT-style bot had replac=

Then nothing, for months.
Then in 2025, the same CEO conceded the experiment back-fired [ https://sub=

the bot, again for the humans it tried to erase.
Klarna isn=E2=80=99t an outlier; it=E2=80=99s a waypoint on a longer map of=
 busted AI economics. An IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs [ https://substack.com/re=

The common failure mode isn=E2=80=99t bad models or slow chips; it=E2=80=99=
s a product-discipline gap. Large language models are probabilistic engines=
 dressed in human-grade service promises. Every hallucination, every contex=

collapses the moment users bail=E2=80=94or, worse, linger just long enough =
to file support tickets about the support bot.
So this essay won=E2=80=99t obsess over transformer diagrams or token price=

escue may be your own.
Principle 1=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82Trust Loops Outweigh Head-Count Math
Klarna=E2=80=99s gamble is a perfect reminder that cost savings vanish the =
instant trust breaks. After a year of boasting that its chatbot could handl=
e the load of 700 human agents, the company is now recruiting live staff ag=
ain because customers judged the bot=E2=80=99s answers =E2=80=9Clower quali=
ty.=E2=80=9D Executives loved the margin story; users felt abandoned. The g=
ap between those two feelings is alarmingly common with fast-tracked AI pro=
jects.
Traditional software earns one big down-payment of trust: install it, watch=
 it behave, move on. Large language models are different=E2=80=94they speak=
 in probabilities, not guarantees=E2=80=94so every single interaction can r=
eset the credibility meter. That makes live, visible trust loops the first =
design requirement, not a polishing pass you add after launch. A trustworth=
y AI surface does four things relentlessly:
Shows its work. Citations, retrieval breadcrumbs, or at minimum a peek at t=
he sources used.
Escalates without friction. Ideally, one click to a human ticket of some so=
rt, with full context handed off.
Allows instant rollback. Version history and =E2=80=9Cundo=E2=80=9D as prom=
inent as the =E2=80=9Csend=E2=80=9D button.
Measures regret. Every correction, escalation, or abandoned session feeds b=
ack into fine-tuning and KPI dashboards the product team actually reviews.
Skip any link in that loop and you trade short-term payroll relief for long=
-term churn, support double-handling, and reputational drag=E2=80=94the ver=

=80=99t a milestone; it=E2=80=99s a heartbeat you have to keep nudging with=
 a pacemaker.
Principle 2=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82State Is the New UX
Customer support isn=E2=80=99t a trivia quiz; it=E2=80=99s a long-running d=
ialogue anchored in order numbers, refund IDs, and the emotional residue of=
 yesterday=E2=80=99s dispute. Humans keep that multi-threaded state in work=
ing memory. Klarna=E2=80=99s chatbot didn=E2=80=99t=E2=80=94which is why CE=
O Sebastian Siemiatkowski now concedes the system produced =E2=80=9Clower q=
uality=E2=80=9D answers that felt like the work of =E2=80=9C700 really bad =
agents.=E2=80=9D
Large language models arrive stateless. Without an explicit memory architec=
ture=E2=80=94vector stores for past tickets, graph links to payment status,=
 stable embeddings for a customer=E2=80=99s tone preferences=E2=80=94the bo=
t greets every user like a polite amnesiac. Fluency masks the problem for a=
 minute or two, but the first missing breadcrumb forces an escalation and s=
hatters trust. That=E2=80=99s exactly what happened at Klarna: two-thirds o=
f chats looked automated on the KPI dashboard, yet an invisible tail of unr=
esolved edge-cases ballooned until the company had to rehire people just to=
 close the loops the AI reopened.
Designing for state means treating memory as front-of-house, not a back-off=
ice afterthought. A resilient AI surface:
Persists context across sessions. The bot should pick up today=E2=80=99s co=
nversation with yesterday=E2=80=99s ticket already loaded.
Stores structured facts and fuzzy sentiment. Order totals live next to =E2=
=80=9Ccustomer sounded frustrated last call.=E2=80=9D
Surfaces the thread visibly. Users can scroll the conversation timeline and=
 watch the AI reference prior steps=E2=80=94just like a seasoned human rep =
flipping through notes.
Every byte you remember cuts friction on the next interaction; every byte y=
ou forget re-creates it. In a probabilistic world, continuity is what turns=
 an impressive demo into a product people will use twice.
Principle 3 =E2=80=94 The Emotional Moat
Speed, accuracy, even price can be matched=E2=80=94but the way a product ma=
kes people feel is stubbornly hard to copy. Klarna=E2=80=99s retreat proves=
 the point. Customers could check delivery dates faster than ever, yet some=
thing essential was missing: the sense of being heard. Within months of tou=
ting a chatbot that handled the workload of 700 agents, Klarna began rehiri=
ng humans so shoppers could =E2=80=9Calways have the option to speak with a=
 person.=E2=80=9D
Why did the math flip so quickly? An AI that resolves tickets in 45 seconds=
 but leaves a faint aftertaste of indifference erodes brand equity at compo=
und interest. The IBM survey that found only one-quarter of AI projects del=
iver their promised ROI hints at the hidden line item: emotional churn. Eve=
ry percentage point of customer defection drags lifetime value far more tha=
n a payroll reduction can offset.
Designing for an emotional moat means treating affect as a first-class requ=
irement:
Respectful tone, every reply. Polite fluency is table-stakes; users must se=
nse genuine empathy.
Visible agency. Let people steer the conversation=E2=80=94ask clarifying qu=
estions, choose formality, throttle creativity.
Humility by default. Frame outputs as suggestions, not decrees; show uncert=
ainty when it exists.
Get this right and competitors can clone your model weights but not the tru=
st that keeps users coming back. Miss it, and the fastest AI in the world f=
eels like a self-checkout kiosk that barks orders=E2=80=94convenient until =
it isn=E2=80=99t, memorable for the wrong reason, and easily skipped for a =
store that still says =E2=80=9Cthanks.=E2=80=9D
Principle 4 =E2=80=94 Deterministic Recovery for a Probabilistic Engine
Software used to be a light switch: either it executed the code path you wr=
ote or it threw an exception you could trace. Large-language-model products=
 are different animals=E2=80=94probabilistic, improvisational, and therefor=
e capable of drifting off course in ways no unit test will ever catch. Klar=
na learned this the hard way. If its chatbot made a mistake, there was no s=
afe, obvious way for the customer=E2=80=94or the frontline supervisor=E2=80=
=94to roll back. And human backup didn=E2=80=99t receive enough ticket cont=
ext in practice to be helpful.
A resilient AI product treats error recovery the way aviation treats engine=
 flame-outs: assume it happens, make recovery muscle-memory. That means bui=
lding deterministic controls around the model=E2=80=99s stochastic core:
Instant, global Undo. Ideally every AI action=E2=80=94edit, refund, code pa=
tch=E2=80=94must be reversible with a single click. No scavenger hunt throu=
gh hidden menus.
Side-by-side diffs. Show users exactly what changed: before, after, and the=
 model=E2=80=99s confidence. Visibility drains panic.
Sandbox mode by default. Let users preview consequences (the SQL, the custo=
mer email, the invoice) before committing them to prod.
Full audit trail. Log inputs, outputs, and user interventions. When somethi=
ng goes off the rails you need a black-box recorder, not a whodunit.
Human-in-the-loop takeover that preserves state. Escalation is pointless if=
 the agent has to start from scratch. Pass the whole conversation, preferab=
ly embeddings included.
None of this is really =E2=80=9Cnice to have.=E2=80=9D Missing on these poi=
nts is how you become another grim statistic in the rapidly growing graveya=
rd of AI fails. Deterministic recovery is how you erase those hidden costs =
before they metastasize.
Think of it as the seat-belt rule for AI. Users won=E2=80=99t notice it whe=
n everything goes right, but the first time the model veers off the road, t=
hat seat-belt is the difference between a startled laugh and a months-long =
post-mortem. Build it in from day one, and the inevitable model mistakes be=
come speed bumps instead of headlines.
Principle 5 =E2=80=94 Show the Invisible Delta
Accountants love a clean =C2=ADbefore-and-after P&L: cut 700 salaries, drop=
 a tidy line of operating expense, and call it AI-driven efficiency. Klarna=
=E2=80=99s balance-sheet math looked just that simple=E2=80=94until custome=
r-satisfaction scores slid, ticket escalations spiked, and the company had =
to hire humans back at premium urgency rates. The savings were visible; the=
 cost of eroded trust and extra re-work was hidden.
Klarna is hardly alone. A fresh BCG survey of 1,800 C-suite leaders [ https=
://substack.com/redirect/b9b60a2e-f7c2-43f4-952e-cd496d90be86?j=3DeyJ1IjoiN=
WtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] across 20 countrie=
s found that while 75% of executives rank AI among their top three prioriti=
es, only 25% report =E2=80=9Csignificant value=E2=80=9D so far. Their blunt=
 question for 2025, according to BCG=E2=80=99s tech chief Sylvain Duranton,=
 is: =E2=80=9CWhere=E2=80=99s my money?=E2=80=9D The ROI is there, but much=
 of it lies in shaved cognitive load=E2=80=94fewer mental context switches,=
 faster document triage, subtler risk flags=E2=80=94benefits that never app=
ear in a payroll spreadsheet unless the product surfaces the delta in real =
time.
A durable AI surface therefore instrumentalizes its own impact:
*=E2=80=83Time saved. =E2=80=9CThis reply took 38 seconds instead of 4 minu=
tes.=E2=80=9D
*=E2=80=83Errors prevented. =E2=80=9CFlagged 2 duplicate refunds before the=
y posted.=E2=80=9D
*=E2=80=83Revenue protected. =E2=80=9CRecovered 6 at-risk subscribers this =
week.=E2=80=9D
These metrics belong in the UI, not just the quarterly slide deck. When use=
rs=E2=80=94and CFOs=E2=80=94see the scoreboard tick upward session by sessi=
on, they internalize the value and forgive the occasional probabilistic hic=
cup. Fail to expose the lift and the tool becomes the first expense line qu=
estioned when budgets tighten.
In short, if the product can=E2=80=99t prove its own worth at the point of =
use, it hasn=E2=80=99t earned the second use. Make the wins impossible to m=
iss, and the ROI debate evaporates before the finance meeting even begins.
Principle 6 =E2=80=94 The Second-Use Litmus, Not Launch-Day Fireworks
Klarna=E2=80=99s chatbot dazzled on day one: 2.3 million conversations in i=
ts first month, coverage in Fortune, and a triumphant claim that it had tak=
en over 75 percent of all customer chats=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cthe work of 700 a=
gents.=E2=80=9D Yet within a year the firm was rehiring people because repe=
at users were bailing. That trajectory is the perfect caution sign for AI b=
uilders: the metric that matters isn=E2=80=99t the spike on launch day=E2=
=80=94it=E2=80=99s who comes back after the novelty wears off.
Why the fall-off? First-use curiosity is cheap; second-use loyalty is expen=
sive. By session two the user knows the trick, so the bar shifts from =E2=
=80=9CCan it do something cool?=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9CWill it remove real fr=
iction every time I need it?=E2=80=9D Klarna=E2=80=99s bot could greet cust=
omers in 35 languages, but in practice it punted edge-cases to humans witho=
ut context, forcing shoppers to explain themselves twice and turning a =E2=
=80=98wow=E2=80=99 into a =E2=80=98why bother=E2=80=99.
A product that clears the Second-Use Litmus does three things relentlessly:
Delivers a 10=C3=97 job improvement, not a 10-second magic show. If you can=
=E2=80=99t name the exact steps you=E2=80=99ve amputated from the user=E2=
=80=99s weekly workflow, you haven=E2=80=99t earned tomorrow=E2=80=99s sess=
ion.
Proves reliability before it asks for dependence. Recovery, audit trails, a=
nd trust loops (Principles 1 & 4) make the difference between a neat demo a=
nd a habitual tool.
Measures retention in cohorts, not anecdotes. Keep your eye on Day-2, Week-=
2, and Month-1 return rates; that curve is the canary for hidden quality ga=
ps.
The IBM study that showed only 16 percent of AI initiatives ever reach scal=
e is really a story of second-use failure: most pilots look fine at first t=
ouch, then stall when broader teams discover the rough edges prototypes hid=
=2E
Bottom line: If your AI feature vanished tomorrow and no user would scream,=
 you built a press release, not a product. The surest path past the Demo Cl=
iff is to design for the moment =E2=80=93 usually a Tuesday at 4 p.m. =E2=
=80=93 when a real customer needs real help again and chooses your tool bec=
ause it=E2=80=99s now indispensable, not merely impressive.
So that=E2=80=99s my take on what it really takes to build right in the age=
 of AI. And these principles are really hard to build with, as you=E2=80=99=
re about to see! It=E2=80=99s not easy mode out here.
And now it=E2=80=99s time to tell you a bit more about what I=E2=80=99m bui=
lding, how I=E2=80=99m putting my money where my mouth is=E2=80=94really ex=

o serious AI prompters.
I think it=E2=80=99s ready to tell you about, and to ask your feedback on.
1. Trust Loops
Clarity: guard-railed prompt builder + instant local tests.
Still cooking: automatic drift ledger and =E2=80=9Cheads-up=E2=80=9D alerts=
=2E
2. State Is the New UX
Clarity: basic version history and a rollback button.
Still cooking: side-by-side diffs and A/B branches.
3. Emotional Moat
Clarity: all tests run in your browser with your API key=E2=80=94so zero da=
ta leaves the page.
Still cooking: encrypted cloud sync (only if local-first proves solid).
4. Deterministic Recovery
Clarity: one-click rollback.
Still cooking: auto-revert staging lane + canary deploys.
5. Show the Delta
Clarity: nothing yet=E2=80=94right now I eyeball a Notion checklist.
Still cooking: inline reliability and =E2=80=9Cmoney-saved=E2=80=9D metrics=
=20
6. Second-Use Litmus
Clarity: dog-fooding and optimizing for early users
Still cooking: looking to target 1k users expressing interest
