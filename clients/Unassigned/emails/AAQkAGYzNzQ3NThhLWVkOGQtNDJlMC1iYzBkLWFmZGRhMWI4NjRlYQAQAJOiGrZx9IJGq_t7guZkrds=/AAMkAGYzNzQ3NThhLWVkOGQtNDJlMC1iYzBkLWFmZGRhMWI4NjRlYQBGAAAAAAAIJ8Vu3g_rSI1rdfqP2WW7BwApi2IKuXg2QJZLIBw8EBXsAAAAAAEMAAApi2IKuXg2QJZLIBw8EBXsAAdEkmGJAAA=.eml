Hey Income Aficionados,

Each week, I join the rest of the Option Pit team for the TICKER
HIGHLIGHT SHOW [https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/25538413b4c045d6b090ebbf=
c21ba027-964b7f2db91d4e82abc4e0972ca9972d/57] =E2=80=93 a completely free
session where we break down our top and bottom stock picks of the
week.

Then we build a SIMPLE, DIRECTIONAL OPTIONS TRADE you can use right
away =E2=80=93 again, totally free.

Before this week=E2=80=99s show, I want to give you a sneak peek: the stock
I=E2=80=99m loving right now=E2=80=A6 and the one I think is in trouble.

MY BULLISH PICK: PLTR

While the world obsesses over GPUs and large language models, PALANTIR
TECHNOLOGIES INC (TICKER: PLTR) is quietly positioning itself as the
GO-TO OPERATING SYSTEM FOR COMPANIES TRYING TO MAKE AI ACTUALLY WORK.
And that=E2=80=99s the part most businesses still haven=E2=80=99t figured
out=E2=80=94_how to turn AI hype into real productivity and profit.=C2=A0 _=
Many
don=E2=80=99t even know it yet, but CEOs across the world are about to get
AI Inference fever!

This is the phase of AI that I think is JUST beginning, and that=E2=80=99s
where Palantir shines.

Their platform isn=E2=80=99t just flashy dashboards. It=E2=80=99s a
FULLY-INTEGRATED AI DECISION LAYER that sits on top of messy,
real-world data=E2=80=94exactly the kind of setup traditional businesses
need but don=E2=80=99t have the time, skill, or staff to build themselves.
In fact, things are moving so quickly that they don=E2=80=99t even know
where to start. Palantir knows.

And once one major competitor in an industry starts showing efficiency
gains or faster decision-making using Palantir=E2=80=99s tools, the "AI
FEVER" BEGINS. CEOs pick up the phone. Boards ask: _=E2=80=9CWhy aren=E2=80=
=99t we
doing this yet?=E2=80=9D_ And just like that, PALANTIR=E2=80=99S PHONE IS R=
INGING
OFF THE HOOK.

Importantly, Palantir already KNOWS HOW TO OPERATE IN COMPLEX,
REGULATED ENVIRONMENTS. That=E2=80=99s a massive advantage when selling into
industries that can=E2=80=99t afford AI hallucinations or compliance
missteps. I don=E2=80=99t think AI is perfect yet, but in a year or two?

As AI adoption spreads beyond early adopters, Palantir is set to SCALE
INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF ENTERPRISE DEMAND. Think of it as the plumbing
and infrastructure for the AI revolution=E2=80=94and it's already built,
tested, and in production.

Investors looking beyond the hype cycle should ask not _who builds the
models_, but _who makes them usable_.

That answer, increasingly, is Palantir.

MY BEARISH PICK: DUOL

Once again this week I am targeting names that I think are having
their lawns mowed by cheap and plentiful AI.

DUOLINGO INC (TICKER: DUOL) is amazing. It helped revolutionize
language learning with gamified lessons, streaks, and bite-sized
practice. But the very technology it once embraced=E2=80=94AI=E2=80=94is now
threatening to make it obsolete.

Here=E2=80=99s the problem: AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and
others are rapidly becoming REAL-TIME, PERSONALIZED LANGUAGE TUTORS.
They can simulate conversation, correct grammar, adapt to user
mistakes, and offer cultural context far beyond Duolingo=E2=80=99s static
lesson trees. Instead of following a rigid path, learners can now
CONVERSE NATURALLY with AI in any language, anytime.

Even worse for Duolingo, these AI tutors are either FREE OR BUNDLED
into platforms users already use daily=E2=80=94smartphones, browsers, or
voice assistants.

While Duolingo has tried to integrate AI into its premium features,
it=E2=80=99s fundamentally built around GAMIFIED REPETITION, NOT DYNAMIC
CONVERSATION. That model may not survive in a world where users want
fluent back-and-forth speaking, not digital flashcards.

As AI becomes ubiquitous in education and productivity tools, Duolingo
risks becoming the BLACKBERRY OF LANGUAGE LEARNING=E2=80=94once innovative,
now left behind by a wave of smarter, faster, more flexible
technology.

Unless Duolingo reinvents itself fast, the AI revolution might speak
its final lesson=E2=80=94IN EVERY LANGUAGE BUT DUOLINGO=E2=80=99S.

Will one of my AI picks become our free trade on Monday? Be there to
