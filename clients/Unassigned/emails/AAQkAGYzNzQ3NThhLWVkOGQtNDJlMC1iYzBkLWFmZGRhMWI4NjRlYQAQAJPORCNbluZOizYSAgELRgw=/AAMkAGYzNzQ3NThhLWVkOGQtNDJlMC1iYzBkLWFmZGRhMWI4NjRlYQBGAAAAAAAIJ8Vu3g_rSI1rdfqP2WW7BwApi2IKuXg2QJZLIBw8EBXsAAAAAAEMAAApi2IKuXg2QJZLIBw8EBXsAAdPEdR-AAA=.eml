We=E2=80=99ll start by exploring exactly what analytical thinking interview=
s assess and how they=E2=80=99re structured. By understanding the interview=
er=E2=80=99s perspective, you=E2=80=99ll be better equipped to provide the =
signals they=E2=80=99re looking for.
Understand the analytical thinking interview
Analytical thinking (AT) interviews assess a candidate=E2=80=99s ability to=
 understand a product in the context of its broader company and its market,=
 establish metrics to track success, identify team goals, and evaluate trad=
eoffs in a structured way. Here are some examples of typical AT questions:
=E2=80=9CHow would you measure success for Spotify?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re a PM at Meta. Set a goal for Instagram Reels.=E2=80=
=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat should be the North Star metric for DoorDash?=E2=80=9D
Although an AT interview normally lasts 45 minutes, you=E2=80=99ll have onl=
y about 35 minutes of actual working time after accounting for introduction=
s and wrap-up questions. That might seem like plenty of time, but it flies =
by, so you=E2=80=99ll want to let your inner =E2=80=9Ctime cop=E2=80=9D run=
 the show.
Since the interviewer won=E2=80=99t be looking for a =E2=80=9Ccorrect=E2=80=
=9D answer=E2=80=94rather, they=E2=80=99re evaluating your thought process=
=E2=80=94I recommend approaching the interview with this linear flow to max=
imize your chances of providing strong signals for the following dimensions=
 in a structured way:
Note: Analytical thinking interviews can sometimes include other question t=
ypes, such as debugging/root cause analysis questions and estimation questi=
ons, but these are becoming less common. I included some thoughts about tac=
kling debugging and estimation questions at the bottom of this post.
Step 1: Assumptions and game plan
The opening minutes of an analytical thinking interview can make or break y=
our performance. I=E2=80=99ve watched countless candidates struggle because=
 they jumped straight into goals without aligning with the interviewer on t=
he structure.
My advice is to approach the interview as a game with clear rules rather th=
an a casual conversation, and spend the first minute making a handful of as=
sumptions at the start of the interview that narrow the scope to a manageab=
le exercise without prematurely limiting the solution space. Then outline y=
our game plan for the interview, showing the interviewer how you want to sp=
end your time together.
When transitioning between key sections of the interview structure (e.g. fr=
om product rationale to metrics framework), take a pause to think through y=
our content for that section of the interview. Once you=E2=80=99re ready, c=
heck in with the interviewer to walk them through your thinking and confirm=
 they=E2=80=99re following before you proceed to the next section.
To set yourself up for success, state a few potential assumptions to align =
on the scope of the exercise. Here are some flavors of assumptions that can=
 be helpful:
Let=E2=80=99s now apply our assumptions framework to the first typical AT q=
uestion I gave above, which we=E2=80=99ll be using as an example throughout=
 this post: How would you measure success for Spotify? (Other potential que=
stions and answers will be available in links at the bottom of each section=
=2E)
The assumptions below focus on the core consumer-facing music streaming ser=
vice globally across all platforms, preventing getting lost in niche featur=
es or regional specifics. This grants you the freedom to explore meaningful=
 metrics that capture Spotify=E2=80=99s fundamental purpose without being o=
verwhelmed:
I=E2=80=99ll focus on Spotify=E2=80=99s core music streaming service as the=
 primary product.
I=E2=80=99ll emphasize the consumer-facing experience rather than artist/la=
bel tools or enterprise solutions.
I=E2=80=99ll assume we=E2=80=99re focusing on global metrics, not specific =
to any one region.
I=E2=80=99ll assume we=E2=80=99re talking about all platforms where Spotify=
 is available (mobile, desktop, etc.).
Additional examples:
Question: You=E2=80=99re a PM at Meta. Set a goal for Instagram Reels.
Assumptions here [ https://substack.com/redirect/7874a0eb-19fe-4f53-ac8e-4f=

Ow0 ] acknowledge Reels=E2=80=99s worldwide reach, concentrating on mobile =
because that=E2=80=99s where the primary user engagement happens.
We also choose to focus on the current state of the product to ensure align=
ment with the interviewer that we=E2=80=99re not measuring success at launc=
h.
Question: What should be the North Star metric for DoorDash?
Assumptions here [ https://substack.com/redirect/63234f2c-fae1-4579-bdee-af=
267e86ee06?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMP=
Ow0 ] mention customers, restaurants, and dashers up front, signaling that =
you think about the entire marketplace.=20
Focusing on the U.S. market prevents overwhelming complexity, and including=
 all platforms/devices keeps the exercise comprehensive.
After stating assumptions, share your game plan for the interview to make s=
ure you=E2=80=99re on the same page as the interviewer about how you=E2=80=
=99ll spend your time together:
=E2=80=9CI want to start by reviewing the product=E2=80=99s landscape and r=
eason for existing, then identify key stakeholders and ecosystem health met=
rics, define a North Star metric with guardrails, and finally set specific =
team goals. We can discuss tradeoffs along the way at any point. Does that =
sound like a good plan for our time together?=E2=80=9D
Interviewers love hearing this because it tells them you have a plan to gen=
erate the signals they need. To put you in the interviewer=E2=80=99s shoes,=
 this is kind of like sitting down to play a game with someone who knows ho=
w to play vs. someone who doesn=E2=80=99t. It=E2=80=99s just better.
Outlining your game plan up front also gives the interviewer a chance to re=
direct you if they want to spend the time differently, preventing you from =
going in the wrong direction and wasting everybody=E2=80=99s time.
Step 2: Product rationale
With the interviewer on board with your assumptions and game plan, the next=
 step is articulating the product rationale. This is your opportunity to es=
tablish your understanding of the product context and its strategic importa=
nce to the business before diving into metrics. Without this contextual gro=
unding, your metrics will feel arbitrary rather than aligned with the produ=
ct=E2=80=99s purpose and the business needs.
While most good candidates describe what a product does, you=E2=80=99ll set=
 yourself apart by building a compelling strategic foundation touching on t=
hree key areas:
Product context: Describe the product, its maturity level, and business mod=
el. Explain the core problem it solves for users and why this problem matte=
rs to the market and the company. Articulate how the product creates and ca=
ptures value, being specific about revenue streams.
Market positioning: Review the competitive landscape and highlight the comp=
any=E2=80=99s unique advantages relative to its peers. Let your awareness o=
f relevant trends in the market shine.
Company and product alignment: Create a concise, powerful mission statement=
 that captures the product=E2=80=99s core purpose. For products within a la=
rger company, establish a clear throughline from company mission to product=
 mission. Connect the product=E2=80=99s purpose to the parent company=E2=80=
=99s broader vision and strategic objectives.
Top candidates don=E2=80=99t just describe a product=E2=80=99s features but=
 establish a compelling case for why it matters to users, the business, and=
 the market. This foundation makes all subsequent metrics and recommendatio=
ns feel naturally aligned with the product=E2=80=99s core purpose.
=F0=9F=92=A1 Tip: Spend about a minute organizing your thoughts before shar=
ing product rationale with the interviewer.
Examples of articulating product rationale
Let=E2=80=99s now apply our metric framework principles to our question: Ho=
w would you measure success for Spotify?
The rationale below articulates the core problem Spotify solved (music pira=
cy and limited access), establishing why the product exists beyond its feat=
ures. Second, it positions Spotify within its competitive landscape, highli=
ghting specific differentiators like recommendations and platform support. =
Most importantly, it concludes with a powerful mission statement that will =
serve as our North Star for all subsequent metrics and decisions.
Spotify is a music and podcast streaming service offering millions of track=
s through a freemium model, generating revenue via premium subscriptions an=
d advertising to free users.
Spotify addressed the critical problem of music piracy by providing legal, =
affordable access to extensive content when consumers previously faced limi=
ted, expensive purchasing options or risky illegal downloads, creating a su=
stainable model benefiting both listeners and creators.
Currently in late growth/early maturity, Spotify has secured significant ma=
rket share while expanding globally and diversifying beyond music.
Competing with Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music, Spotify distin=
guishes itself through superior recommendations, social features, broader p=
latform support, and dedicated focus on audio content as its core business =
rather than an ancillary service to sell hardware or other subscriptions.
Mission statement: =E2=80=9CUnlock the potential of human creativity by giv=
ing artists the opportunity to live off their art and fans the ability to e=
njoy and be inspired by it.=E2=80=9D
Additional examples:
Question: You=E2=80=99re a PM at Meta. Set a goal for Instagram Reels.
The framework here [ https://substack.com/redirect/7874a0eb-19fe-4f53-ac8e-=

MPOw0 ] demonstrates how to craft a product rationale that connects product=
-level purpose to company-level strategy.=20
Note how it establishes the market context (shift to short-form video conte=
nt), competitive positioning against TikTok and YouTube Shorts, and Meta=E2=
=80=99s unique advantages.=20
It also explicitly connects Reels to Meta=E2=80=99s broader mission of buil=
ding human connection, creating a clear throughline from company vision to =
specific feature.
Question: What should be the North Star metric for DoorDash?
The framework here [ https://substack.com/redirect/63234f2c-fae1-4579-bdee-=
af267e86ee06?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMR=
MPOw0 ] demonstrates how to address multiple stakeholders in a marketplace.
Notice how it explicitly identifies the problem solved for each ecosystem p=
layer: convenience for customers, expanded reach for restaurants, and flexi=
ble earnings for drivers.
It also acknowledges the product=E2=80=99s maturity stage and expansion opp=
ortunities beyond its core offering.
The mission statement elegantly captures the multi-sided value proposition =
in a single sentence.
How to practice product rationale
Get reps in with an exercise that develops both written and verbal muscles:
Write down the rationale for 3 of your favorite products (touching on the k=
ey elements above), and grab time with a friend to verbally walk them throu=
gh these in roughly 2 minutes.
Then ask them to read back to you what they remember about why the product =
exists, who it=E2=80=99s for, how it makes money, and what makes it differe=
nt from its competitors. If they understood those, you=E2=80=99re on track!
Step 3: Metric framework
Next, you=E2=80=99ll leverage the product rationale to define concrete metr=
ics that track ecosystem health. This section is nuanced and often entails =
a decent amount of back-and-forth with the interviewer to make sure they fo=
llow your thinking. So allocate the largest chunk of time in the interview =
to your metric framework.
While good candidates can identify relevant metrics, what will set you apar=
t is a cohesive story about healthy growth:
Ecosystem value: Start by listing key players who derive value from the pro=
duct ecosystem rather than jumping straight to metrics. For each ecosystem =
player, identify their value proposition for participating (=E2=80=9CWhat=
=E2=80=99s in it for me?=E2=80=9D) and the specific actions they must take =
to realize this value. Leave out nice-to-have actions.
Metric definition: Track key actions through metrics that a data scientist =
could implement, including time frames based on real user behavior. Define =
a North Star metric (NSM) that reflects value creation across ecosystem pla=
yers and can grow indefinitely as the product succeeds. Make sure you inclu=
de a time frame (e.g. =E2=80=9Cweekly=E2=80=9D) with the NSM definition.
Critique NSM: Call out the drawbacks of your NSM, identifying 1-2 ways that=
 NSM growth could unintentionally damage ecosystem health. Define guardrail=
 metrics that specifically address the key drawbacks.
If you can=E2=80=99t describe your metric to a data scientist in a way that=
 they could run a query with, it=E2=80=99s not a useful metric. Always defi=
ne metrics so specifically that someone could implement them tomorrow, and =
focus on 3-5 primary metrics per ecosystem player rather than trying to cap=
ture everything. Metric selection can also become problematic if you use av=
erages or ratios as North Star metrics. Here=E2=80=99s why this backfires: =
if your NSM increases while your ecosystem actually shrinks, you=E2=80=99re=
 getting a false positive. I=E2=80=99ve watched candidates confidently pres=
ent metrics that could look great even as their product dies (not exactly w=
hat you want to signal to an interviewer).
=F0=9F=92=A1 Tip: Spend about 2 minutes organizing your thoughts before sha=
ring your metric framework with the interviewer.
Examples of metric frameworks
Let=E2=80=99s now apply our metric framework principles to our question: Ho=
w would you measure success for Spotify?
The framework below organizes metrics by players (listeners, creators, adve=
rtisers, Spotify), tracking value creation across the ecosystem. I like tra=
cking daily, weekly, and monthly (=E2=80=9CDWM=E2=80=9D in short) in the ec=
osystem metrics section before narrowing in on one time frame for the NSM. =
The NSM, =E2=80=9Ctotal streaming hours per week,=E2=80=9D measures the tot=
al volume of our unifying action that benefits all ecosystem players in a w=
ay that matches real engagement patterns. The guardrail metric prevents bec=
oming a passive platform.
Additional examples:
Question: You=E2=80=99re a PM at Meta. Set a goal for Instagram Reels.
The framework here [ https://substack.com/redirect/7874a0eb-19fe-4f53-ac8e-=
4fc2f21c3f33?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMR=
MPOw0 ] balances adoption indicators (daily Reels viewers) with engagement =
depth (watch time).
The North Star metric =E2=80=9Ctotal Reels watch time per week=E2=80=9D cap=
tures the core value: engaging short-form video.
Guardrail metrics prevent optimizing watch time at the expense of content q=
uality or broad user adoption.
Question: What should be the North Star metric for DoorDash?
The framework here [ https://substack.com/redirect/63234f2c-fae1-4579-bdee-=
af267e86ee06?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMR=
MPOw0 ] measures marketplace success by tracking key indicators for all pla=
yers: customers placing orders, restaurants fulfilling them, and dashers de=
livering.
The North Star metric, =E2=80=9Ctotal completed deliveries per week,=E2=80=
=9D captures the core transaction creating value across all sides.
Guardrail metrics prevent pitfalls of pursuing delivery volume alone: order=
 satisfaction for quality, retention rates for sustainability, and profit m=
argins to avoid unprofitable growth.
How to practice metrics frameworks
With the products you chose earlier, spend about 10 minutes doing the follo=
wing exercise with each:
Identify the ecosystem players, map out what value they get and what action=
s they take, and create specific metrics with time frames that actually mak=
e sense.
Then define a North Star metric that can grow indefinitely, and pair it wit=
h guardrail metrics that address the biggest ways your NSM could mislead yo=
u.
To build your verbal communication muscle, walk a friend or two through you=
r thinking. Ask them if they understand who benefits from the product, how =
success would be measured, and why you chose your specific North Star metri=
c over alternatives. If they can clearly explain back your measurement logi=
c and see the connection between value and metrics, you=E2=80=99re in good =
shape!
Step 4: Goal-setting
After you=E2=80=99ve nailed down a solid metrics framework, here comes the =
critical transition that trips up a lot of candidates: making an =E2=80=9Ca=
ltitude shift=E2=80=9D from company/product-level metrics to specific team-=
level goals. This is where you show the interviewer you can bridge strategy=
 and execution=E2=80=94a skill they=E2=80=99re evaluating...

interviews assess a candidate=E2=80=99s ability to understand a product in =

 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The op=
ening minutes of an analytical thinking interview can make or break your pe=
rformance. I=E2=80=99ve watched countless candidates struggle because they =
jumped straight into goals without aligning with the interviewer on the str=
ucture.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">My advice is to approach the interview as a game wi=
th clear rules rather than a casual conversation, and spend the first minut=
e making a handful of assumptions at the start of the interview that narrow=
 the scope to a manageable exercise without prematurely limiting the soluti=
on space. Then outline your game plan for the interview, showing the interv=
iewer how you want to spend your time together.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When transi=
tioning between key sections of the interview structure (e.g. from product =
rationale to metrics framework), take a pause to think through your content=
 for that section of the interview. Once you=E2=80=99re ready, check in wit=
h the interviewer to walk them through your thinking and confirm they=E2=80=
=99re following before you proceed to the next section.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">To =
set yourself up for success, state a few potential assumptions to align on =
the scope of the exercise. Here are some flavors of assumptions that can be=
 helpful:</p><div class=3D"captioned-image-container-static" style=3D"font-=

you use averages or ratios as North Star metrics. Here=E2=80=99s why this b=
ackfires: if your NSM increases while your ecosystem actually shrinks, you=
=E2=80=99re getting a false positive. I=E2=80=99ve watched candidates confi=
