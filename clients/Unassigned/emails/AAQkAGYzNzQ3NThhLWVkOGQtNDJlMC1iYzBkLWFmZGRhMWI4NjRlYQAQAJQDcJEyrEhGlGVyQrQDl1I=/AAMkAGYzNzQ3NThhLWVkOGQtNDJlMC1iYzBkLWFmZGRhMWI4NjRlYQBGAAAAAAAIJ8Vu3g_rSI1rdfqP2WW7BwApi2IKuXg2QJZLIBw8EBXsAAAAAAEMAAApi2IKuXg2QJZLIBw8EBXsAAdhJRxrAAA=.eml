d-by-ai-nail-these-3-concepts

For this week=E2=80=99s free post, I wanted to focus on three of the most m=
isunderstood concepts I see when I talk about AI: tokenization, jagged inte=
lligence, and the idea that big prompts are always better.
I picked these three because I find that when I go from eyes-glazed to =E2=
=80=9Coh!=E2=80=9D with these three, people often unlock a lot of the rest =
of AI on their own. Think about it: if you understand how AI processes data=
, where it=E2=80=99s good at handling that data, and how to communicate int=
ent=E2=80=94well that=E2=80=99s the big picture isn=E2=80=99t it?=20
A lot of the rest of the AI concepts can fall into place once you get those=
 bit puzzle pieces down. It=E2=80=99s like when I=E2=80=99d do 2000 word pu=
zzles with the family on vacation as a kid and we=E2=80=99d always start wi=
th the corner pieces. These are the corner puzzle pieces of AI.

Three AI Concepts That Will Change How You Work (And Why They're So Confusi=
ng)
Let=E2=80=99s get right to it! What are these three concepts, and why do th=
ey matter?=20
1. What Is Tokenizable Data?
I talk about tokenizable distributions, and I can see people's eyes glaze o=
ver. What does tokenize mean? Very simply, ask yourself if a piece of data =
could appear in a document. If it could, that's a good sign it's probably t=
okenizable. If you can't imagine it fitting in a document, it's probably no=
t tokenizable. (Nvidia has a great token explanation here [ https://substac=
k.com/redirect/091b6acd-3004-4fab-b7fb-fc2056f79876?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0=
=2Ezdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].)
When you ask if AI can do something, people usually think about the task as=
 a whole. But I always start with the data and tokens first. Can I even fit=
 it in? Can the tokens go into the system? Then we get to subsequent questi=
ons: Is there too much data? Is it too big for the context window? Is the t=
ask too multifaceted for a single prompt? Or is it too complex for AI to ha=
ndle with nuance? AI often polishes off the nuance in a task.
Understanding whether AI can do something starts with the token=E2=80=94jus=
t a little chunk that passes into the transformer. It's a piece of a word, =
about four characters. As an example of something that doesn't easily token=
ize: spreadsheets. You need special techniques for spreadsheets. Very rough=
ly, AI is still 10x farther behind on spreadsheets than Word docs. Is it ge=
tting better? Absolutely. But it's not where Word doc processing is.
You can hand a very large Word document to AI and get a sense of what's in =
there. Try the same with a large spreadsheet=E2=80=94because you value accu=
racy in numbers=E2=80=94and you won't get nearly as lucky unless you have a=
 specialized tool. That's why tools like DataRails [ https://substack.com/r=
edirect/068adb99-41c9-4f85-9fde-f3792cf94367?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88=
YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] exist. Tokenized data exists in tie=
rs:
Tier A: Easily tokenized data. Anything in your Wiki is super easily tokeni=
zed.
Tier B: Spreadsheet-scale data. It fits in a spreadsheet. Not super easy to=
 tokenize, but you can probably massage it and get it in there.
Tier C: Data lake data. Available for search, potentially through agentic s=
earch. But it's too big=E2=80=94hundreds of thousands and millions of rows =
of time series data that you have to preserve structural relationships for =
before you can develop insights via LLM. Traditional LLM transformer archit=
ectures don't handle that well.
You can take small pieces and learn something through tokenization. But whe=
n people talk about hooking up LLMs to large data sources, what they're rea=
lly saying is they've figured out how to search the data lake to retrieve u=
seful information that they can build into insights. There are preparatory =
steps to do that well, but that=E2=80=99s out of scope of this article (you=
 might check out the hybrid search section in my RAG guide [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/3e2d6f52-1f92-45a8-b1bd-a00af75112ce?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In=
0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] for that).
Think of tokenizable data as stuff you can fit in a Word doc first. Second,=
 maybe it can go in Excel. Third, anything so big and complex that it needs=
 a data warehouse or data lake will be much harder. What's interesting: the=
 easier it is to tokenize, the more you can shape your destiny with AI and =
that content. It's quite difficult to pivot and architect AI solutions over=
 data lakes. Organizations wrestle with this constantly, and this makes mov=
ing forward on AI harder for larger data problems (but of course you get le=
verage if you can do it successfully).
Successful AI pivots often start with something simpler=E2=80=94company pol=
icies in one neat Word doc, or three or four=E2=80=94you can easily get tha=
t into LLMs and immediately control your destiny.=20
Learn to think in terms of tokenizable data. Think whether it fits in a Wor=
d doc, maybe whether you can sketch it on a napkin, since a napkin test is =
a handy test for context window size. If you can draw the complexity on a n=
apkin, AI can be very helpful. If you can't fit the complexity onto the nap=
kin, it may be too complex for nuanced AI perspective. Keep in mind you can=
 fit everything from the Amazon Flywheel to the concept of transformer arch=
itecture in AI on a napkin, so you have more mileage than you think there.
Jagged Intelligence
Moving from tokenization: jagged intelligence. Again, people's eyes glaze o=
ver. Jagged intelligence simply means we have AIs that are in some ways as =
smart as Einstein and in other ways worse than the worst intern you've ever=
 met. I was a pretty bad intern myself.
The problem: AI is not a continuous intelligence surface. It has really lar=
ge gaps driven by known issues, particularly around memory. If AI can't rem=
ember something, it can't learn as it goes. Yes, LLM teams are working on t=
his, but it's a hard problem without much progress yet. For now, it's very =
difficult to get AI to consistently do certain simple things that require m=
emory.
For example, if you talk to AI about your role and ask it to write an excel=
lent article, proposal, or email, you have to re-explain what you want agai=
n and again. If you make any mistake re-explaining, your faithful AI will m=
ake a mistake. That's jagged intelligence. It's good enough to write those =
outputs really well but not good enough to remember how to do it or avoid b=
eing extremely sensitive to briefing mistakes.
Think of it as Shakespeare obsessed with following instructions. If you mak=
e any mistake in the instructions, Shakespeare makes mistakes. This is why =
prompting matters so much=E2=80=94you're trying to get the LLM to do what i=
t does best rather than getting stuck where it doesn't do well.
Organizations come up with all sorts of tricks for this (saving prompts, fi=
guring out RAG architectures for memory management, etc.) but ultimately th=
ey=E2=80=99re all trying to work around the fundamental limitation that you=
 have to re-explain stuff to the AI a LOT.
Other low points in jagged intelligence: math. LLMs will call other tools t=
o do math. There are specialized models=E2=80=94Gemini has one, OpenAI appa=
rently has one that does math Olympiad problems. But when it comes to "is 9=
=2E9 or 9.11 bigger," LLMs can still st=
ruggle. If you're trying to understand=
 mathematical modeling of concepts or weigh business levers, you get some i=
nsight from AI, but I find it tends to cluster around existing distribution=
s of strategic advice=E2=80=94think McKinsey deck-level abstraction. It doe=
sn't tend to be deeply insightful unless you're extraordinarily good at giv=
ing it strategic intent and excellent context. Then it can reason across yo=
ur specific information. But even in those cases where I prompt very well, =
I typically find I=E2=80=99m wading through a lot of =E2=80=9Cnot quite=E2=
=80=9D to get to the gem of =E2=80=9Cah=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s fantastic.=
=E2=80=9D Again, jagged intelligence.
This highlights another tricky thing about jagged intelligence: it can be m=
ade less jagged if you prompt better. Better communication of intent can er=
ase some gaps. You'll still feel the gaps. I still feel it because AI is re=
ally good at outlining but often not as good at capturing tone the way I wa=
nt. I'm very picky about tone. I feel it when asking AI to think about stra=
tegy=E2=80=94AI is good as a sounding board but doesn't feel as refined as =
needed.
The more you cultivate high taste, the more you cultivate saying "it can be=
 better and I know how," the more sensitive you'll be to jagged intelligenc=
e. My challenge: where is your taste bar? If you can't sense jagged intelli=
gence, have you insisted on a high enough bar with AI? I bet you know somet=
hing better than AI, and you can start insisting on a high bar there. Start=
 cultivating your sense of taste, and your awareness of jagged intelligence=
 will follow.
When to Use Big Prompts Versus Casual Chats
Third concept: when do you apply big prompts versus casual chats? I get thi=
s question because people look at my Substack and think =E2=80=9CNate alway=
s does big prompts.=E2=80=9D
NOPE. I write big prompts it=E2=80=99s true. But here=E2=80=99s why: the pl=
anning and thoughtfulness that go into an excellent prompt pay off when I h=
ave an important task. When I need to iterate and discover as I go, it pays=
 more often to start with a sharp one or two liner.
You might think that means I value the big prompt work more. No again. It's=
 more nuanced. If it's important and needs to be anchored around lots of co=
ntext you provide, a big prompt makes sense. If it's casual and/or iterativ=
e, longer conversations with shorter prompts to start make sense. With iter=
ative tasks, you're discovering meaning with AI as you go. So start shorter=
 with just a bit of sharp intent, like a little compass to lead the way.
Larger prompts are for anchoring around a specific topic. Sure, you'll have=
 multi-turn conversations, but within that box you've set with strategic in=
tent at the top and a big prompt. If you're trying to iterate, riff, brains=
torm, and think through things, it's often much more useful to start with a=
 very short prompt and leave the model room to expand.
It's deceptive to think meaningful work gets done only with big prompts, be=
cause I can get very meaningful work done with short prompts that I kick ba=
ck and forth rapidly if I need to discover meaning iteratively.=20
My encouragement: is this work something I already know enough about that I=
 want to focus on production? Probably a bigger prompt.=20
Is this work something I don't even know the shape of and need to discover?=
 Probably a shorter prompt.=20
Both can be valuable.
So don=E2=80=99t think "Nate writes big prompts, so I have to as well."=20
My ask is that you realize why prompts work the way they do and get intenti=
onal about knowing when to use larger, formal prompts versus casual ones.
Your Weekly Practice
Putting this together, you'll get farther with AI this week if you can do a=
 couple of exercises that help you think through these challenges.
Find something you can tokenize this week=E2=80=94something you haven't tok=
enized yet. I scribble stuff on notepads constantly. Terrible handwriting. =
I find that with the right model=E2=80=94o3 is better at this=E2=80=94I can=
 visually process that data, get it into text, and tokenize it. That's toke=
nization for me. You can find one for you.
Look for something that feels jagged with AI and be intentional about culti=
vating the strength=E2=80=94the peak, the good part, the Shakespeare part=
=E2=80=94rather than the part that isn't so intelligent. Especially pick so=
mething where you can tell what=E2=80=99s good, so you are practicing that =
taste bar.
Keep an eye on how often you feel like the prompt fit the project. If it fi=
ts most of the time, that's fantastic. If it doesn=E2=80=99t, it=E2=80=99s =
an invitation to figure out how you understand the relationship between you=
r intent, your work, and the AI.
These three pieces, if you get them, will help you enormously in understand=
ing how to use and augment AI. These are the corner pieces of the puzzle. I=
f you get these three down, you=E2=80=99re going to be able to follow along=
 with a lot of much more advanced AI concepts easily, because you=E2=80=99r=
e already thinking about data, how AI understands intent, and where AI is g=
ood (or not good) at jobs.
Good luck out there this week!

does tokenize mean? Very simply, ask yourself if a piece of data could appe=

ble. (Nvidia has a great token explanation </span><a href=3D"https://substa=

sk as a whole. But I always start with the data and tokens first. Can I eve=
n fit it in? Can the tokens go into the system? Then we get to subsequent q=
uestions: Is there too much data? Is it too big for the context window? Is =
the task too multifaceted for a single prompt? Or is it too complex for AI =
to handle with nuance? AI often polishes off the nuance in a task.</p><p st=

tle with this constantly, and this makes moving forward on AI harder for la=
rger data problems (but of course you get leverage if you can do it success=
fully).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=

 it fits in a Word doc, maybe whether you can sketch it on a napkin, since =
a napkin test is a handy test for context window size. If you can draw the =
complexity on a napkin, AI can be very helpful. If you can't fit the comple=
xity onto the napkin, it may be too complex for nuanced AI perspective. Kee=
p in mind you can fit everything from the Amazon Flywheel to the concept of=

in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Mov=
ing from tokenization: jagged intelligence. Again, people's eyes glaze over=
. Jagged intelligence simply means we have AIs that are in some ways as sma=
rt as Einstein and in other ways worse than the worst intern you've ever me=
t. I was a pretty bad intern myself.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The problem: AI is not=
 a continuous intelligence surface. It has really large gaps driven by know=
n issues, particularly around memory. If AI can't remember something, it ca=
n't learn as it goes. Yes, LLM teams are working on this, but it's a hard p=
roblem without much progress yet. For now, it's very difficult to get AI to=
 consistently do certain simple things that require memory.</p><p style=3D"=
margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
>For example, if you talk to AI about your role and ask it to write an exce=
llent article, proposal, or email, you have to re-explain what you want aga=
in and again. If you make any mistake re-explaining, your faithful AI will =
make a mistake. That's jagged intelligence. It's good enough to write those=
 outputs really well but not good enough to remember how to do it or avoid =
being extremely sensitive to briefing mistakes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think of it=
 as Shakespeare obsessed with following instructions. If you make any mista=
ke in the instructions, Shakespeare makes mistakes. This is why prompting m=
atters so much=E2=80=94you're trying to get the LLM to do what it does best=
 rather than getting stuck where it doesn't do well.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Organi=
zations come up with all sorts of tricks for this (saving prompts, figuring=
 out RAG architectures for memory management, etc.) but ultimately they=E2=
=80=99re all trying to work around the fundamental limitation that you have=
 to re-explain stuff to the AI a LOT.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Other low points in j=
agged intelligence: math. LLMs will call other tools to do math. There are =
specialized models=E2=80=94Gemini has one, OpenAI apparently has one that d=
oes math Olympiad problems. But when it comes to &quot;is 9.9 or 9.11 bigge=
r,&quot; LLMs can still struggle. If you're trying to understand mathematic=
al modeling of concepts or weigh business levers, you get some insight from=
 AI, but I find it tends to cluster around existing distributions of strate=
gic advice=E2=80=94think McKinsey deck-level abstraction. It doesn't tend t=
o be deeply insightful unless you're extraordinarily good at giving it stra=
tegic intent and excellent context. Then it can reason across your specific=
 information. But even in those cases where I prompt very well, I typically=
 find I=E2=80=99m wading through a lot of =E2=80=9Cnot quite=E2=80=9D to ge=
t to the gem of =E2=80=9Cah=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s fantastic.=E2=80=9D Agai=
n, jagged intelligence.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This highlights another tricky thin=
g about jagged intelligence: it can be made less jagged if you prompt bette=
r. Better communication of intent can erase some gaps. You'll still feel th=
e gaps. I still feel it because AI is really good at outlining but often no=
t as good at capturing tone the way I want. I'm very picky about tone. I fe=
el it when asking AI to think about strategy=E2=80=94AI is good as a soundi=
ng board but doesn't feel as refined as needed.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The more yo=
u cultivate high taste, the more you cultivate saying &quot;it can be bette=
r and I know how,&quot; the more sensitive you'll be to jagged intelligence=
. My challenge: where is your taste bar? If you can't sense jagged intellig=
ence, have you insisted on a high enough bar with AI? I bet you know someth=
ing better than AI, and you can start insisting on a high bar there. Start =
cultivating your sense of taste, and your awareness of jagged intelligence =
will follow.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relativ=

/h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">Third concept: when do you apply big prompts versus casual=
 chats? I get this question because people look at my Substack and think =
=E2=80=9CNate always does big prompts.=E2=80=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">NOPE. I wri=
te big prompts it=E2=80=99s true. But here=E2=80=99s why: the planning and =
thoughtfulness that go into an excellent prompt pay off when I have an impo=
rtant task. When I need to iterate and discover as I go, it pays more often=
 to start with a sharp one or two liner.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>You might th=
ink that means I value the big prompt work more. No again. It's more nuance=
d. If it's important </span><em>and</em><span> needs to be anchored around =
lots of context you provide, a big prompt makes sense. If it's casual and/o=
r iterative, longer conversations with shorter prompts to start make sense.=
 With iterative tasks, you're discovering meaning with AI as you go. So sta=
rt shorter with just a bit of sharp intent, like a little compass to lead t=
he way.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Larger prompts are for anchoring around a sp=
ecific topic. Sure, you'll have multi-turn conversations, but within that b=
ox you've set with strategic intent at the top and a big prompt. If you're =
trying to iterate, riff, brainstorm, and think through things, it's often m=
uch more useful to start with a very short prompt and leave the model room =
to expand.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
