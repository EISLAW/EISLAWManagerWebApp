A TALE OF TWO ELECTIONS [3]
RECENT VOTES IN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA SIGNAL A GROWING WARINESS TOWARD THE U.S.
BY: RONAN WORDSWORTH
In the space of a week, two of the United States’ closest historical allies held elections over which the shadow of Washington loomed large. The votes in Canada and Australia, held on April 28 and
May 3 respectively, had several similarities – but also notable differences. At the beginning of the year, the center-left parties in both countries were significantly trailing in the polls, leading
many to conclude that conservative candidates would likely be victorious in the upcoming elections. What actually happened was a rapid turnaround for Canada’s Liberal Party and Australia’s Labor
Party. Both now look set to continue their multilateralist and trade-friendly policies, which are at odds with much of the rhetoric coming from their close ally in Washington.
SURPRISE RESULT
The center-left parties were the incumbents in both elections. In Canada, Mark Carney became prime minister in March after being named Liberal Party leader following Justin Trudeau’s resignation
after nearly a decade in office. In Australia, Anthony Albanese was running for reelection after serving one term with a slim majority government. Both leaders were expected to lose after a shaky 2024
for their parties. However, they pulled out surprising wins amid disappointing results for their conservative rivals. In both cases, the leader of the main center-right party, Pierre Poilievre in
Canada and Peter Dutton in Australia, even lost his own parliamentary seat in the election.
[Support for Political Parties in Canada] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
It’s important to understand the factors that led to such large swings in political fortune for the parties involved. One of the most important was what’s been happening in Washington. About a
year ago, conservative voices in many Western countries were looking to emulate Donald Trump’s campaign messages, promising to overhaul government and cut wasteful spending, promoting “country
first” initiatives, and vowing to limit immigration. However, over the past few months, conservative parties in Canada and Australia tried to distance themselves from Trumpian policies. For example,
Dutton’s initial flagship policy was to restrict work-from-home arrangements for government employees – similar to Elon Musk’s call for federal workers in the U.S. to return to the office –
but he reversed course after it became clear that it was an unpopular stance. It was an early sign that this brand of conservatism might fall flat outside the U.S.
The main domestic concerns for voters in both Canada and Australia were the cost of living, the economy, housing, and taxes, while on the foreign policy front, the main considerations were the U.S.
and China. Canadians in particular felt increasingly wary of U.S. intentions amid Trump’s repeated references to the country as the “cherished 51st state of the USA.” Comments like these proved
hugely unpopular, with polls suggesting that between 75 percent and over 90 percent of the population would never support joining the U.S. Trump also repeatedly referred to former Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau as “governor Trudeau,” another move that galvanized support for the Liberal Party.
In addition to these controversial comments, the U.S. has placed significant tariffs on Canadian industries. In February, Washington announced 25 percent tariffs on Canadian imports, related to the
smuggling of fentanyl crossing the border (despite fentanyl seizures in 2022-24 at the northern border totaling just 59 pounds, compared to 61,900 pounds at the southern border). Then, Trump said the
tariffs would apply to goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, including steel, energy, potash, timber and automobiles. This policy could have a major impact on the Canadian
economy, considering that the U.S. accounted for 75.9 percent of Canadian exports in 2024. Canada’s gross domestic product is projected to decline 2.28 percent year on year as a result of the
tariffs.
Trump’s comments and the trade uncertainty gave a significant boost in the polls to the Liberal Party, which had grown unpopular under Trudeau. When Carney was chosen as the new Liberal Party
leader, he distanced himself from Trudeau. A former economist and governor of the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of England, Carney was seen as a political outsider who was well-positioned to
take on Trump in the economic arena. The Liberals won the election but fell short of a majority by two seats.
Australia was in a somewhat different position heading into the election earlier this month. Albanese had served one term and didn’t have the same baggage as Canada’s Liberals. The Labor Party was
more consistent in its messaging over the past year, and while Trump-like rhetoric was effective during the U.S. election campaign, it has been less so since January.
While Canada had a significant trade surplus with the U.S., Australia has consistently had one of the highest trade deficits with the United States over the past decade, leaving Canberra in a good
position to negotiate. However, though most Australian exports will be taxed at the blanket 10 percent rate, the U.S. will impose 25 percent tariffs on Australian processed steel and aluminum.
(Processed steel and aluminum will be taxed at 25 percent.) This likely won’t have a huge economic impact, though the optics aren’t great considering that many Australians believe their country to
be a loyal U.S. ally.
For Australian voters, the other major consideration was the relationship with China, Australia’s largest trade partner. Despite the two countries being engaged in a trade war since 2020, Beijing
has remained vital to Australia’s economy. Trade tensions have thawed in recent months, so Canberra was reluctant to antagonize Beijing even in an election year. Albanese maintained that his policy
toward China would be balanced and that Australia would not follow the U.S.’ lead by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. (The slump in the Australian stock market following Trump’s tariffs
announcement, despite Australia getting off relatively easy, was an indicator of how critical China is to the Australian economy.)
The result for Albanese was a sizable victory in the election, the first back-to-back win for an Australian prime minister in over 20 years. The Labor Party even increased its seats in parliament from
77 seats to likely 94 seats out 150. The opposition coalition led by the center-right Liberal Party saw a record drop from 58 seats to 43. Attributing this result solely to the “Trump effect”
would understate the frustration of Australian voters with the opposition’s platform, which changed several times over the past few months. However, it’s undeniable that Trump and U.S. policies
played a role.
Notably, it’s not just the tariffs but also their uneven application that has been negatively received around the world. The Trump administration’s repeated introduction and pausing of different
tariff rates have created economic uncertainty and affected stock markets in Canada, Australia and beyond. The publics in these countries have viewed this approach overwhelmingly negatively. According
to a recent opinion poll, Australians’ trust in the U.S. to act responsibly in the world is at an all-time low, with 64 percent of respondents saying they hold “not very much” trust or no trust
“at all” in the U.S. Meanwhile, 81 percent of respondents disapprove of using tariffs to pressure other countries.
WHAT THIS MEANS
The incumbent governments of both countries were very much in favor of Western alliances, including NATO, the Five Eyes and AUKUS. Following their victories, they are now looking to increase defense
ties with other allies to reduce reliance on Washington, but this will not be an easy task for either.
Canada has turned to Europe. Carney spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this month, and they agreed to strengthen defense and commercial ties. Carney also made his first overseas
trip (to Paris) after assuming the prime ministership in March. He met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week and agreed to expand trade relations. In March, Canada signed a
$4 billion agreement with Australia to develop an over-the-horizon radar system to help protect the country’s northern regions and support Canada’s NORAD commitments. Australia was previously in
talks on selling the system to the United States.
For Australia, the U.S. will remain vital to its long-term defense. Through the AUKUS program, the two are developing (along with the U.K.) next-generation nuclear-powered submarines, set to be
delivered to Canberra by 2032. Prior to the election, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles met with U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and announced that Canberra had completed its first
payment of $500 million (out of a total $3 billion) toward U.S. shipbuilding facilities. The money will support the expansion of Virginia-class submarine production facilities ahead of the first
submarine transfers.
On China, however, the U.S. stands largely alone in its attempt to isolate Beijing. While the conservative parties in Canada and Australia pushed for a tougher stance on China, the incumbent parties
remained committed to the status quo. Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the government remained determined to increase Australia’s share of exports to China. He also emphasized that
Canberra would reject U.S. demands to reduce economic and trade ties with Beijing. Australian exports to China are nearly 10 times the value of exports to the U.S., a figure that’s likely to
increase as tariffs take effect. Ahead of talks with the EU trade commissioner on a free trade deal this week, the minister also said Europe and Australia would show the world that “protectionism is
not the way to go.”
Ottawa, meanwhile, has maintained a “firm but measured” approach to China, which is Canada’s second-largest trade partner behind the U.S. In March, Carney said China does not share Canada’s
values on trade. However, it was reported last week that China has become the top customer for Canadian oil shipped via the Trans Mountain pipeline, surpassing the U.S. The development comes amid
China’s search for alternatives to Russian oil and increased tensions between Ottawa and Washington.
There’s one more key takeaway from the elections. While there’s a perception (certainly in Europe) that support for the political extremes is increasing, the middle ground is still dominant, as
least in some countries. Polarizing policies seemed more popular in some countries in the months leading up to Trump’s inauguration, but more recent elections have paved a path for centrist
candidates to win out. This could be an indicator of how upcoming elections in Europe might swing.
While the two elections took place under different circumstances, they could indicate broader political trends in the Western world. They signaled a rejection of Trump-style populism and reaffirmed
support for centrist, pro-alliance, and economically pragmatic governance. While domestic considerations played a key role, Washington’s looming presence had a significant impact on both
electorates. As a result, close allies of the U.S. are reinforcing their own international ties, diversifying their economic partnerships and subtly asserting a more independent foreign policy
posture.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the space of a =
week, two of the United States=E2=80=99 closest historical allies held elec=
tions over which the shadow of Washington loomed large. The votes in Canada=
 and Australia, held on April 28 and May 3 respectively, had several simila=
rities =E2=80=93 but also notable differences. At the beginning of the year=
, the center-left parties in both countries were significantly trailing in =
the polls, leading many to conclude that conservative candidates would like=
ly be victorious in the upcoming elections. What actually happened was a ra=
pid turnaround for Canada=E2=80=99s Liberal Party and Australia=E2=80=99s L=
abor Party. Both now look set to continue their multilateralist and trade-f=
riendly policies, which are at odds with much of the rhetoric coming from t=
heir close ally in Washington.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Surprise R=
esult</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The center-left pa=
rties were the incumbents in both elections. In Canada, Mark Carney became =
prime minister in March after being named Liberal Party leader following Ju=
stin Trudeau=E2=80=99s resignation after nearly a decade in office. In Aust=
ralia, Anthony Albanese was running for reelection after serving one term w=
ith a slim majority government. Both leaders were expected to lose after a =
shaky 2024 for their parties. However, they pulled out surprising wins amid=
 disappointing results for their conservative rivals. In both cases, the le=
ader of the main center-right party, Pierre Poilievre in Canada and Peter D=
utton in Australia, even lost his own parliamentary seat in the election.</=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s impor=
tant to understand the factors that led to such large swings in political f=
ortune for the parties involved. One of the most important was what=E2=80=
=99s been happening in Washington. About a year ago, conservative voices in=
 many Western countries were looking to emulate Donald Trump=E2=80=99s camp=
aign messages, promising to overhaul government and cut wasteful spending, =
promoting =E2=80=9Ccountry first=E2=80=9D initiatives, and vowing to limit =
immigration. However, over the past few months, conservative parties in Can=
ada and Australia tried to distance themselves from Trumpian policies. For =
example, Dutton=E2=80=99s initial flagship policy was to restrict work-from=
-home arrangements for government employees =E2=80=93 similar to Elon Musk=
=E2=80=99s call for federal workers in the U.S. to return to the office =E2=
=80=93 but he reversed course after it became clear that it was an unpopula=
r stance. It was an early sign that this brand of conservatism might fall f=
lat outside the U.S.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The main domestic =
concerns for voters in both Canada and Australia were the cost of living, t=
he economy, housing, and taxes, while on the foreign policy front, the main=
 considerations were the U.S. and China. Canadians in particular felt incre=
asingly wary of U.S. intentions amid Trump=E2=80=99s repeated references to=
 the country as the =E2=80=9Ccherished 51st state of the USA.=E2=80=9D Comm=
ents like these proved hugely unpopular, with polls suggesting that between=
 75 percent and over 90 percent of the population would never support joini=
ng the U.S. Trump also repeatedly referred to former Prime Minister Justin =
Trudeau as =E2=80=9Cgovernor Trudeau,=E2=80=9D another move that galvanized=
 support for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In addition to the=
se controversial comments, the U.S. has placed significant tariffs on Canad=
ian industries. In February, Washington announced 25 percent tariffs on Can=
adian imports, related to the smuggling of fentanyl crossing the border (de=
spite fentanyl seizures in 2022-24 at the northern border totaling just 59 =
pounds, compared to 61,900 pounds at the southern border). Then, Trump said=
 the tariffs would apply to goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada tra=
de agreement, including steel, energy, potash, timber and automobiles. This=
 policy could have a major impact on the Canadian economy, considering that=
 the U.S. accounted for 75.9 percent of Canadian exports in 2024. Canada=E2=
=80=99s gross domestic product is projected to decline 2.28 percent year on=
 year as a result of the tariffs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump=E2=80=99s co=
mments and the trade uncertainty gave a significant boost in the polls to t=
he Liberal Party, which had grown unpopular under Trudeau. When Carney was =
chosen as the new Liberal Party leader, he distanced himself from Trudeau. =
A former economist and governor of the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank =
of England, Carney was seen as a political outsider who was well-positioned=
 to take on Trump in the economic arena. The Liberals won the election but =
fell short of a majority by two seats.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Australia was in a=
 somewhat different position heading into the election earlier this month. =
Albanese had served one term and didn=E2=80=99t have the same baggage as Ca=
nada=E2=80=99s Liberals. The Labor Party was more consistent in its messagi=
ng over the past year, and while Trump-like rhetoric was effective during t=
he U.S. election campaign, it has been less so since January.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While Canada had a=
 significant trade surplus with the U.S., Australia has consistently had on=
e of the highest trade deficits with the United States over the past decade=
, leaving Canberra in a good position to negotiate. However, though most Au=
stralian exports will be taxed at the blanket 10 percent rate, the U.S. wil=
l impose 25 percent tariffs on Australian processed steel and aluminum. (Pr=
ocessed steel and aluminum will be taxed at 25 percent.) This likely won=E2=
=80=99t have a huge economic impact, though the optics aren=E2=80=99t great=
 considering that many Australians believe their country to be a loyal U.S.=
 ally.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For Australian vot=
ers, the other major consideration was the relationship with China, Austral=
ia=E2=80=99s largest trade partner. Despite the two countries being engaged=
 in a trade war since 2020, Beijing has remained vital to Australia=E2=80=
=99s economy. Trade tensions have thawed in recent months, so Canberra was =
reluctant to antagonize Beijing even in an election year. Albanese maintain=
ed that his policy toward China would be balanced and that Australia would =
not follow the U.S.=E2=80=99 lead by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. (Th=
e slump in the Australian stock market following Trump=E2=80=99s tariffs an=
nouncement, despite Australia getting off relatively easy, was an indicator=
 of how critical China is to the Australian economy.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The result for Alb=
anese was a sizable victory in the election, the first back-to-back win for=
 an Australian prime minister in over 20 years. The Labor Party even increa=
sed its seats in parliament from 77 seats to likely 94 seats out 150. The o=
pposition coalition led by the center-right Liberal Party saw a record drop=
 from 58 seats to 43. Attributing this result solely to the =E2=80=9CTrump =
effect=E2=80=9D would understate the frustration of Australian voters with =
the opposition=E2=80=99s platform, which changed several times over the pas=
t few months. However, it=E2=80=99s undeniable that Trump and U.S. policies=
 played a role.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Notably, it=E2=80=
=99s not just the tariffs but also their uneven application that has been n=
egatively received around the world. The Trump administration=E2=80=99s rep=
eated introduction and pausing of different tariff rates have created econo=
mic uncertainty and affected stock markets in Canada, Australia and beyond.=
 The publics in these countries have viewed this approach overwhelmingly ne=
gatively. According to a recent opinion poll, Australians=E2=80=99 trust in=
 the U.S. to act responsibly in the world is at an all-time low, with 64 pe=
rcent of respondents saying they hold =E2=80=9Cnot very much=E2=80=9D trust=
 or no trust =E2=80=9Cat all=E2=80=9D in the U.S. Meanwhile, 81 percent of =
respondents disapprove of using tariffs to pressure other countries.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>What This =
Means</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The incumbent gove=
rnments of both countries were very much in favor of Western alliances, inc=
luding NATO, the Five Eyes and AUKUS. Following their victories, they are n=
ow looking to increase defense ties with other allies to reduce reliance on=
 Washington, but this will not be an easy task for either.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Canada has turned =
to Europe. Carney spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier th=
is month, and they agreed to strengthen defense and commercial ties. Carney=
 also made his first overseas trip (to Paris) after assuming the prime mini=
stership in March. He met with European Commission President Ursula von der=
 Leyen last week and agreed to expand trade relations. In March, Canada sig=
ned a $4 billion agreement with Australia to develop an over-the-horizon ra=
dar system to help protect the country=E2=80=99s northern regions and suppo=
rt Canada=E2=80=99s NORAD commitments. Australia was previously in talks on=
 selling the system to the United States.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For Australia, the=
 U.S. will remain vital to its long-term defense. Through the AUKUS program=
, the two are developing (along with the U.K.) next-generation nuclear-powe=
red submarines, set to be delivered to Canberra by 2032. Prior to the elect=
ion, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles met with U.S. Secretary of =
Defense Pete Hegseth and announced that Canberra had completed its first pa=
yment of $500 million (out of a total $3 billion) toward U.S. shipbuilding =
facilities. The money will support the expansion of Virginia-class submarin=
e production facilities ahead of the first submarine transfers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On China, however,=
 the U.S. stands largely alone in its attempt to isolate Beijing. While the=
 conservative parties in Canada and Australia pushed for a tougher stance o=
n China, the incumbent parties remained committed to the status quo. Austra=
lian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the government remained determined to =
increase Australia=E2=80=99s share of exports to China. He also emphasized =
that Canberra would reject U.S. demands to reduce economic and trade ties w=
ith Beijing. Australian exports to China are nearly 10 times the value of e=
xports to the U.S., a figure that=E2=80=99s likely to increase as tariffs t=
ake effect. Ahead of talks with the EU trade commissioner on a free trade d=
eal this week, the minister also said Europe and Australia would show the w=
orld that =E2=80=9Cprotectionism is not the way to go.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ottawa, meanwhile,=
 has maintained a =E2=80=9Cfirm but measured=E2=80=9D approach to China, wh=
ich is Canada=E2=80=99s second-largest trade partner behind the U.S. In Mar=
ch, Carney said China does not share Canada=E2=80=99s values on trade. Howe=
ver, it was reported last week that China has become the top customer for C=
anadian oil shipped via the Trans Mountain pipeline, surpassing the U.S. Th=
e development comes amid China=E2=80=99s search for alternatives to Russian=
 oil and increased tensions between Ottawa and Washington.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There=E2=80=99s on=
e more key takeaway from the elections. While there=E2=80=99s a perception =
(certainly in Europe) that support for the political extremes is increasing=
, the middle ground is still dominant, as least in some countries. Polarizi=
ng policies seemed more popular in some countries in the months leading up =
to Trump=E2=80=99s inauguration, but more recent elections have paved a pat=
h for centrist candidates to win out. This could be an indicator of how upc=
oming elections in Europe might swing.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While the two elec=
tions took place under different circumstances, they could indicate broader=
 political trends in the Western world. They signaled a rejection of Trump-=
style populism and reaffirmed support for centrist, pro-alliance, and econo=
mically pragmatic governance. While domestic considerations played a key ro=
le, Washington=E2=80=99s looming presence had a significant impact on both =
electorates. As a result, close allies of the U.S. are reinforcing their ow=
n international ties, diversifying their economic partnerships and subtly a=
sserting a more independent foreign policy posture.</p>
