Look this is just straight up a spicy take and lots of people will disagree=
=2E
Everyone wants to ooh and ahh about the latest model. The model makers them=
selves encourage you to think like this. Wait and the additional intelligen=
ce will fix everything!
Next month=E2=80=99s models will matter! o3 Pro coming out will change it! =
(That is probably coming this week by the way.) Great. Fine. I=E2=80=99m no=
t here to say intelligence scaling doesn=E2=80=99t matter=E2=80=94if you re=
ad this Substack you know I take the search for a new everyday model very s=
eriously.
But, my observation is that the best model in careless hands is worse than =
useless. Work doesn=E2=80=99t get done faster. Rewriting customer emails to=
 make them 10% more professional isn=E2=80=99t really adding value at this =
point.
The value is in actually thinking about how we handle data inputs to AI, bu=
t that takes work and to be honest it=E2=80=99s not as popular. If we took =
50% of the passion we put into the latest model and put it into getting our=
 data inputs right we=E2=80=99d get twice the leverage. Or more. So yes, pr=
ompts matter (I=E2=80=99m working on that here). But so does your actual da=
ta! And that=E2=80=99s what this post is about. How can you practical use y=
our data with AI?
I give you a real life example, and some principles to think about, and I c=
all out where I think this highlights the need for more human judgement, no=
t less. Enjoy!

The Narrow-Pipe Law
Feed a narrow, noise-free stream into any off-the-shelf language model and =
its value explodes relative to cost. That single observation has reordered =
how I think about =E2=80=9CAI at work=E2=80=9D more than every white-paper =
curve and benchmark combined.
I learned it the hard way on a Monday that should have been routine. Our pr=
oduct-planning spreadsheet=E2=80=94fifty rows of roadmap bets, metrics, and=
 owner initials=E2=80=94had been circulating for a week. By 9:00 a.m. the d=
oc looked like a street market after closing: colors everywhere, cells over=
written mid-formula, six comment threads arguing past each other.=20
While I chased conflicting revenue figures, Slack pinged with something dif=
ferent: an auto-generated digest of last week=E2=80=99s customer calls. Thr=
ee paragraphs, perfectly framed, zero hallucinations, produced in less time=
 than it took me to scroll to row twenty-seven of the spreadsheet.
The contrast slapped me awake. The spreadsheet contained every scrap of dat=
a we thought might matter; the call digest contained only the things that d=
id. Because the input stream feeding Slack was brutally narrow=E2=80=94just=
 three mandatory fields posted after each call=E2=80=94the summarizer spent=
 zero energy guessing context and all its energy producing insight. My bloa=
ted Google Sheet, by comparison, asked humans to separate wheat from chaff =
before the model ever had a chance.
That=E2=80=99s what I call the Narrow-Pipe Law in action. The potency of an=
 AI engine is limited less by its architecture than by the messiness of wha=
t you pour into it. Tighten the pipe, kill the noise, and even a commodity =
model behaves like a bespoke analyst. Leave the pipe wide open and the smar=
test system in the world will cough up hedges and half-truths.
Everything else in this essay=E2=80=94clean-input culture, AI-ready channel=
s, the new shape of product leadership=E2=80=94flows from that realization.
From Craftspeople to Curators =E2=80=94 Why Clean Inputs Change the Culture=
, Not Just the Output
If the narrow-pipe law feels mechanical, the cultural shock it triggers is =
anything but. The moment a model can pull crisp insight from a sliver of te=
xt, the old heroics of =E2=80=9Cowning the deck=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cperfec=
ting the doc=E2=80=9D stop making sense. I=E2=80=99ve lived through that ad=
justment, and I=E2=80=99ve noticed it rewires four long-standing reflexes:
Signal over artifact.
A decade of PM muscle memory tells us the polished document is the delivera=
ble. In an AI-first flow, the deliverable is a decision-ready signal=E2=80=
=94a one-sentence risk call-out, a flagged revenue anomaly, a verbatim cust=
omer quote tied to ARR. Anything bulkier is latent debt that someone (often=
 you) will pay down later.
Public flow instead of private work.
Half-baked drafts hidden in Drive once felt polite; now they starve the mod=
el of context and force colleagues to beg for status. When transcripts, que=
ry logs, or snapshot metrics land in an open, single-purpose stream, both h=
umans and machines can act on them instantly.
Perpetual pilots beat perfect plans.
When iteration costs pennies, waiting to polish a grand rollout is riskier =
than shipping a safe-to-fail slice today. The teams that internalise this r=
hythm accumulate prompt libraries, schema conventions, and trust in their f=
eedback loops=E2=80=94assets late adopters can=E2=80=99t copy overnight.
Humans as quality gates, not assembly lines.
Someone still owns tone, accuracy, and ethics; that person simply intervene=
s at the end of the pipe, not the start. My title has shifted from document=
 author to editor of record. The work is lighter but the accountability is =
sharper.
None of these shifts require a new tool. They require the discipline to dec=
ide=E2=80=94up front=E2=80=94what belongs in the pipe and what stays outsid=
e. That single act of upstream craftsmanship gives every downstream model t=
he freedom to be brilliant.
Slack Hack =E2=80=94 Turning a Channel into a Living Dataset
Most teams treat Slack like a river of conversation; the new Summarize butt=
on skims that river and hands you a quick recap of who said what. Useful=E2=
=80=94but ordinary. (Sorry Slack I said it.)
The real leverage appears when you reverse the flow: instead of asking the =
model to tame messy dialogue, you feed it only the material you=E2=80=99d w=
ant a chief-of-staff to digest in the first place.
How it works in practice
I dedicate a private channel=E2=80=94say, #summaries-input=E2=80=94to be no=
thing but source material. The rule set is human, not technical:
If the content will matter in three weeks, drop it in. Grain transcripts, r=
aw Zoom notes, voice-memo brainstorms, decision logs, KPIs at the moment th=
ey=E2=80=99re declared=E2=80=94anything future-me will need in one scroll.
If it=E2=80=99s idle chatter or off-topic context, keep it out. Jokes, =E2=
=80=9Cgot it, thanks,=E2=80=9D or half-formed DMs belong elsewhere. They po=
llute the dataset and dilute the model=E2=80=99s extractive power.
Slack=E2=80=99s model doesn=E2=80=99t care that these posts lack conversati=
on threads or emoji reactions; it only sees a chronologically ordered corpu=
s. Because the input is already decision-grade, Summarize stops emitting he=
dged =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s what people discussed=E2=80=9D blurbs and star=
ts delivering paragraphs you can drop straight into a weekly update:
=E2=80=A2 Customer-call themes this week: pricing confusion on the mid-tier=
, strong interest in the new compliance dashboard, no objections about migr=
ation time.
=E2=80=A2 Two decisions logged: switch analytics vendor by Q3; freeze UI wo=
rk on Settings until post-launch.
=E2=80=A2 KPI note: DAU dipped 3 % after the paywall test; attribution poin=
ts to first-run friction.
That digest lands in seconds, not hours, because the model never had to wad=
e through memes and status pings.
Why the narrow pipe multiplies value
Zero energy on triage. The model doesn=E2=80=99t waste tokens guessing whic=
h sentences matter; every line is presumed signal.
Instant institutional memory. New teammates scroll the channel, hit Summari=
ze, and ingest a month of context in one cup of coffee.
Compounding accuracy. Because the feed is disciplined, noise never =E2=80=
=9Cdrifts=E2=80=9D the model. Each additional post sharpens the corpus rath=
er than diluting it.
Guardrails that keep the pipe clean
Curating a dataset-in-a-channel takes less policy than you=E2=80=99d think=
=E2=80=94just two norms you enforce relentlessly:
Single purpose. The channel exists only to capture raw artefacts worth summ=
arising. If a message doesn=E2=80=99t help future you, it never crosses the=
 threshold.
Lightweight policing. A nudge=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s move this chat=
 to #general=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94suffices. People obey because they taste the =
value the first time they press Summarize.
The bigger point
Notice what changed: no new integration, no custom prompt, no special schem=
a. All I supplied was judgment about what belongs in the pipe. Slack=E2=80=
=99s commodity model did the rest. That=E2=80=99s the Narrow-Pipe Law on di=
splay: tighten the stream, and even baseline AI features behave like bespok=
e analysts.
Up next, we=E2=80=99ll pull the camera back to see how this same principle =
scales beyond Slack=E2=80=94into release notes, support queues, and KPI fee=
ds=E2=80=94wherever a little upstream discipline can unlock a lot of downst=
ream intelligence.
Narrow Pipe =E2=86=92 Large Engine
The Slack experiment isn=E2=80=99t a one-off trick; it exposes a general la=
w. Modern SaaS tools already ship with a surprisingly capable language mode=
l under the hood=E2=80=94Slack=E2=80=99s Summarize, Notion=E2=80=99s AI blo=
cks, Google Workspace=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CHelp me write,=E2=80=9D and dozens=
 more.=20
Those engines share a weakness: they spend most of their capacity sifting t=
hrough noisy, mixed-purpose text before they can even start generating insi=
ght. Give the engine a narrow, noise-free pipe and the ratio flips. Every t=
oken goes to analysis instead of triage, so the same commodity model sudden=
ly performs like a bespoke analyst.
Why the engine is seldom the bottleneck
Most teams look for leverage in the next model upgrade=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CCan=
 we get GPT-5?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94but the real ceiling is context quality. A =
powerful engine fed junk will still output polite junk. Constrain the input=
 to a single, clearly defined stream and you unlock performance gains that =
dwarf the difference between model tiers. In effect, a narrow pipe turns a =
large engine from a generalist into a specialist=E2=80=94without changing a=
 line of code.
How to locate and build your next pipe
1. Identify repetitive information hotspots.
Scan your workflows for places where the same facts get rewritten or forwar=
ded=E2=80=94support escalations that bounce between teams, weekly release n=
otes scattered across GitHub comments, KPI snapshots pasted into chat. Repe=
tition signals a hidden pipe begging to be narrowed.
2. Define the minimal =E2=80=9Cdecision grade=E2=80=9D core.
For each hotspot, ask: What is the smallest payload that would let a reason=
able stakeholder act without chasing links? The answer is rarely more than =
three fields (for release notes: scope, user impact, rollback plan). If you=
 find yourself needing ten, you have chosen a slice that is still too broad=
=2E
3. Carve a single inlet and label it loudly.
Create one Slack channel, one Notion database, or one Google Sheet that exi=
sts only for this payload. Pin a two-line policy=E2=80=94what belongs and w=
hat does not=E2=80=94so newcomers learn by scrolling, not by reading a wiki=
=2E
4. Police the boundary upstream, not downstream.
When someone drops a screenshot or an off-topic comment into the inlet, nud=
ge them into a general channel. Upstream discipline costs a few seconds; do=
wnstream cleanup costs hours and erodes trust in the feed.
5. Turn on the bundled model and inspect the first output.
Activate whatever summarizer, classifier, or =E2=80=9CAI overview=E2=80=9D =
the platform provides. If the very first digest is not actionable, tighten =
the pipe further=E2=80=94shorten the payload, remove formatting noise, or s=
plit the stream into two separate channels.
6. Let improvements in the engine compound automatically.
Once the pipe is clean, every platform upgrade=E2=80=94better model weights=
, longer context windows, cheaper token pricing=E2=80=94drops straight to y=
our bottom line without another integration sprint.
A narrow pipe is leverage you own outright. It costs nothing to maintain, i=
t compounds as underlying models improve, and it converts the AI you alread=
y pay for into an always-on analyst that never asks for a larger budget.
The Human Edge =E2=80=94 Clarity Is Cheap Once the Bots Eat the Busy-Work; =
Conviction Is Not
Narrow pipes give us near-perfect situational awareness for pennies, but si=
tuational awareness is only the ante. Someone still has to turn clarity int=
o action, and no language model=E2=80=94bundled, fine-tuned, or otherwise=
=E2=80=94will volunteer for that job (yes I=E2=80=99m leaving agents out he=
re on purpose). After watching AI strip the clerical layer out of product w=
ork, I keep running into the same three responsibilities that refuse to bud=
ge:
Force accountability.
A model can draft an ROI table in five seconds, but a table doesn=E2=80=99t=
 create alignment. Humans have to decide whether those numbers are merely =
=E2=80=9Cinteresting=E2=80=9D or truly =E2=80=9Cbinding.=E2=80=9D Until a l=
iving person says, =E2=80=9CThese are now the bar=E2=80=94ship or explain,=
=E2=80=9D the metrics are scenery. Product leaders don=E2=80=99t earn their=
 keep by calculating targets; they earn it by ensuring someone=E2=80=99s re=
putation (often their own) is attached to hitting them.
Choose futures.
Even the fattest context window can=E2=80=99t feel brand risk, seasonality,=
 or the political cost of delaying a partner integration. We still need hum=
ans to weigh intangible trade-offs, assign probabilities, and bet the quart=
er on one scenario while gracefully killing the others. Judgment migrates u=
p the stack as clerical work vaporizes; if you can=E2=80=99t articulate why=
 you prefer one plausible future over another, expect your value to track t=
he clerical layer on its way to zero.
Stage confrontation.
Decision latency=E2=80=94the endless loop of =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s revisit=
 this next week=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94remains the biggest tax on momentum. AI ca=
n surface options; it cannot absorb the social blast radius of committing t=
o one. Sometimes leadership=E2=80=99s most useful act is to write the choic=
e down, circulate it, and dare the room to object. That willingness to own =
the heat of a decision is pure human capital, and its scarcity is exactly w=
hy it commands outsized influence.
Clean inputs and large engines gift us the time and mental bandwidth to foc=
us on these higher-order tasks. The opportunity (and the threat) is straigh=
tforward: if we spend the reclaimed hours polishing dashboards or fussing w=
ith prompt syntax, we forfeit the edge that machines still can=E2=80=99t to=
uch.
Use the clarity bots provide to force accountability, choose bold futures, =
and stage the confrontations your organization keeps postponing. That=E2=80=
=99s where the leverage lives now, and=E2=80=94at least for the next few mo=
del releases=E2=80=94where it will stay.
It=E2=80=99s the data that matters!
