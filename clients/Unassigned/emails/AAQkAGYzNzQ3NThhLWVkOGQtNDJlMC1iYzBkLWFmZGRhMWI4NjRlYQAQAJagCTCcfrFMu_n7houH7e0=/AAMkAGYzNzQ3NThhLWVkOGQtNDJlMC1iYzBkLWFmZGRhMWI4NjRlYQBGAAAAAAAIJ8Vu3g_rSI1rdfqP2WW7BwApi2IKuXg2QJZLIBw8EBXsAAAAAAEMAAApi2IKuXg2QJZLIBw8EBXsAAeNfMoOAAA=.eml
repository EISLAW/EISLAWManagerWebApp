OpenAI=E2=80=99s new prompt pack is so bad I feel like I have to write this=
 guide.
And I=E2=80=99m not kidding when I say I worry about teams following cheap-=
and-easy guides like the new 200 prompt pack [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/16c7bb3c-897e-4320-910b-ab8e146c36c7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmL=
QJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and getting fired. That=E2=80=99s how bad=
 the prompts are.
But this is part of a larger pattern.
I=E2=80=99ve been watching teams waste their AI potential for months now, a=
nd it=E2=80=99s been frustrating. Not because people are lazy or uninterest=
ed=E2=80=94but because they=E2=80=99re being told that AI adoption is like =
rolling out Slack or Zoom. Learn the basics, tick the box, move on.
When OpenAI released their enterprise prompt pack last week, I saw it as th=
e perfect example of what=E2=80=99s going wrong with AI education. Two hund=
red prompts that treat AI like it=E2=80=99s just better Google search. Gene=
ric templates that miss the entire point of what this technology can do.
So I built an alternative. Twelve workflow-driven prompts that show what ha=
ppens when you start with the actual pain points in your work instead of st=
arting with AI capabilities.
This isn=E2=80=99t a hit piece on OpenAI. They=E2=80=99re building incredib=
le technology. But someone needs to say clearly: if you think AI education =
is one-and-done, you=E2=80=99re going to wake up in 2026 wondering why you=
=E2=80=99re left behind while others are 10x more productive.
I care about this because I see the gap. I work with teams that are sitting=
 on 80-90% of untouched AI opportunity. They=E2=80=99re using ChatGPT for e=
mails while their engineers grind through 4-hour code reviews and their sal=
es teams make gut-based pipeline calls. The capability is there. The unders=
tanding of how to use it isn=E2=80=99t.
This post is my attempt to fix that. To show you what workflow-first AI edu=
cation actually looks like. And to give you twelve working examples you can=
 customize and use today.
Here=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re getting:
The core problem with current AI education =E2=80=93 why treating AI like o=
ne-and-done software adoption will leave your team behind as capabilities a=
dvance exponentially
The workflow-first methodology =E2=80=93 a step-by-step approach to buildin=
g AI into your actual work processes (not just =E2=80=9Cusing AI more=E2=80=
=9D)
12 production-ready prompts by job family:
3 engineering prompts (technical debt prioritization, incident analysis, AP=
I reviews)
2 product prompts (requirements extraction, competitive analysis)
2 sales prompts (pipeline risk assessment, discovery prep)
2 marketing prompts (content gap analysis, campaign briefs)
2 customer success prompts (account health assessment, onboarding plans)
1 operations prompt (budget variance analysis)
Real examples of the difference =E2=80=93 side-by-side comparisons showing =
why longer, context-rich prompts save 2-10 hours per week while generic tem=
plates waste time
Customization framework =E2=80=93 how to take these prompts and adapt them =
for your specific industry, process, and constraints
Implementation guidance =E2=80=93 what to do this week to start building wo=
rkflow-first AI into your team=E2=80=99s actual work
The continuous learning approach =E2=80=93 why AI education never ends and =
how to keep pace with exponential capability growth
Each prompt is built to solve a specific workflow problem where teams curre=
ntly waste hours grinding without results. They=E2=80=99re longer than Open=
AI=E2=80=99s templates because they can do more. They include your context,=
 your process, your constraints, and they=E2=80=99re designed to evolve as =
AI capabilities advance.
The difference between generic prompts and workflow-first prompts is the di=
fference between getting analysis you could have gotten from Google in 2019=
 and getting decisions you can act on today.
If you=E2=80=99re serious about AI adoption=E2=80=94not the checkbox kind, =
but the kind that actually transforms how your team works=E2=80=94this is f=
or you.
Let=E2=80=99s get into it.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
First, grab those 12 prompts for work here [ https://substack.com/redirect/=

f9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
TL;DR: I built 12 workflow-driven prompts as an alternative to OpenAI=E2=80=
=99s generic templates. Each one solves a specific pain point where teams w=
aste 2-10 hours per week: engineering (technical debt prioritization, incid=
ent analysis, API reviews), product (requirements extraction, competitive a=
nalysis), sales (pipeline risk assessment, discovery prep), marketing (cont=
ent gaps, campaign briefs), customer success (account health, onboarding pl=
ans), and operations (budget variance analysis).=20
They=E2=80=99re longer than OpenAI=E2=80=99s prompts because they can do mo=
re=E2=80=94they include your context, your process, your constraints, and t=
hey=E2=80=99re built to evolve as AI capabilities advance. The difference: =
OpenAI=E2=80=99s prompts give you what Google could provide in 2019. These =
give you decisions you can act on today.
And yes, they=E2=80=99re in Notion because that makes copy-and-paste much m=
uch easier than either Substack or Google Docs. Thanks Notion!
OpenAI Released 200 Prompt Templates. Here=E2=80=99s Why They Won=E2=80=99t=
 Work=E2=80=94And What Will.
OpenAI just released a prompt pack for enterprise teams [ https://substack.=

dzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. It is bad. It is basically a =
bunch of 2 sentence questions anyone could yeet into Google.

ngineering section. I picked it because it is for technical stakeholders. S=
arcasm intended.
Look at what=E2=80=99s missing here. There=E2=80=99s no data schema=E2=80=
=94what types of user data are we even talking about? Email addresses? Heal=
th records? Payment information? The compliance requirements are completely=
 different for each type.
=E2=80=9CEU and US=E2=80=9D doesn=E2=80=99t mean anything specific. Which E=
U countries? Which US states? California has CCPA. Virginia has VCDPA. Colo=
rado has CPA. Each one=E2=80=99s different. And in the EU, you need to know=
 which data protection authority has jurisdiction.
There=E2=80=99s nothing about your current stack. Are you on AWS? GCP? Azur=
e? What=E2=80=99s your data retention policy look like today? How do you ha=
ndle deletion requests? Where are the actual gaps?
No mention of processing activities. What do you actually DO with this data=
? Because using it for analytics versus marketing versus product features=
=E2=80=94those all have different legal implications.
And there=E2=80=99s no risk prioritization. Which compliance gaps could res=
ult in fines? Which are just nice-to-haves? What=E2=80=99s the difference b=
etween a must-fix and something you can address later?
When has engineering ever kicked off discussions with legal? And when did w=
e need AI to give us a checklist with citations? That=E2=80=99s what Google=
 is for. That=E2=80=99s not what intelligence is for.
Here=E2=80=99s why this matters to me:
This is AI education treated as one-and-done software adoption. Download th=
e template pack, roll it out to your teams, tick the box, move on. You=E2=
=80=99re done with AI training. AI is actually MUCH better than this, but t=
hese prompts would never give you that idea.
TLDR: AI isn=E2=80=99t software you learn once and use for years. It=E2=80=
=99s exponential technology on a moving train.
As an example, Sonnet 4.5 just did 30 hours of continuous coding and rebuil=
t Slack in one session=E2=80=9411,000 lines of working code. I took a scree=
nshot of a financial report last night and it generated a complete Excel mo=
del with formulas, formatting, and insights. Thirty minutes of work in thir=
ty seconds.
I tried the same thing with ChatGPT-5. It failed.
That was last night. By the time you=E2=80=99re reading this, there will un=
doubtedly be new capabilities neither of us knows about yet (something some=
thing Sora 2).
Your =E2=80=9CAI training=E2=80=9D from six months ago? Already obsolete. T=
he capabilities you don=E2=80=99t know about are doubling every few months.=
 That=E2=80=99s not me being dramatic=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s the actual pac=
e of model releases, feature launches, capability expansions happening righ=
t now.
Teams that think they=E2=80=99ve =E2=80=9Cadopted AI=E2=80=9D with template=
 prompts are going to wake up in 2026 wondering why they=E2=80=99re left be=
hind. They=E2=80=99ll be surprised when people come along and say =E2=80=9C=
I one-shotted an entire financial analysis=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CI automated=
 15 hours of pipeline review work.=E2=80=9D
This is my biggest fear for 2026: a generation of knowledge workers trapped=
 in the messy middle of AI adoption. They use ChatGPT for emails. They thin=
k they =E2=80=9Cknow AI.=E2=80=9D Meanwhile, they=E2=80=99re sitting on cap=
ability they don=E2=80=99t know exists, missing 80-90% of the AI opportunit=
y in their work.
And I see this everywhere I look. Teams using AI for summaries and email dr=
afts while their engineers spend 4 hours on code reviews that AI could comp=
ress to 45 minutes. Sales teams making gut-based pipeline calls when AI cou=
ld give them risk-scored recommendations with historical pattern matching. =
Product teams spending 8 hours extracting requirements from stakeholder cha=
os when AI could structure it in 90 minutes.
The capability is already there. The understanding isn=E2=80=99t.
What Actually Works
I=E2=80=99ve been thinking about this differently. Instead of starting with=
 =E2=80=9Chow do we use AI?=E2=80=9D, I start with =E2=80=9Cwhere are we wa=
sting time grinding without results?=E2=80=9D
Because that=E2=80=99s where the real opportunity is.
Your sales team spends 80 minutes every week on pipeline reviews that are s=
till guesswork. Your engineers spend 4 hours per code review catching the s=
ame issues over and over. Your product team spends 8 hours turning messy st=
akeholder input into clean requirements.
That=E2=80=99s where you start. Not with AI capabilities. With the pain poi=
nts where people are burning hours and still not confident in the results.
Let me show you what I mean with that sales pipeline review.
Here=E2=80=99s what it looks like today:
You pull the CRM data=E2=80=9415 minutes of exporting from Salesforce, wran=
gling fields, making sure deal stages are current, checking that close date=
s aren=E2=80=99t sitting there from three months ago. Just cleaning the dat=
a so you can actually work with it.
Then you build Excel pivots=E2=80=9420 minutes creating the views you need.=
 Pivot by stage. Pivot by rep. Pivot by close date. Format it so leadership=
 can read it. Make sure the numbers add up.
Then comes the hard part: 30 minutes staring at numbers trying to find patt=
erns. Which deals are stalled? Which reps are behind? Where=E2=80=99s the r=
isk? This is where you=E2=80=99re supposed to be strategic, but you=E2=80=
=99re mostly just tired from data wrangling. So you rely on gut feel and ho=
pe you=E2=80=99re not missing something obvious.
You make your calls=E2=80=945 minutes flagging the deals that feel risky. Y=
ou hope you=E2=80=99re right. You know you=E2=80=99re probably missing some=
thing because you can=E2=80=99t see patterns across 50 deals in your head.
Then you write the update email=E2=80=9410 minutes summarizing what you fou=
nd, trying to sound confident about calls you=E2=80=99re not actually confi=
dent about. You send it to leadership and hope the deals you flagged as ris=
ky are actually risky.
Total: 80 minutes of work. Low confidence in the result.
Here=E2=80=99s what it could look like:
The data pull is automated=E2=80=94script runs every Monday morning. Pulls =
fresh data, cleans the fields, flags issues. It=E2=80=99s ready before you =
start.
AI does the risk analysis in 2 minutes. You feed it the data along with you=
r historical close patterns. It analyzes activity levels, last contact date=
s, stage duration, stakeholder coverage. It calculates risk scores based on=
 what actually predicts deal slippage in your pipeline, not generic best pr=
actices.
You spend 5 minutes reviewing the scored recommendations. Looking at the AI=
=E2=80=99s risk assessment. Reading its reasoning. Checking if it makes sen=
se against what you know about these deals. You override if you have contex=
t it doesn=E2=80=99t. But now you=E2=80=99re reviewing recommendations, not=
 generating them from scratch.
AI drafts the update in 30 seconds. You ask it to write the email using its=
 analysis. It includes specific risk factors, quantified probabilities, rec=
ommended actions. You edit for tone and add any human context. Done.
Total: 8 minutes. High confidence.
And here=E2=80=99s what matters: The AI can see patterns across all 50 deal=
s simultaneously. It can compare this month to the last 12 months. It can i=
dentify that deals with no activity in 14 days and only one stakeholder eng=
aged have an 80% slip rate in your specific pipeline. Not because some best=
 practice guide says so=E2=80=94because that=E2=80=99s what your actual dat=
a shows.
That=E2=80=99s workflow-first prompting.
Not =E2=80=9Cuse this template.=E2=80=9D But =E2=80=9Csolve this specific p=
roblem in your actual work process.=E2=80=9D
The prompt you build will be longer than OpenAI=E2=80=99s templates. Good. =
That=E2=80=99s because it can do more. It has your context, your process, y=
our constraints, your decision criteria. It knows what =E2=80=9Cat risk=E2=
=80=9D actually means in your pipeline based on your historical data, not g=
eneric industry benchmarks.
And it evolves. When new AI capabilities launch next month, you test them a=
gainst your workflow. You refine your prompts. You keep learning because th=
e technology keeps advancing.
This isn=E2=80=99t training. This is capability building.
And here=E2=80=99s the thing=E2=80=94even if you=E2=80=99re stuck with Copi=
lot in your org (and by the way, Claude is now in the Office family, that=
=E2=80=99s why Microsoft=E2=80=99s been bragging about =E2=80=9Cthe best Ex=
cel model=E2=80=9D), you can still solve real problems with this approach. =
The gap isn=E2=80=99t the model. The gap is knowing how to use it for your =
actual work.
I Built 12 Examples
So I built 12 prompts using this workflow-first approach. Let me show you w=
hat they look like.
For Engineering:
Technical debt prioritization=E2=80=94not =E2=80=9Cresearch best practices,=
=E2=80=9D but a structured framework that takes your backlog, your team cap=
acity, your roadmap, and gives you a prioritized plan with effort estimates=
 and business impact.
Root cause analysis for production incidents=E2=80=94not =E2=80=9Ccreate a =
checklist,=E2=80=9D but a systematic investigation that maps the timeline, =
identifies contributing factors, and produces prevention measures based on =
your specific system architecture.
API design review with standards compliance=E2=80=94not =E2=80=9Canalyze th=
is code,=E2=80=9D but a comprehensive evaluation against your team=E2=80=99=
s standards with specific fixes for each issue found.
Each one takes what used to be 4 hours of work down to about 45 minutes. An=
d gives you decisions, not just analysis.
For Sales:
Pipeline risk assessment with historical pattern matching=E2=80=94what I ju=
st described. Turns 80 minutes of guesswork into 8 minutes of data-driven d=
ecisions.
Discovery call prep from CRM data and company research=E2=80=94pulls everyt=
hing you know about an account, maps their stakeholders, predicts objection=
s, and gives you a structured call plan. Takes 45 minutes of prep down to 1=
0.
Deal prioritization with coverage analysis=E2=80=94looks at your entire pip=
eline, identifies where you=E2=80=99re missing stakeholders, where engageme=
nt is low, where deals are likely to slip. Tells you where to focus your ti=
me.
Each one turns guesswork into data. Saves hours per week. Actually helps yo=
u close deals.
For Product:
Requirements extraction from messy stakeholder conversations=E2=80=94takes =
the chaos of meeting notes, Slack messages, email threads, customer feedbac=
k, and gives you structured user stories with acceptance criteria. Eight ho=
urs of work down to 90 minutes.
Competitive analysis with strategic gap identification=E2=80=94not just =E2=
=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s what competitors have,=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Chere=E2=
=80=99s where you=E2=80=99re behind, here=E2=80=99s where you=E2=80=99re ah=
ead, here=E2=80=99s what to build next and why.=E2=80=9D
Feature prioritization with quantified business impact=E2=80=94scores your =
backlog by actual impact, not opinion. Ties each feature to revenue, retent=
ion, or strategic goals with numbers.
Each one solves the broken telephone problem. Turns chaos into clarity.
For Marketing:
Content performance analysis with specific optimization actions=E2=80=94loo=
ks at what=E2=80=99s working, what=E2=80=99s not, and tells you exactly wha=
t to fix. Not =E2=80=9Cwrite more content,=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Cupdate the=
se 5 pieces, retire these 3, create these 2 new ones.=E2=80=9D
Campaign brief development from business goals=E2=80=94takes your high-leve=
l objectives and creates an executable campaign plan with channels, tactics=
, budget allocation, and success metrics.
Gap identification with audience-mapped opportunities=E2=80=94shows you wha=
t content you=E2=80=99re missing for each stage of the buyer journey and ea=
ch persona. Prioritized by impact.
Each one stops you from creating content nobody needs. Shows you what actua=
lly moves metrics.
For Customer Success:
Account health assessment with churn prediction=E2=80=94scores every accoun=
t by risk level, tells you specifically what=E2=80=99s going wrong, gives y=
ou actions to take before they churn.
Onboarding plans with 90-day success milestones=E2=80=94customized onboardi=
ng for each customer based on their goals, with specific milestones and suc=
cess criteria.
Expansion opportunity identification with revenue potential=E2=80=94finds t=
he accounts ready to expand, quantifies the opportunity, tells you exactly =
what to pitch.
Each one catches problems before they become churn. Finds revenue you=E2=80=
=99re leaving on the table.
For Operations:
Budget variance analysis with corrective action plans=E2=80=94looks at wher=
e you=E2=80=99re over or under budget, explains why, and gives you specific=
 actions to get back on track. Three hours of analysis down to 30 minutes.
That=E2=80=99s 12 prompts. Each one solves a specific workflow problem. Eac=
h one saves 2-10 hours per week. Each one includes context, format, constra=
ints, and edge case handling. Each one is built to evolve as AI capabilitie=
s advance.
Here=E2=80=99s the difference between generic and workflow-first:
Not this: =E2=80=9CAnalyze our sales pipeline and provide insights.=E2=80=
=9D
But this: =E2=80=9CYou are a sales operations analyst conducting pipeline h=
ealth analysis. Analyze the data below. For each deal: calculate risk score=
 based on activity patterns, last contact date, stage duration, and stakeho=
lder coverage. Flag high-risk deals with specific next actions. Prioritize =
by (deal size =C3=97 close probability) =C3=B7 days remaining. Output forma=
t: [specific table structure with risk factors, recommended actions, and fo=
recast adjustments]. If data is incomplete: state exactly what=E2=80=99s mi=
ssing and why it matters for the forecast.=E2=80=9D
One gives you generic analysis you could have gotten from a business analys=
t in 2019. The other gives you decisions you can act on today.
The first one is short because it does less. The second one is longer becau=
se it can do more.
Here=E2=80=99s What I=E2=80=99d Do
If I were starting this today, here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99d do this week=
:
Pick one workflow that wastes 2+ hours per week. Just one. Map it out step =
by step=E2=80=94what actually happens today? Where does information come fr=
om? Where does it go? What decisions get made? Where do you get stuck?
Then identify where AI actually helps. Not everywhere=E2=80=94be specific. =
Is it in the data gathering? The pattern recognition? The first draft of th=
e output? The decision support?
Build a prompt for your specific process. Not a generic template. A prompt =
that knows your context, your constraints, your decision criteria.
Test it with three real scenarios. Not invented examples. Actual work from =
last week.
Refine it based on what you see. What=E2=80=99s missing? What=E2=80=99s wro=
ng? What needs more context?
Measure the time saved. You=E2=80=99ll know within a week if this is workin=
g.
That=E2=80=99s workflow-first AI education.
Then if you want to see how I did this, get the 12 prompts I built. They=E2=
=80=99re not templates to copy-paste blindly. They=E2=80=99re examples of w=
orkflow-first prompting that you customize for your context.
Each one includes the specific pain point it solves, the workflow it integr=
ates with, customization points marked [LIKE THIS], success metrics so you =
know it=E2=80=99s working, and implementation guidance for your team.
You take the prompt. You fill in the [BRACKETS] with your industry, your pr=
ocess, your constraints. You test it. You refine it. You measure impact.
And I=E2=80=99ll keep updating these. New AI capabilities launch constantly=
=E2=80=94Sonnet 4.5=E2=80=99s image analysis, GPT=E2=80=99s reasoning impro=
vements, tool use, computer control, analysis features.
I test them. I update the prompts when new capabilities make them better. I=
 share what works.
Because this isn=E2=80=99t one-and-done. This is continuous learning to kee=
p pace with exponential technology.
The Choice
Look, I see two paths here.
Path 1: Roll out OpenAI=E2=80=99s template prompts. Think you=E2=80=99re do=
ne with AI training. Fall behind as capabilities advance. Wake up in 2026 w=
ondering why your team is struggling while others are 10x more productive.
Path 2: Build workflow-first prompts. Measure impact, not usage. Evolve con=
tinuously as AI advances. Stay on the moving train.
Most managers have no idea how much AI opportunity is sitting untouched in =
their teams. I see it everywhere I look=E2=80=9480-90% of the potential jus=
t sitting there because nobody knows it exists or how to use it.
You=E2=80=99re not using Copilot for emails and calling it AI adoption. You=
=E2=80=99re not asking ChatGPT to =E2=80=9Cresearch best practices.=E2=80=
=9D You=E2=80=99re building AI into your actual workflows where manual cycl=
es waste time without producing results.
The gap isn=E2=80=99t AI. The gap is people. The gap is people not being wi=
lling to train continuously. The gap is people thinking a little bit of tra=
ining is enough.
OpenAI released a prompt pack that says =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s your traini=
ng, you=E2=80=99re done.=E2=80=9D Reddit ripped it apart. The professionals=
 who are serious about AI rejected it immediately. They know what I know: i=
f you learn two or three lines in a prompt and think you=E2=80=99ve got it,=
 you=E2=80=99re already in the left-behind contingent.
We need better AI education. We need better understanding of where AI oppor=
tunities actually exist in our work. We need to retain our curiosity and le=
arn with AI as it scales.
And we=E2=80=99re not getting that from resources like OpenAI=E2=80=99s pro=
mpt pack.
So here=E2=80=99s my plea: If you=E2=80=99re a model maker, invest in real =
education. Clear on-ramps, yes. But also clear progression. Help people und=
erstand principles that scale with exponential technology.
And if you=E2=80=99re on a team trying to adopt AI: Start with pain points.=
 Build into workflows. Measure impact. Keep learning.
That=E2=80=99s how you do AI education right.
Built for professionals who refuse to treat exponential technology like lin=
ear software.

been watching teams waste their AI potential for months now, and it=E2=80=
=99s been frustrating. Not because people are lazy or uninterested=E2=80=94=
but because they=E2=80=99re being told that AI adoption is like rolling out=

en OpenAI released their enterprise prompt pack last week, I saw it as the =
perfect example of what=E2=80=99s going wrong with AI education. Two hundre=
d prompts that treat AI like it=E2=80=99s just better Google search. Generi=
c templates that miss the entire point of what this technology can do.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">So I built an alternative. Twelve workflow-driven prompts that =
show what happens when you start with the actual pain points in your work i=
nstead of starting with AI capabilities.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=

 a hit piece on OpenAI. They=E2=80=99re building incredible technology. But=
 someone needs to say clearly: if you think AI education is one-and-done, y=
ou=E2=80=99re going to wake up in 2026 wondering why you=E2=80=99re left be=
hind while others are 10x more productive.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I care about thi=
s because I see the gap. I work with teams that are sitting on 80-90% of un=
touched AI opportunity. They=E2=80=99re using ChatGPT for emails while thei=
r engineers grind through 4-hour code reviews and their sales teams make gu=
t-based pipeline calls. The capability is there. The understanding of how t=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

oad the template pack, roll it out to your teams, tick the box, move on. Yo=
u=E2=80=99re done with AI training. AI is actually MUCH better than this, b=

 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">TLDR: AI i=
sn=E2=80=99t software you learn once and use for years. It=E2=80=99s expone=
ntial technology on a moving train.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

.5 just did 30 hours of continuous coding and rebuilt Slack in one session=
=E2=80=9411,000 lines of working code. I took a screenshot of a financial r=
eport last night and it generated a complete Excel model with formulas, for=

aring at numbers trying to find patterns. Which deals are stalled? Which re=
ps are behind? Where=E2=80=99s the risk? This is where you=E2=80=99re suppo=
sed to be strategic, but you=E2=80=99re mostly just tired from data wrangli=

ment. Reading its reasoning. Checking if it makes sense against what you kn=
ow about these deals. You override if you have context it doesn=E2=80=99t. =
But now you=E2=80=99re reviewing recommendations, not generating them from =
scratch.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=

write the email using its analysis. It includes specific risk factors, quan=
tified probabilities, recommended actions. You edit for tone and add any hu=
man context. Done.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=

all 50 deals simultaneously. It can compare this month to the last 12 month=
s. It can identify that deals with no activity in 14 days and only one stak=
eholder engaged have an 80% slip rate in your specific pipeline. Not becaus=
e some best practice guide says so=E2=80=94because that=E2=80=99s what your=

ood. That=E2=80=99s because it can do more. It has your context, your proce=
ss, your constraints, your decision criteria. It knows what =E2=80=9Cat ris=
