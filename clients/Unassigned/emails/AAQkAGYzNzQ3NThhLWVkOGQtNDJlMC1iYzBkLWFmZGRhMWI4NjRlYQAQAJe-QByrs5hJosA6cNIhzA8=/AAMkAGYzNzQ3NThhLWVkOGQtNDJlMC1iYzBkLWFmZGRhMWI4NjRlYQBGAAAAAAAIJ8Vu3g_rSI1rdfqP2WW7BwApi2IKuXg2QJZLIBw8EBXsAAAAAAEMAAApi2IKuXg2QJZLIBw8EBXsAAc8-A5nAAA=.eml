What happens when you give a smart chatbot access to all your personal data=
?
Is it a nightmare? Is it brilliant? OpenAI is betting you will want to find=
 out.
Or more specifically, Sam Altman is betting your employer will want to make=
 sure all your work email and calendar and meeting notes get handled by a c=
hatbot=E2=80=94their chatbot. And Data Connectors is his play to do that.
No more Granola, no more Anthropic. No more Otter. At least=E2=80=94that=E2=
=80=99s their vision. Welcome to the data wars, Mad Max style.
We=E2=80=99re all here in the desert figuring out how to capture the most p=
recious resource in the world: data. This underlying ruthless competition i=
s what explains OpenAI=E2=80=99s move today, Anthropic=E2=80=99s move to cu=
t its models off from Windsurf, and the fears around how these moves will i=
mpact smaller players like Granola or Otter.
The common thread is that everyone believes that the players who grab the d=
ata will longterm win because they will be able to offer more sophisticated=
 reasoning across those data sets. And the open question is whether general=
 purpose models will ultimately deliver intelligence that beats single purp=
ose tools at these jobs. OpenAI is betting yes. Point solution companies ar=
e betting no.
This piece isn=E2=80=99t just about the competitive data wars though! It di=
ves into how the Data Connectors launch works in practice, where it shines =
and the (quite a few) places where there are rough edges. I give you practi=
cal tips on how to use it today and dive a bit deeper into the implications=
 of this shift in the competitive landscape for builders, founders, product=
 strategy, and all of us just sitting there in meetings wondering where our=
 data is going.

osts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.
OpenAI Data Connectors =E2=80=94 fast facts
What they are
Light-weight integrations that let ChatGPT pull live content from third-par=
ty or internal apps (e.g., Google Drive, Box, GitHub, SharePoint, Slack) an=
d inject it into the model=E2=80=99s context on-the-fly.
Two flavours
Pre-built connectors =E2=80=93 toggle-on links to common SaaS drives and co=
de repos.
Custom connectors =E2=80=93 organisations can expose any proprietary system=
 by standing up a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server; admins publish these=
 to their tenant=E2=80=99s connector list.
Where they live in the UI
Inside a chat, enable Deep Research, click the Connect tab, choose a source=
, and get going.
Plans & rollout status (June 2025)
Beta today for Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise & Edu.
Team/Enterprise admins decide which connectors are enabled; custom MCP conn=
ectors require admin deployment.
Free tier: not (yet) included.
Core use-cases they target
=E2=80=9CEveryday search=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 grab a paragraph or spreadsheet=
 row without leaving chat.
=E2=80=9CDeep research=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 multi-query retrieval across thou=
sands of docs with automatic citations.
Structured workflows =E2=80=93 combine with code-interpreter or function-ca=
lling to transform the fetched data.
Security & governance guard-rails
Access honours the source system=E2=80=99s ACLs; ChatGPT only sees what the=
 signed-in user could already read.
OAuth-based auth flow; no file copies unless you opt to =E2=80=9Csync & ind=
ex=E2=80=9D specific sources for faster recall.
Custom MCP connectors run on customer-controlled infrastructure.
Why it matters
Positions ChatGPT as a direct competitor to Microsoft Copilot=E2=80=99s Gra=
ph data access by closing the =E2=80=9Cmy files live elsewhere=E2=80=9D gap=
=2E
Drives stickier enterprise adoption: Box=E2=80=99s CEO calls it =E2=80=9Ca =
breakthrough new way to work with your enterprise unstructured data.=E2=80=
=9D
Limitations & gotchas (current beta)
Connector queries count against chat tokens; very large file sets may requi=
re advance indexing.
Only Deep-Research mode can chain multiple searches automatically; standard=
 chat does single-shot queries.
Admins must monitor MCP connectors for prompt-injection / data-leak risks.
What=E2=80=99s next
Public API for connectors is on the roadmap so external devs can call the s=
ame search endpoints.
Additional SaaS targets (SharePoint, OneDrive, Salesforce) are slated for l=
ate-2025 GA.
In Depth
OpenAI=E2=80=99s new Deep Research connectors, rolled out on June 4, feel l=
ess like a feature drop and more like the next chess-move in the long game =
to become the operating system of knowledge work. Overnight, Plus, Pro, and=
 Team subscribers gained one-click hooks into Google Drive, SharePoint, Dro=
pbox, Box, Outlook, Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Linear, HubSpot, and ev=
en custom sources via Model Context Protocol (MCP). What matters isn=E2=80=
=99t the length of that list=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the direction of travel. =
Each connector removes another =E2=80=9Cair-gap=E2=80=9D between ChatGPT an=
d the living, breathing exhaust of corporate life. In practical terms, Open=
AI just positioned itself to sit in the same data stream your productivity =
suite has enjoyed for a decade, with full intent to index, reason over, and=
 eventually automate the workflows that live there.
If the move feels familiar, it should. Anthropic walked the same path last =
month, lighting up Gmail, Calendar, and Docs inside Claude and pairing that=
 with a Research agent that scours the open web. The message from both camp=
s is unambiguous: whoever owns the retrieval plane will dictate the future =
of AI-augmented work. Connectors are less about delightful features and mor=
e about creating a lock on proprietary context=E2=80=94an arms-race for tok=
ens in. That race is intensifying because high-quality private data remain =
the scarcest=E2=80=94therefore most defensible=E2=80=94fuel for model impro=
vement.
Yet when I stress-tested OpenAI=E2=80=99s connectors the honeymoon ended fa=
st. Deep Research capped each API call at roughly 15 objects=E2=80=94e-mail=
s, calendar events, or docs=E2=80=94then tried to pass off fuzzy extrapolat=
ions as =E2=80=9Canalysis.=E2=80=9D Ask for a 100-message cohort study of l=
ast month=E2=80=99s inbox and it waves in the general direction of the trut=
h while quoting numbers that anyone who actually receives those e-mails kno=
ws are fantasy. The bandwidth simply isn=E2=80=99t there; the model=E2=80=
=99s reasoning graph collapses once the retrieval layer throttles. In short=
, connectors promise breadth, but the pipes are garden-hose thin.
Let me show you how thin:
The technical reason is prosaic but revealing: every object that flows thro=
ugh Deep Research must be serialized, embedded, and scored inside a single =
conversation window, where token costs compound brutally. OpenAI is rationi=
ng I/O today so it can observe usage, refine ranking heuristics, and=E2=80=
=94crucially=E2=80=94collect alignment data on where the assistant stumbles=
=2E The 15-object ceiling isn=E2=80=99t=
 a bug; it=E2=80=99s a throttle while=20=
they harvest implicit feedback loops (clicks, rewrites, follow-ups) to trai=
n a future retrieval stack that won=E2=80=99t melt the cost curve.
Even within those constraints, I found a sweet spot: tightly scoped, keywor=
d-anchored tasks shine. Give the assistant a single upcoming webinar title =
and it stitches together agenda e-mails, calendar holds, prep docs, and pub=
lic web chatter into a coherent brief that would cost me half an hour by ha=
nd. The difference is precision. A narrow query lowers the recall burden, k=
eeps token spend manageable, and lets o3=E2=80=99s reasoning muscle triangu=
late across a dozen shards without hallucinating gaps. I actually got a ver=
y usable event report!=20
Bottom line: Connectors are scalpels, not chainsaws; treat them accordingly=
 and they start to look useful.
Strategically, this launch doubles as a massive training-data siphon. The M=
CP endpoint makes it trivial for enterprises to pump bespoke datasets direc=
tly into ChatGPT while retaining individualized privacy (OpenAI=E2=80=99s p=
olicy lets them learn from larger patterns so long as logs are aggregated, =
which doesn=E2=80=99t jeopardize individual data points while allowing Open=
AI to learn).=20
Meanwhile Anthropic is playing data wars too. It quietly blocked 1st party =
access to its models from Windsurf=E2=80=94recently acquired by OpenAI=E2=
=80=94for exactly the same reason: starve the rival of fresh data. If you=
=E2=80=99re building vertical AI products, assume the model makers will plu=
g any readily available data hose themselves; your moat must be in domains =
where that hose is sealed tight=E2=80=94regulatory data silos, proprietary =
sensor feeds, or workflows with idiosyncratic ontologies.
The launch also reminds me of Operator=E2=80=99s rocky debut back in Januar=
y. That shopping agent was borderline unusable until OpenAI swapped in o3, =
trimmed latency, and quietly tuned its browsing policy. Six months later it=
=E2=80=99s ten times faster and genuinely handy for travel planning. I expe=
ct the connector stack to follow the same curve: rough now, respectable by =
Q4 once usage telemetry hardens the retrieval model and the 15-object limit=
 loosens.
All of which elevates an unsexy but vital skill for 2026: precision prompti=
ng married to information hygiene. Most corporate wikis, CRMs, and ticket q=
ueues are total junkyards; if you lob an open-ended request into that mess,=
 the assistant will mirror the chaos back at you. It=E2=80=99s like looking=
 at a dump through a straw.=20
The onus shifts to humans to carve out crisp, bounded questions and, when p=
ossible, maintain cleaner metadata so retrieval costs don=E2=80=99t drown t=
he reasoning layer. The better we get at recognizing that AI is more powerf=
ul when it drinks cleaner data, the better off we=E2=80=99re gonna be.
Bottom line: Connectors are not the finished product=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99r=
e beachheads. Today they struggle beyond toy-sized slices of data, but the =
trajectory is obvious. Over the next two release cycles OpenAI will widen t=
he pipe, Anthropic will counter-punch, and the real differentiator will bec=
ome the quality of your proprietary context and the sharpness of your queri=
es. Start curating both now, because the models are hungry and the enterpri=
se OS is up for grabs.
Competitive tremors for the =E2=80=9Csingle-stream=E2=80=9D specialists
Point players such as Granola, Otter.ai, Fireflies, Fathom, and Grain have =
thrived by owning one well-scoped content firehose=E2=80=94usually meeting =
audio=E2=80=94and wrapping it in UX that feels tailor-made for sales calls,=
 user-research interviews, or recruiting screens.=20
Granola, for example, pipes system-level Mac audio straight into a local ve=
ctor store, avoiding intrusive bots and pushing out instant summaries and s=
hare links. Venture money still loves that thesis: Granola closed a $43 mil=
lion round three weeks ago, and Fathom raised $17 million last September to=
 =E2=80=9Ccentralize meeting intelligence.=E2=80=9D=20
Fireflies, meanwhile, is building =E2=80=9Cmini-apps=E2=80=9D that mine tra=
nscripts for revenue risks or hiring signals. In other words, the vertical =
specialists continue to get funded because they promise depth=E2=80=94 besp=
oke downstream workflows=E2=80=94while the platforms aim for breadth.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s connectors shift the ground under those feet in two ways. =
First, they commoditize basic capture and retrieval: once ChatGPT can inges=
t a Teams recording or Zoom transcript through its own meeting recorder, tr=
anscription accuracy and keyword search cease to be differentiators.=20
Second, they reset user expectations around price-to-value. If Plus already=
 gives me =E2=80=9Cgood-enough=E2=80=9D meeting notes bundled with my email=
, calendar, and docs search, a stand-alone $20-per-seat note-taker starts t=
o feel like a premium latte=E2=80=94justifiable only if it delivers artisan=
al insights I can=E2=80=99t get elsewhere. For the founders behind these to=
ols, the moat has to move up-stack from =E2=80=9Cwe transcribe=E2=80=9D to =
=E2=80=9Cwe help you win deals, ship the right feature, or reduce churn by =
5%.=E2=80=9D That focus on outcomes need to define the next generation of s=
tartups (or the pivots these builders are about to make).
But! Releases like this do not spell automatic extinction. The brute-force =
retrieval limits we just hit=E2=80=9415 objects per call=E2=80=94show that =
horizontal platforms will bleed precision whenever context balloons or doma=
in nuance matters. Meeting-intelligence vendors can exploit that gap by shi=
pping vertical =E2=80=9Creasoning modules=E2=80=9D that already speak CRM s=
chema, research tagging taxonomies, or compliance codes.=20
Fireflies=E2=80=99 mini-apps are exactly that play: micro-agents fine-tuned=
 on sales or hiring language, riding the transcript substrate its core app =
collects. Likewise, Granola=E2=80=99s ability to keep raw audio on-device a=
nd only surface structured notes can satisfy privacy officers who balk at u=
ploading PII-laden calls to ChatGPT=E2=80=99s servers=E2=80=94a differentia=
tor that grows more valuable as regulators close in on cross-border data tr=
ansfers.
Finally, the distribution surface itself may flip from threat to channel. B=
ig-model vendors still lack enterprise-grade vertical workflows; they=E2=80=
=99d rather partner or acquire than rebuild nuanced dashboards for pipeline=
 health or UX pain-point mining. A connector layer like OpenAI launched tod=
ay via MCP normalizes authentication and permissions also lowers the fricti=
on for point players to embed their speciality inside ChatGPT (or Claude) w=
ith a single OAuth handshake.=20
If your product can prove incremental lift=E2=80=94say, turning generic tra=
nscripts into actionable win-loss analysis=E2=80=94OpenAI becomes less a co=
mpetitor and more the world=E2=80=99s biggest app store. The strategic nort=
h star, then, is to own a feedback-rich loop that platforms are structurall=
y bad at: domain-specific labels, curated benchmark datasets, or human-in-t=
he-loop corrections that continually harden your private model.
In short, connectors nudge the market toward a barbell structure: broad, lo=
w-margin capture at the base layer, and high-context, decision-grade analyt=
ics at the top. Point solutions that cling to middle-layer commodity functi=
ons will get squeezed. Those that climb the stack=E2=80=94embedding themsel=
ves in revenue ops, product discovery, or regulated-data workflows=E2=80=94=
still have plenty of oxygen. The next 12 months will reveal which camp each=
 =E2=80=9CAI notepad=E2=80=9D actually belongs to.
Where the rich data pockets still hide
The connectors land-grab hoovers up =E2=80=9Ccorporate exhaust=E2=80=9D=E2=
=80=94e-mail, calendars, cloud docs, meetings, tickets=E2=80=94because that=
 exhaust is already in SaaS pipes with OAuth gates OpenAI can snap onto. Bu=
t vast seams of high-value data remain stubbornly off-grid:
Operational telemetry and OT/IoT streams. Industrial PLC logs, building-man=
agement sensors, energy SCADA feeds, factory MES traces, even the vibration=
 spectra coming off wind turbines sit on air-gapped networks or vendor-lock=
ed HMIs. They=E2=80=99re time-series torrents measured in megahertz, not pl=
ain text, and they swim in proprietary binary payloads. Mapping that teleme=
try into feature space=E2=80=94and aligning it with business context=E2=80=
=94requires ground-truth labelling, domain expertise, and often a truck rol=
l. Those frictions put a moat around anyone who can capture, cleanse, and s=
erve it up as embeddings.
Life-science and clinical archives. Genomic FASTQ files, proteomic mass-spe=
c outputs, radiology DICOM stacks, and longitudinal EHR tables live behind =
HIPAA walls or FDA-validated LIMS. The data are both petabyte-scale and pat=
ient-specific, so cloud LLMs can=E2=80=99t simply hoover them up without a =
BAA, rigorous de-identification, and predicate-rule traceability. Startups =
that specialize in harmonizing these modalities=E2=80=94think foundation mo=
dels for 3-D protein folds or multi-modal pathology slide viewers=E2=80=94o=
perate in a canyon that=E2=80=99s unattractive for horizontal players but r=
ich for specialists.
Mission-critical finance ledgers. Core banking systems, post-trade FIX logs=
, brokerage order books, and private credit deal rooms run on mainframes or=
 sealed VPCs under SOX/GLBA regimes. The data schema reflect decades of acc=
reted business logic, and leakage risk is existential. Anyone who can insta=
ll low-latency inference at the colocation edge=E2=80=94auditing trades in =
real time or flagging emerging liquidity crunches=E2=80=94owns a wedge big =
models can=E2=80=99t replicate without a chartered bank=E2=80=99s blessing.
Geospatial and built-world captures. LiDAR point clouds, BIM/REVIT project =
files, 4-K drone photogrammetry, satellite SAR rasters=E2=80=94these are mu=
lti-gigabyte artefacts that encode the physical world at centimetre resolut=
ion. They require specialized spatial indexes, 3-D voxel grids, and domain =
ontologies (IFC, CityGML) few LLM providers have on tap. AEC and climate-ri=
sk platforms that fuse this data with regulatory overlays are surfing a vei=
n that stays inaccessible to generic connectors.
Regulated comms and encrypted back-channels. Whatsapp chats between bankers=
, Signal DMs inside activist movements, or the on-prem Mattermost instance =
a defense contractor runs behind a zero-trust firewall remain opaque to Saa=
S APIs. Governance mandates (FINRA 17a-4, ITAR) forbid third-party ingestio=
n. Companies building =E2=80=9Csovereign AI=E2=80=9D modules that run entir=
ely in the customer=E2=80=99s enclave=E2=80=94logging, decrypting, and anal=
ysing in situ=E2=80=94can still carve out defensible turf.
There are others too.
Bottom line: if the data stream needs proprietary codecs, lives in a high-f=
riction trust boundary, or demands multimodal fusion beyond text, it=E2=80=
=99s still fertile ground for vertical specialists. The play is own capture=
 and labelling at the edge, then lease distilled embeddings=E2=80=94never r=
aw data=E2=80=94up-stack to whichever foundation model wins the cloud war. =
The value proposition for customers is simple: trust us with the data, and =
we give you the smartest signal, whether you get it from us directly or fro=
m big players that use our aggregators and connectors.
Data wars: Claude vs. ChatGPT, and why Windsurf was collateral damage
This deserves more attention than it got.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s connector push isn=E2=80=99t just a product sprint=E2=80=
=94it=E2=80=99s a token-harvesting campaign that collides head-on with Anth=
ropic=E2=80=99s own appetite for private data. Tensions surfaced visibly af=
ter OpenAI moved to acquire Windsurf (f.k.a. Codeium) for ~$3 billion in ea=
rly May. Almost immediately, Anthropic slashed Windsurf=E2=80=99s first-par=
ty capacity to Claude 3.x, forcing the IDE to scramble for third-party BYOK=
 work-arounds and choking a data channel that would soon be owned by its ri=
val.
The episode lays bare a new norm: model vendors will weaponize access to th=
eir inference endpoints whenever a downstream application threatens to enri=
ch a competitor=E2=80=99s training corpus. Anthropic=E2=80=99s earlier head=
line move=E2=80=94integrating Gmail, Drive, and Calendar before OpenAI=E2=
=80=94was itself a defensive stroke to lock in workspace data. Now OpenAI=
=E2=80=99s MCP-powered connectors reciprocate, encouraging enterprises to s=
hip proprietary context straight into ChatGPT=E2=80=99s orbit and undercutt=
ing one of Claude 4=E2=80=99s key advantages (which I wrote about here [ ht=
tps://substack.com/redirect/cfa81780-3041-4b4d-b6ce-4786c9acf500?j=3DeyJ1Ij=
oiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]).
Expect the skirmish to escalate on three fronts:
Exclusive licensing and M&A. More Reddit-style data-licence deals, more str=
ategic acqui-hires of workflow hubs (Windsurf today, maybe an agentic CRM t=
omorrow) as each camp amasses content pipelines the other can=E2=80=99t leg=
ally crawl.
API throttling and rev-share renegotiations. Third-party tools that depend =
on Claude or GPT endpoints will find rate limits, price hikes, or outright =
ejections if their usage patterns pump valuable logs into the wrong data la=
ke.
Ecosystem loyalty tests. Enterprise buyers will be nudged to pick a side: p=
ay for Claude apps and keep data in the Anthropic garden, or standardize on=
 ChatGPT Team/Enterprise and enjoy a single retrieval pane across mail, mee=
tings, and docs.
For builders the implication is stark: data sovereignty is strategic high g=
round. If your product=E2=80=99s value derives from ingesting irreplaceable=
, high-signal context, protect that supply line=E2=80=94technically (on-pre=
m, enclave compute) and contractually (mutual NDAs, data-use carve-outs). T=
he foundation models will keep battling for raw tokens, but the most enduri=
ng businesses will be the ones sitting atop streams the giants simply can=
=E2=80=99t tap. Find that data!
