Yesterday, Bloomberg dropped Apple's grand AI strategy [ https://substack.c=

zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]: a tabletop robot for 2027. A "=
lifelike" Siri. Smart displays. Home security cameras.
By then, ChatGPT will be on version 7. Claude will have evolved through mul=
tiple generations. And Apple will ship... I=E2=80=99m betting they=E2=80=99=
ll ship a robot running yesterday's AI.
This should terrify you=E2=80=94not because Apple is failing, but because e=
verything Apple taught us about building products is now wrong.
For forty years, Apple didn't just make products. They trained an entire ge=
neration=E2=80=94you, me, every PM, every founder, every designer=E2=80=94i=
n the religion of perfection. Wait to ship until it's perfect. Control the =
full stack. Own the experience end-to-end. Eliminate complexity. The custom=
er doesn't know what they want until you show them.
Sure, we heard about Y Combinator, Paul Graham, =E2=80=9Cship fast and brea=
k things=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94but in the back of all our heads loomed the expec=
tation of Cupertino, and that obsession with quality got more and more impo=
rtant the more scaled our companies got. Breaking things was for small comp=
anies, and even Facebook outgrew it.
So these weren't just Apple's principles. They became our principles. The i=
nvisible assumptions behind every product decision we make. The voice in ou=
r heads saying "would Apple ship this?" or more realistically =E2=80=9Cwow =
this kind of sucks is it close enough to the quality bar that it will be ok=
?=E2=80=9D
That instinct to lean into deterministic quality is now trying to kill your=
 company, and it=E2=80=99s not because quality is bad!
Here's what nobody's saying clearly: Apple isn't randomly failing at AI. Th=
ey're failing in a highly specific pattern that reveals exactly which assum=
ptions you need to invert to succeed. Each of their failures maps to a rule=
 reversal=E2=80=94a place where the old wisdom doesn't just fail, it fails =
catastrophically.
The products winning right now=E2=80=94ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney=E2=80=94=
violate every principle Apple taught us. They shipped broken. They let user=
s figure out use cases. They federate instead of integrate. They iterate in=
 public. They choose capability over polish, every single time.
But this isn't just another "Apple is behind" piece. We=E2=80=99ve had enou=
gh of those. This is a decoder ring for the new rules. Because if you're st=
ill following the playbook Apple wrote=E2=80=94perfectionism, secrecy, cont=
rol, curation=E2=80=94you're optimizing for failure. (And if you don=E2=80=
=99t think you are, I encourage you to listen in on a C-suite conversation =
sometime=E2=80=94so many of them highlight one or another of these qualitie=
s.) But those qualities won=E2=80=99t work anymore. Those same instincts th=
at would have made you successful in 2007 will bury you in 2025.
The 10 lessons I=E2=80=99ve constructed here aren't random observations. Th=
ey're the exact inversions happening right now=E2=80=94the places where you=
r Apple-trained instincts are betraying you, and what to do instead in the =
age of AI.
Your iPhone is becoming beautiful glass for accessing ChatGPT. The Mac is b=
ecoming a premium terminal for Claude. Apple is becoming what Jobs despised=
 most: expensive infrastructure for other people's intelligence.
Let me show you exactly why the company that perfected the art of technolog=
y can't ship AI=E2=80=94and the specific inversions you need to make to bui=
ld anything that matters in the age of intelligence.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
The Priesthood and the Prompt: Why Apple Can't Win the AI War
The News
This week, Bloomberg reported Apple's grand AI strategy: a tabletop robot c=
ompanion for 2027, featuring a "lifelike" Siri powered by large language mo=
dels. Pardon me while I choke on my coffee here.=20
The company also announced plans for AI-powered smart displays and home sec=
urity cameras, with the unsurprising news that the new Siri integration del=
ayed another year=E2=80=94now arriving "next year at the earliest."
In the time it will likely take Apple to ship this robot, OpenAI will likel=
y release ChatGPT-5, GPT-6, and possibly GPT-7. Google's Gemini will be sev=
eral generations ahead. Anthropic will have evolved Claude through multiple=
 new iterations. The AI landscape of 2027 will make today's capabilities lo=
ok quaint.
Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence=E2=80=94announced with fanfare at WWDC=E2=80=
=94remains in "limited beta" eight months later, with features like Genmoji=
 and enhanced notifications trickling out to select users. Full availabilit=
y has been pushed to 2026. Tim Cook tells employees AI is "as big or bigger=
 than the internet," yet Apple's actual AI products remain perpetually on t=
he horizon.
The phrase that gives everything away appears in multiple reports: Apple is=
 taking a "measured approach." In an industry where OpenAI ships updates we=
ekly and Google iterates in public, "measured" has come to mean something d=
ifferent to me: a euphemism for something darker=E2=80=94structural paralys=
is.
The Cargo Cult
After years in AI, announcements read like messages from a parallel univers=
e where time moves differently. While Apple plans a 2027 robot, ChatGPT has=
 already reached ~800 million users, Microsoft has integrated AI across Off=
ice, and Google has rebuilt search around AI and has reached hundreds of mi=
llions of users themselves with Gemini. These companies measure progress in=
 weeks; Apple is planning in years.
The pattern is impossible to ignore. Every Apple AI announcement follows th=
e same trajectory: ambitious reveal, delayed timeline, limited rollout, fur=
ther delays, quiet scaling back of promises. Siri was going to become conve=
rsational years ago. The Vision Pro was going to revolutionize computing. N=
ow a robot in 2027 will finally crack the code. So they say.
This isn't just being behind=E2=80=94it's playing an entirely different gam=
e, perfecting yesterday's solutions while others define the terms for tomor=
row=E2=80=99s customer experiences.
The Surface Reading
The conventional analysis writes itself: Apple is "behind" in AI. While Mic=
rosoft integrated GPT into Office, while Google rebuilt search around AI, w=
hile OpenAI became a household name, Apple was still trying to make Siri un=
derstand compound sentences.
But this surface reading=E2=80=94Apple as merely slow=E2=80=94misses the de=
eper tragedy. This isn't a company that's failing to execute on the right s=
trategy. This is a company whose entire cultural DNA is optimized for a wor=
ld that no longer exists.
And that=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s interesting ot me. Because the lessons we=
 learn from Apple are the lessons all of us need to learn as we begin to di=
scover how companies (and products, and careers) are built in the age of AI=
=2E
Something Deeper: The Jobs Thesis=20
Let me suggest a reading of the Apple situation that=E2=80=99s deeper and m=
ore interesting. It requires us to go back in time a bit, so stay with me=
=E2=80=A6
Steve Jobs built Apple on a profound insight: computers were too powerful t=
o remain imprisoned by complexity. His solution was radical: take total con=
trol of the experience to paradoxically deliver more freedom to users. Don'=
t make them think about drivers, file systems, or compatibility. Just let t=
hem create.
This wasn't mere product strategy=E2=80=94it was theology. Jobs believed in=
 a technological priesthood where Apple's designers, through monastic dedic=
ation to simplicity, would intercede between users and complexity. The famo=
us "1000 nos for every yes" wasn't just focus; it was a belief that Apple p=
ossessed the wisdom to know what should exist.
This thesis created four pillars of Apple culture:
Perfection Before Permission: Never ask users what they want; show them wha=
t they didn't know they needed. Ship only when you've eliminated every fric=
tion point. This is where the obsession with chamfered edges comes from.
A Torus of Secrets: Yes, I had fun naming this one. Development happens in =
secret, integration beats modularity, control the atoms to perfect the bits=
=2E 1 Cupertino Way becomes an address=20=
where the smartest engineers work on s=
ecret projects for years at a time before finally revealing something aston=
ishing to the public (or that=E2=80=99s the dream).
Taste as Competitive Advantage: One person with perfect taste beats collect=
ive intelligence. Users don't know what's good until you show them. This wa=
s Steve. This was Jony Ive. It=E2=80=99s definitely not Tim Cook, who came =
from the hardware supply chain side of things.=20
Unit Economics as a Profit Driver: Every component is engineered for both p=
erfection and scale. Unit economics matter. Engineers obsess over manufactu=
rability as much as appearance. This is the foundation of Apple=E2=80=99s m=
argins and longterm corporate value.
Every assumption here breaks or transforms in the AI era.
First, the core insight: Intelligence is obviously useful in a way computer=
s weren=E2=80=99t.=20
Instead, intelligence is abundant but messy. Jobs' Apple was built to make =
scarce computing power with no obvious utility accessible through perfect i=
nterfaces. But AI flips this: today=E2=80=99s intelligence is so powerful t=
hat it is obviously useful. People will wrestle with terrible interfaces to=
 access it. ChatGPT launched with a bare text box. Nobody cared. It was too=
 useful.
Apple wasn=E2=80=99t built for a world where tech has that much obvious val=
ue.
Second, users are now teachers, not students. AI models learn from usage. E=
very prompt teaches. Apple's priesthood model=E2=80=94wisdom flowing one di=
rection from Cupertino=E2=80=94can't comprehend a world where products get =
smarter through interaction. Their instinct to perfect in private means mis=
sing the feedback loops that make AI useful.=20
And the longer Apple delays, the worse the problem gets.
Third, value emerges from collision, not curation. The breakthrough AI appl=
ications come from users doing things creators never imagined. ChatGPT for =
therapy, Claude for coding, Midjourney for architecture. Apple's "we know b=
est" culture would have prevented these use cases through over-curation.
Now, it=E2=80=99s still true that taste matters! I=E2=80=99ve written about=
 it often. But AI is empowering a new generation of taste-makers, and the p=
oint is they aren=E2=80=99t limited to the white halls of Cupertino. They=
=E2=80=99re everywhere and don=E2=80=99t even need to be hired at a big nam=
e to be high-taste (thanks to the power of AI).
Again, Apple loses here by insisting that they have a monopoly on AI taste =
while the world evolves past them.
Fourth, hardware leverage is now a function of Nvidia, not Foxconn. Yes, th=
ere=E2=80=99s still unit economics in AI, but the economics have flipped. I=
t=E2=80=99s no longer about perfecting a device to ship to hundreds of mill=
ions of people. It=E2=80=99s about scaling the delivery of bits via the eff=
icient deployment of gigantic data centers. And because the value is delive=
red via bits, the leverage in pricing comes from smarter tokens.
Fundamentally the equation has shifted from dollar cost averaging iPhone co=
mponents to figuring out the most efficient cost per intelligent token. Tha=
t is not a world a hardware company is ready to handle. And the more Apple =
insists on fitting AI into their existing form factors, the more they are f=
alling behind.
The River Runs Backward
Consider what users are tolerating right now to access AI:
Hallucinations and confident incorrectness
Daily model updates that break workflows
Copy-pasting between different chat interfaces
Multiple $20/month subscriptions
Inconsistent outputs requiring prompt engineering
Apple spent forty years teaching people to demand perfection. AI is unteach=
ing that lesson in real-time. The river that once flowed toward polish now =
rushes toward capability. Transformative-but-janky beats polished-but-incre=
mental, and Apple's DNA simply cannot ship transformative-but-janky.
Apple would never have shipped the original ChatGPT. Too many errors. Too m=
any edge cases. Too many ways for users to break it. Apple would have spent=
 three more years in a secret lab trying to eliminate hallucinations. And t=
he moment would have passed and we=E2=80=99d be talking about some other al=
ternate AI future timeline.
The Walled Garden is a Prison
But all this isn=E2=80=99t the whole story. Apple has another major problem=
: The multi-intelligence future is the real killer. We're rapidly heading t=
oward a world where you might want Claude for writing, GPT for coding, Gemi=
ni for research, Midjourney for images. Agents need to talk to other agents=
 across platforms. Open standards and interoperability become essential. Va=
lue comes from orchestration, not ownership.
Apple's entire ecosystem philosophy=E2=80=94everything works perfectly as l=
ong as you stay inside=E2=80=94becomes a liability when intelligence needs =
to flow freely between systems. Their instinct is to build "Apple Intellige=
nce" that only works with Apple products. That's like building a telephone =
that can only call other identical phones. (Yes, I realize this is literall=
y what they did with the blue iMessage=E2=80=94that only works because of A=
pple=E2=80=99s hardware footprint.)
The walled garden made sense when the challenge was making computers work r=
eliably. But intelligence wants to be federated. It wants to combine, recom=
bine, and transcend boundaries. Every wall Apple has built becomes a barrie=
r to intelligence flow. And that is turning Apple into a prison yard for in=
telligence.
Siri
Siri tells the whole story. Launched in 2011, it was ahead of the curve=E2=
=80=94the first mainstream voice assistant. By 2025, after fourteen years o=
f development, Apple is still trying to make it "conversational."
Why? Because Apple approached Siri as a command interface to perfect rather=
 than an intelligence to evolve. They focused on eliminating errors rather =
than expanding capabilities. They wanted predictable responses, not emergen=
t behaviors. They built a better button when the world wanted a conversatio=
n partner.=20
They followed Steve=E2=80=99s playbook for hardware computing with an intel=
ligence product, and it has been a disaster.
The 2027 robot repeats this error at spectacular scale. The AI already exis=
ts=E2=80=94GPT-5 Claude 4, Gemini (almost 3) are here now. While Apple desi=
gns hardware for 2027, competitors ship AI today and iterate hardware in pa=
rallel. Other AI labs experiment with hardware slowly while shipping softwa=
re weekly. By 2027, we'll be on ChatGPT-7 while Apple ships hardware as if =
that=E2=80=99s what matters now.
Cultural Antibodies in an AI World
We talk about getting to an AI culture a lot. I hear it from executives, fr=
om team leaders, from people at all levels in companies engaged in AI trans=
formation.
Apple is showing us the opposite: If most companies are trying to develop a=
nd evolve to fit the AI future, Apple is trying to force AI to conform to i=
ts own DNA.
Apple's culture now has antibodies against everything that makes AI work:
Against shipping beta: But AI needs public iteration to learn and improve.
Against messiness: But breakthrough capabilities come with rough edges that=
 users willingly tolerate.
Against openness: But intelligence wants to be federated across platforms a=
nd models.
Against admitting ignorance: But AI works best when exploring together with=
 users, not dictating from above (see Arxiv).
Against multiple paths: But AI users need to choose their own models and ap=
proaches for different tasks.
These antibodies were Apple's greatest strength as a hardware company. They=
 prevented feature creep, shoddy quality, and user confusion that plagued c=
ompetitors. They enabled the computing paradigm we use across tech today. B=
ut now they prevent Apple from participating authentically in the AI revolu=
tion.
Becoming the Wallpaper, Becoming IBM
The real existential risk isn't that Apple fails=E2=80=94it's that Apple be=
comes what Jobs fought against: the default wallpaper when real value is cr=
eated elsewhere.
Remember Windows before Satya? Technically competent, utterly unloved, pure=
 utility. Everyone had it, nobody was excited about it. Really after Satya =
we don=E2=80=99t talk about it either. We talk about Azure. Satya likes it =
that way. Windows the OS was just the thing you clicked through to get to t=
he real applications. As long as you bought it Bill Gates was happy. But th=
at won=E2=80=99t be enough at Apple.=20
This is Apple's trajectory: premium mediocrity. And Apple is programmed to =
have an existential crisis if they truly become mediocre. It=E2=80=99s so a=
ntithetical to the culture they have been taught to strive for.
The signs are already here. Safari is a perfect warning=E2=80=94it works, i=
t's private, it's efficient, and nobody loves it. It's the browser you use =
to download Chrome. The iPhone increasingly feels like really nice glass to=
 access ChatGPT through. The Mac is a premium terminal for cloud services, =
or a place a developer grabs Cursor and Claude Code to build with. There ar=
e even well-sourced rumors that that is exactly what Apple engineers do=E2=
=80=94the irony.
Value Runs Up the Stack
One of the very longterm trends in tech value and leverage is this: value r=
uns up the stack.
Value creation has migrated upwards for decades: Hardware =E2=86=92 OS =E2=
=86=92 Applications =E2=86=92 Intelligence. Each migration leaves unicorns =
dead in its wake and makes trillion dollar companies irrelevant. Now that w=
e have reached intelligence, Apple is the one at risk. They keep perfecting=
 lower layers while value moves to intelligence. They're making the world's=
 best CD player in the Spotify age (again, the irony).
The most damning metric? Where do the best AI researchers want to work? Not=
 Cupertino. Talent flows to OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, even Meta (for a p=
rice). Apple pays premium for second-tier AI talent. The priesthood can't a=
ttract new priests because the religion itself has become obsolete.
When did Apple last create genuine surprise? Users get their "wow" moments =
from ChatGPT responses, Claude's reasoning, Midjourney's images. Apple prov=
ides the screen; others provide the magic. The transition from "Apple annou=
nced..." excitement to "Apple responded..." exhaustion is complete.
The Historical Irony
The ultimate irony is breathtaking. Jobs built Apple to democratize computi=
ng through control. Perfect design would make computers accessible to every=
one. The priesthood would interpret the complexity so users could simply cr=
eate.
But AI is democratizing intelligence through chaos. Messy prompts, unpredic=
table outputs, experimental interfaces, public failures=E2=80=94everything =
Apple's culture rejects. Apple won by making computers human-friendly. AI w=
ins by making humans computer-friendly, teaching us to prompt, to iterate, =
to work with uncertainty.
Jobs loved the metaphor of the computer as "bicycle for the mind"=E2=80=94a=
 tool that amplifies human capability through elegant design. But AI isn't =
a bicycle. It's a conversational partner, a collective intelligence that ev=
olves through interaction. A bicycle is predictable, controlled, perfectibl=
e. AI is none of these things.
The Last Beautiful Product
Apple stands as the last great 20th-century technology company, perfecting =
bicycles while others build collective intelligence. The 2027 robot will li=
kely be beautiful, polished, and (in my view) likely irrelevant=E2=80=94a p=
erfect epitaph for a company that mastered the wrong century.
The question isn't whether Apple can catch up in AI. It's whether a company=
 built to eliminate complexity can survive when complexity is the feature. =
When mistakes are learning opportunities. When shipping broken products tha=
t transform the world beats shipping perfect products that don't.
The priesthood worked when users needed interpretation. But the age of prom=
pts doesn't need priests=E2=80=94it needs participants. Apple's measured ap=
proach, their careful curation, their methodical perfection=E2=80=94these a=
ren't bugs to be fixed. They're features of a cultural operating system inc=
ompatible with the current revolution.
The tragedy is that these very qualities made Apple great. The same DNA tha=
t created the iPhone now prevents them from competing in AI. The culture th=
at democratized computing can't democratize intelligence because intelligen=
ce doesn't want to be controlled=E2=80=94it wants to be free, federated, an=
d occasionally wrong.
Apple will likely remain profitable for years, even decades. IBM still exis=
ts. Microsoft survived missing mobile. But the center of gravity has shifte=
d. The magic happens elsewhere now. Apple provides infrastructure while oth=
ers provide intelligence.
The "measured approach" isn't caution=E2=80=94it's a worldview. And that wo=
rldview, no matter how beautifully executed, belongs to a world that no lon=
ger exists.
Strategic Takeaways for Builders
1. Ship Intelligence, Then Interfaces
This is nuanced, so be careful here. The most profound shift: users will to=
lerate broken interfaces to access transformative intelligence. Stop perfec=
ting the UI/UX and start shipping raw capability (at least in MVP). ChatGPT=
 launched with a bare text box and conquered the world. Your MVP should pri=
oritize intelligence access over polish.
However! In spaces that are crowded, polished AI is going to win. This spac=
e is maturing rapidly, and the bar is beginning to shift this year and next=
 toward polished intelligence AND polished UX. Keep your eye on this one.
2. Build for Federation, Not Ownership
The multi-model future is inevitable. Users will want Claude for writing, G=
PT for coding, Perplexity for research. Your product needs to be a great ci=
tizen in an ecosystem, not a walled garden.
If you build, assume you are building for a world where your users are loya=
l to utility, and where loyalty to brand is earned only by relentless commi=
tment to innovate at the speed of AI.
3. Embrace Public Learning Loops
AI products get smarter through usage. Every interaction teaches. Private d=
evelopment cycles mean missing the feedback that makes AI useful. Apple's i=
nstinct to perfect in private is precisely why Siri remains broken after 14=
 years.
Get used to getting public feedback more like Paul Graham and YC than like =
Apple. Get used to launching and learning fast.
4. Value Emerges from Collision
The breakthrough applications come from users doing things you never imagin=
ed. Over-curation kills innovation. Apple would never have allowed ChatGPT =
for therapy or Claude for legal drafting.
Be careful here, but get comfortable shipping and monitoring closely in pro=
duction. There=E2=80=99s an inherent messiness to probabilistic systems you=
 can=E2=80=99t weed out.
5. Talent Flows to Experimentation
The best AI researchers aren't going to companies that ship every three yea=
rs. They're going where they can experiment daily. Your hiring advantage is=
n't stability=E2=80=94it's velocity.
Reportedly, this is what Zuck used to convince the best researchers to join=
 Meta recently. He gave them unlimited GPUs. It wasn=E2=80=99t the money (a=
lthough hey backing up the truck is nice.)
6. Users Are Now Co-Creators
The priesthood model is dead. Users don't want to be told what's good=E2=80=
=94they want tools to create their own good. They're not waiting for your v=
ision; they're building their own with your tools.
Get excited about remixing. Get excited about your users riffing off your o=
wn ideas. People are sharing prompts with me where they ask the AI to act l=
ike Nate=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s cool! Very interesting. That=E2=80=99s the =
future we=E2=80=99re in these days.
7. Speed Beats Strategy
While Apple plans a 2027 robot, the AI landscape will have evolved through =
multiple generations. Their "measured approach" is structural paralysis in =
an exponential world.
Again go back to Paul Graham and YC: speed wins. The faster you execute the=
 more you have a strategic edge because your decisioning increases your sur=
face area for luck. Get excited about moving quick.
8. Broken Business Models Win
The companies transforming the world are ones traditional MBAs would never =
approve. Multiple $20/month subscriptions. Hallucinating products. Inconsis=
tent outputs. Users pay for capability, not polish.
You can overlean here and turn your company upside down on unit economics, =
but fundamentally it remains true that AI is leaning into capital availabil=
ity to scale innovation rapidly while new business models are immature.
I=E2=80=99m not one of those guys that thinks you can lose money forever=E2=
=80=94Uber got expensive for a reason=E2=80=94but I do think we=E2=80=99re =
still figuring out how to AI business models work and I=E2=80=99ve been thr=
ough enough innovation cycles to know that at this point in the cycle you l=
ean into the messiness and experiment with what gets you passionate custome=
rs and monetization, even if it=E2=80=99s weird.
9. Distribution Is Discovery
When everyone has access to the same base models, distribution becomes prod=
uct discovery. How users find and access intelligence matters more than own=
ing the intelligence.
This is where we see the advent of the creator as a core member of the foun=
ding team. The creator=E2=80=99s job (e.g. Cluely) is to achieve distributi=
on by getting brand signal in a world drowning in AI noise. If you can cut =
through the noise, you earn distribution.
10. Hardware Is Just Glass
The iPhone is becoming beautiful glass for accessing ChatGPT. Hardware with=
out intelligence is a commodity. The premium is in the bits, not atoms.
It=E2=80=99s not that hardware won=E2=80=99t matter, it=E2=80=99s that hard=
ware will only matter where it gives you extra leverage from an intelligenc=
e perspective, and we don=E2=80=99t yet have the first AI native device for=
 the AI age.
The Last Priests
We are living through the end of top-down technology design. For forty year=
s, we waited for companies like Apple to tell us what we needed, trusting t=
hat someone knew better than us.
That age is over.
The builders who matter now aren't perfecting experiences in secret. They'r=
e shipping intelligence and letting us figure out what to do with it. They'=
re comfortable with chaos, addicted to shipping.
This isn't just Apple's reckoning=E2=80=94it's ours. Every assumption about=
 how technology should work, how products should ship, how companies should=
 build=E2=80=94all trained by the old world of scarcity, secrecy, and contr=
ol.
The new world rewards different virtues: speed over strategy, iteration ove=
r perfection, federation over ownership. It's messier. It's more democratic=
=2E It's infinitely more powerful.
Apple will build their beautiful robot for 2027. It will be pristine, integ=
rated, and irrelevant. Because by then, we'll have built a thousand ugly th=
ings that change the world.
The question isn't whether you'll adapt. You will. The question is whether =
you'll help build it.
The tools are in your hands.
What will you ship tomorrow?

AI, announcements read like messages from a parallel universe where time mo=
ves differently. While Apple plans a 2027 robot, ChatGPT has already reache=
d ~800 million users, Microsoft has integrated AI across Office, and Google=
 has rebuilt search around AI and has reached hundreds of millions of users=
 themselves with Gemini. These companies measure progress in weeks; Apple i=

very Apple AI announcement follows the same trajectory: ambitious reveal, d=
elayed timeline, limited rollout, further delays, quiet scaling back of pro=
mises. Siri was going to become conversational years ago. The Vision Pro wa=
s going to revolutionize computing. Now a robot in 2027 will finally crack =
the code. So they say.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=

 Apple on a profound insight: computers were too powerful to remain impriso=

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Instead, intelligence is abundant but messy. Jobs' Apple was b=
uilt to make scarce computing power with no obvious utility accessible thro=
ugh perfect interfaces. But AI flips this: today=E2=80=99s intelligence is =
so powerful that it is obviously useful. People will wrestle with terrible =
interfaces to access it. ChatGPT launched with a bare text box. Nobody care=
d. It was too useful.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=

;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, users are=

es. Apple's priesthood model=E2=80=94wisdom flowing one direction from Cupe=
rtino=E2=80=94can't comprehend a world where products get smarter through i=

hings creators never imagined. ChatGPT for therapy, Claude for coding, Midj=
