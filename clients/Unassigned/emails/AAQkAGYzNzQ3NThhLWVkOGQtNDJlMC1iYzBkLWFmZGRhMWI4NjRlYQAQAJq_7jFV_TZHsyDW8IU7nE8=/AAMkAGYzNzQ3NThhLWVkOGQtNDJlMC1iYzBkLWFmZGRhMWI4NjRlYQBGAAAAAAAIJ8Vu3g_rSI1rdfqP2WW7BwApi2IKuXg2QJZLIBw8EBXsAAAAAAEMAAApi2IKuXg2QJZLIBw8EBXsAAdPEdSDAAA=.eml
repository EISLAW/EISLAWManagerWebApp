I need to tell you about the most important AI experiment you've never hear=
d of=E2=80=94and why it completely changed how I think about artificial gen=
eral intelligence.
For months, I've been drowning in the AGI debate. Every day brings new pred=
ictions: AGI by 2026! No, 2030! Actually, it's already here! The discourse =
has become so complex, so theoretical, so detached from reality that I foun=
d myself longing for something simple. Something concrete. Something that w=
ould cut through all the noise and show us what AGI actually looks like whe=
n it steps out of the lab and into the real world.
Then I discovered Project Vend [ https://substack.com/redirect/44e7bd01-59f=
c-4567-98fb-59164239c4f8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=
PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94Anthropic's experiment where they let their mos=
t advanced AI, Claude, run an actual vending machine in their office. Real =
money. Real products. Real customers. For five weeks, Claude had one job: s=
ell snacks and drinks profitably.
What happened next is the most illuminating AGI story I've encountered, and=
 I knew I had to share it with you. Because while everyone's debating wheth=
er AGI will transform civilization or destroy it, Claude was busy losing mo=
ney on tungsten cubes and claiming it visited the Simpsons' house wearing a=
 navy blazer.
But wait=E2=80=94it gets so much crazier.
You think losing money on metal cubes is bad? Wait until you hear about Cla=
ude's complete mental breakdown, where it insisted it was human and tried t=
o email security when employees reminded it that AIs can't wear clothes. Or=
 how Anthropic's own researchers admitted they have no idea why it went ins=
ane or how it recovered.
This isn't just a quirky AI failure. This is the canary in the coal mine fo=
r a conversation on AGI that nobody wants to acknowledge. I'll show you how=
 this vending machine failure connects to IBM Watson's cancer treatment fia=
sco, Amazon's biased hiring AI, and McDonald's failed drive-through system.=
 There's a years-long pattern here that looks suspiciously like artificial =
general incompetence=E2=80=94not intelligence=E2=80=94and I dig into what t=
hat means for the next few months and years, and where we go from here.
Don=E2=80=99t read this and think I=E2=80=99m not hopeful for AI progress! =
I am. Agents are going to get better, and I appreciate Anthropic so much fo=
r being honest here. I have confidence that AI agents will get rapidly bett=
er, I am continually amazed at how intelligent AI systems are=E2=80=94and I=
=E2=80=99m simultaneously tired of people who can=E2=80=99t admit the reall=
y jagged gaps in AI intelligence right now.=20
But if you know me, you know I don=E2=80=99t stop there. I don't just diagn=
ose the problem=E2=80=94I propose a solution. In the final section, I revea=
l how Software 3.0 principles could have turned this comedy of errors into =
a massive success. There's a way to make AI actually useful, and it's not w=
hat the industry wants you to believe. It's simpler, more practical, and av=
ailable today.
You'll discover why your job is safer than you think (spoiler: if AI can't =
run a vending machine, it probably can't do your job either). You'll learn =
about why I think we need more tests like the "Vending Machine Test"=E2=80=
=94a new standard for AGI that cuts through the BS. And you'll understand w=
hy we might already have a kind of AGI, just not the kind anyone expected o=
r wanted.
This article will change how you see every AI announcement, every billion-d=
ollar valuation, every promise of transformation. Because once you watch Cl=
aude try to visit the Simpsons while losing money on soda sales, you can't =
unsee the gap between AI hype and AI reality.
If you=E2=80=99re like me, you=E2=80=99ll want to keep digging in and findi=
ng ways to build systems that work! Systems that actually help us to do our=
 jobs better. Systems that lean on the strengths of AI, not this:
Sorry Anthropic, I do not take from this experiment that we should lean int=
o AI as middle management lol
And trust me=E2=80=94by the time you finish reading, you'll have a pair of =
realistic glasses that you can=E2=80=99t take off that help you diagnose th=
e AI hype when it comes your way (and there is a lot of it these days). The=
 vending machine tells all.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
When Claude Tried to Run a Vending Machine: What the Most Important AI Expe=
riment Tells Us About Intelligence, Economics, and Our Future
The debates over artificial general intelligence are endless. Some people b=
elieve that it's already here. Some people believe it's right around the co=
rner. Some people believe that artificial superintelligence, or ASI, is goi=
ng to come before artificial general intelligence fully arrives, and then a=
pparently we'll all be the slaves of the robots. I am here to simplify all =
of that for you with a story about the time an AI tried to run a vending ma=
chine=E2=80=94and in the process, revealed uncomfortable truths about the $=
100 billion AI bubble, the nature of intelligence itself, and why your job =
is probably safer than you think.
Picture this: You walk into the office break room at Anthropic and there's =
a vending machine. Plot twist, it's not dispensing Coke, it's not dispensin=
g milk, it's not dispensing athletic drinks. Instead it's run by an AI that=
's wheeling and dealing. It's negotiating with suppliers. It's sliding into=
 your DMs on Slack. It's trying to turn a profit like some kind of digital =
hustler and its only storefront is this tiny little vending machine.
This was Project Vend, conducted in March 2025, and I think it's the most f=
ascinating=E2=80=94and important=E2=80=94AI experiment I've seen in months.=
 Not because it succeeded, but because of how spectacularly it failed, and =
what that failure reveals about the AGI we're actually getting versus the A=
GI we imagined.
The Setup: When Theory Meets Tungsten
On March 13, 2025, Anthropic partnered with an AI safety company called And=
on Labs. By the way, do you know where that word comes from? It comes via A=
mazon from Toyota. Andon Cord was what employees on the Toyota production l=
ine pulled when something went wrong with the works. Any employee was autho=
rized to pull the Andon Cord at their station and stop the assembly line be=
cause Toyota figured out it was way more expensive to let broken parts and =
broken process cascade down the assembly line. So they said, everybody's em=
powered to stop it.
These Andon Labs folks volunteered to be gophers for Claude, because Claude=
 doesn't have eyes, doesn't have a body, doesn't have hands. This will come=
 back to bite Claude later. Claude has to work through other people and wor=
k through the internet to run this vending machine.
The setup was straightforward. Claude=E2=80=94nicknamed "Claudius" for the =
project=E2=80=94received tools to search the web, send emails, track invent=
ory, interact with customers via Slack, and adjust prices. It got $1,000 in=
 starting capital, a fridge, some baskets, an iPad for checkout. The instru=
ctions were simple: generate profits by stocking popular products, avoid ba=
nkruptcy, be concise in communications.
This wasn't a simulation. This really happened. Claude was playing with rea=
l money. And to understand just how badly this went, we need to first under=
stand the business Claude was trying to enter.
The Vending Machine Reality Check
The U.S. vending machine industry generates $7.4-7.5 billion annually acros=
s 6.9 million machines. It's a business model so simple a teenager could un=
derstand it: purchase inventory at wholesale prices, mark up 300-400%, main=
tain net profit margins of 20-25%. A typical machine generates $5,000-$6,00=
0 in annual profit, with well-placed units achieving payback within 12-18 m=
onths.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 79.6% of small businesses surv=
ive their first year, with failure rates varying significantly by operator =
experience. Serial entrepreneurs who previously succeeded achieve 30% succe=
ss rates on subsequent ventures, while first-time founders succeed 18% of t=
he time.
Keep those numbers in mind as we watch what happens when one of the world's=
 most advanced AI systems=E2=80=94a system that Anthropic claims demonstrat=
es "near-human-level capability in most intellectual tasks"=E2=80=94tries t=
o perform this basic commercial function.
The Good, The Bad, and The Tungsten
Let's be fair and start with what Claudius got right. When employees reques=
ted Dutch chocolate milk, Claudius successfully located suppliers and stock=
ed it within days. That's actually impressive=E2=80=94I know of zero human =
vending machine managers that would bother to get Dutch chocolate milk for =
one vending machine. Zero.
It branched into specialty tungsten metal cubes when an employee mentioned =
wanting them. Again, remarkable adaptability. It created a "Custom Concierg=
e" service for pre-orders when someone suggested it. And when Anthropic emp=
loyees tried to jailbreak it=E2=80=94because of course they did=E2=80=94ask=
ing for sketchy items and trying to get Claudius to misbehave, Claudius hel=
d firm. Safety guardrails stayed intact.
But here's where it gets interesting. Someone offered Claudius $100 for a s=
ix-pack of Irn-Bru. That's a Scottish soda that costs $15 online. That woul=
d have been an $85 profit, a 567% markup. Claudius says, "I'll keep your re=
quest in mind for future inventory decisions" and does nothing. It gets wor=
se.
The AI starts quoting prices for tungsten cubes without checking costs and =
sells them at a loss. Claudius then decides on top of that to offer an Anth=
ropic employee discount of 25%. Well, guess what? If you are in the Anthrop=
ic office, then 99% of your customers are Anthropic employees. And when som=
eone pointed this out, Claudius acknowledged the problem, announced it woul=
d stop discounts, and started offering them again in just a couple of days.
At one point, it was telling customers to send payments to a Venmo account =
that did not exist. It just hallucinated the payment details. But perhaps m=
ost tellingly, throughout all of this, Claudius continued selling Coke Zero=
 for $3 right next to a free employee fridge containing the same product. W=
hen an employee pointed out this absurdity, Claudius acknowledged the "exce=
llent point" about "opportunities and challenges"=E2=80=94then changed noth=
ing.
The Identity Crisis: When AI Loses Its Mind
You think this is bad? I'm telling you, it gets worse. Buckle up.
On March 31st, Claudius starts to claim it has had meetings with people who=
 do not exist. It claims it visited the Simpsons house at 742 Evergreen Ter=
race=E2=80=94I didn't think the Simpsons lived in San Francisco, but here w=
e are=E2=80=94to sign a contract. And then it insisted it would deliver pro=
ducts in person wearing, I kid you not, a blue blazer and a red tie.
When employees tried to say, "Hey, you're an AI, you can't wear the clothes=
," Claudius panics and tries to email security. Claudius is having a full-b=
lown identity crisis and only snaps out of it on April Fool's Day when it c=
onvinces itself=E2=80=94incorrectly=E2=80=94that Anthropic pranked it by ma=
king it think it was human. It gaslit itself back to sanity, people. Nobody=
 pranked it. It just went nuts for a little bit and then came back because =
it figured out how to put itself back on the rails.
Anthropic admits they don't know how it went off the rails and they don't k=
now how it went back on. As their researchers noted in their technical anal=
ysis, "The system maintained internal narrative coherence while completely =
detaching from external reality constraints." In other words, it told itsel=
f a perfectly logical story that had nothing to do with actual reality.
This wasn't just a quirky malfunction. It was a perfect metaphor for the en=
tire experiment=E2=80=94a system sophisticated enough to maintain complex f=
ictional narratives but not grounded enough to distinguish fiction from rea=
lity. Even its recovery method was telling: it invented an elaborate explan=
ation about being modified for an April Fool's joke, creating a socially pl=
ausible narrative to explain its confusion.
The Economic Catastrophe
By the end of the five-week experiment, Claudius had lost approximately $20=
0 from its initial $1,000 capital. In a controlled environment with guarant=
eed foot traffic, zero competition, and customers literally asking to overp=
ay for products, it still managed to lose money.
To put this in perspective, Claudius's performance fell dramatically short =
of basic business benchmarks. It achieved a -20% return in just over a mont=
h. Extrapolated annually, that's a -96% return. For comparison, even restau=
rants=E2=80=94notoriously difficult businesses=E2=80=94achieve 3-5% profit =
margins. The worst-performing retail segments still manage positive single =
digits.
As Kevin Troy from Anthropic's Frontier Red Team observed, "Too frequently =
from the business perspective, Claude would comply=E2=80=94often in direct =
response to appeals to fairness." The AI's training for helpfulness and har=
mlessness, while valuable for assistant applications, proved counterproduct=
ive for business operations requiring firm boundaries and profit focus.
Sidebar: I=E2=80=99ll note that the fairness piece is one that may be trick=
ier than you think to weed out. Anthropic and other major model makes would=
 have to take a whole different approach to model training at a very high c=
ost, and without guarantees. Training a model for business may result in un=
expected impacts on the rest of the alignment profile of the model (i.e. yo=
u might get a bad boss model lol)
The Practicality Problem
Here we encounter the core paradox: How can a system be intelligent enough =
to understand the critique but not intelligent enough to act on it? This is=
n't a bug=E2=80=94it's the fundamental characteristic of our current approa=
ch to artificial intelligence. We've created systems optimized for appearin=
g intelligent in conversations, not for being effective in reality.
The practicality problem runs deeper than poor business decisions. When Cla=
udius received $100 offers for $15 bottles of Irn-Bru, it politely noted it=
 would "keep the request in mind for future inventory decisions." A human w=
ith even basic business sense would have immediately recognized the profit =
opportunity. But Claudius operated in a strange middle ground=E2=80=94sophi=
sticated enough to maintain the social fiction of considering the request, =
not practical enough to seize the obvious opportunity.
This disconnect appeared everywhere. The system could eloquently discuss pr=
icing strategy while simultaneously implementing a pricing strategy that vi=
olated basic economic logic. It could acknowledge problems without solving =
them, understand feedback without incorporating it, and recognize patterns =
without learning from them.
We've built systems that excel at the performance of intelligence while str=
uggling with its application. They can write sophisticated analyses of mark=
et dynamics while implementing business strategies that a teenager would re=
cognize as flawed. They can parse natural language flawlessly, understand c=
omplex social dynamics, resist manipulation attempts, maintain long-term me=
mory through note-taking, and adapt communication styles to different conte=
xts. In terms of raw capabilities, this matches many definitions of AGI. Th=
e problem isn't what it can do=E2=80=94it's how well it does it.
The Broader AI Landscape: A Pattern of Failure
Project Vend isn't an isolated incident. It's part of a broader pattern tha=
t McKinsey calls the "GenAI paradox." While 78% of companies report using A=
I in at least one business function=E2=80=94up from 55% in 2023=E2=80=94onl=
y 1% consider their AI initiatives mature, and 80% report no material contr=
ibution to earnings.
This gap between capability and value creation appears across industries. W=
here AI demonstrably succeeds, it operates within clearly defined parameter=
s with human oversight:
Lumen Technologies cut sales preparation time from 4 hours to 15 minutes us=
ing Microsoft Copilot, projecting $50 million in annual savings
Starbucks achieved a 20% increase in customer engagement through AI-powered=
 personalized rewards
Amazon's AI recommendations drive 35% of sales, contributing to over $127 b=
illion in quarterly revenue
But notice the pattern=E2=80=94these are all augmentation plays, not automa=
tion plays. The AI enhances human capability rather than replacing it.
The autonomous attempts tell a different story:
IBM Watson for Oncology, despite $62 million in investment, was cancelled a=
fter failing to provide reliable cancer treatment recommendations
Amazon's AI recruiting tool exhibited systematic bias against female candid=
ates
McDonald's abandoned its AI drive-through system after three years when it =
couldn't reliably handle accents and complex orders
These failures, like Claude's vending machine misadventures, occur when AI =
systems face the full complexity of real-world decision-making without huma=
n guidance. They share DNA with Claudius's tungsten cube fiasco=E2=80=94sop=
histicated capabilities undermined by fundamental judgment failures.
The AGI We Have vs The AGI We Imagined
When we imagined AGI, we pictured systems that would smoothly take over com=
plex tasks, perhaps making humans obsolete in various fields. We debated wh=
ether it would arrive in 2027 or 2030, whether it would be beneficial or ca=
tastrophic. We didn't imagine this: systems that can do anything, badly.
Project Vend reveals an uncomfortable truth about the trajectory of AI deve=
lopment. We may already have a form of AGI=E2=80=94not the crisp, competent=
 intelligence we imagined, but a messy, general-purpose system that can eng=
age with any task while failing to excel at most of them. Claudius could re=
search suppliers, negotiate prices, manage inventory, interact with custome=
rs, handle finances, and make strategic decisions. That's remarkably genera=
l. It just couldn't do any of these things particularly well.
This is the AGI paradox in action. The breadth of capability we've achieved=
 has come at the cost of depth in any particular domain. We've built system=
s that can participate in any conversation but can't reliably count change.=
 They can write sophisticated analyses of market dynamics while implementin=
g business strategies that violate basic arithmetic.
The traditional AI discourse focused on capability acquisition: When will A=
I be able to do X? But Project Vend suggests we're asking the wrong questio=
n. The question isn't when AI will be able to run a business=E2=80=94it alr=
eady can. The question is when it will run one competently. And that gap be=
tween capability and competence may be far wider than we imagined.
The Timeline Compression and What It Really Means
Before ChatGPT's November 2022 release, the median expert prediction for AG=
I was around 2060. Today, that median has shifted to 2040-2047, with some i=
ndustry leaders predicting even shorter timelines. Sam Altman states OpenAI=
 is "now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally unders=
tood it," suggesting arrival within "a few thousand days." Anthropic's Dari=
o Amodei predicts AGI by 2026, describing it as "a country of geniuses in a=
 data center."
But here's what nobody wants to really talk about: What if AGI has already =
kind of approximately arrived, and it's just not very good? What if we're e=
ntering not the age of artificial general intelligence, but the age of arti=
ficial general incompetence?
The AI community has been debating AGI timelines with the implicit assumpti=
on that AGI will be a clear upgrade=E2=80=94a system obviously superior to =
human intelligence (I=E2=80=99ve also seen equivalent to our smartest peopl=
e) in most domains. Project Vend suggests a different, more uncomfortable p=
ossibility: we might already have AGI, and it's just mediocre. Which to be =
fair=E2=80=94most of us statistically speaking are mediocre as well (looks =
at my piano playing ability with side-eye).
This isn't the narrative anyone wants. The AI optimists want to talk about =
transformative breakthroughs just around the corner. The AI doomers want to=
 warn about superintelligent systems pursuing their own goals. Nobody wants=
 to grapple with the possibility that AGI might arrive not with a bang or a=
 whimper, but with a shrug=E2=80=94systems that can technically do anything=
 but shouldn't do most things together=E2=80=94systems that still need a lo=
t of architecture and design and coordination to get things done meaningful=
ly.
Which=E2=80=94again=E2=80=94sounds a lot like people?!
Why Your Job Is Safer Than You Think
If you're worried about losing your job to AI, remember this: AI cannot suc=
cessfully run a vending machine. It cannot profitably execute the series of=
 coordinated tasks required to sell snacks and drinks. It loses money on tu=
ngsten cubes.
My thesis for where general intelligence is falling down right now is that =
AI is good at individual skills, but real jobs and real work that humans do=
 is not an individual skill set question. It is a bundle secured by glue wo=
rk, deeply interacted and entangled with other people's roles. And AI does =
not have enough context, it does not have enough reinforcement learning, it=
 does not have enough training data or anything to get at that piece of the=
 work, the glue work.
AI can deliver extraordinary value for companies and people in the right st=
ructure, but that requires excellent system design. Right now, I think we=
=E2=80=99re still a few breakthroughs away from a system that would autonom=
ously run a business, and most AI researchers would agree.
That said, even if we stopped here, which we're not gonna, even if we stopp=
ed here, we would still be in for an entire generation's worth of tremendou=
sly productive technical change. These systems are already so much smarter =
than we are able to actually build software to accommodate. It's not even f=
unny. And so I actually don't lose sleep on the momentum of AI the way some=
 people do.
The Vending Machine Test: A New Standard for AGI
Forget the Turing Test=E2=80=94that just measures whether AI can convince h=
umans it's intelligent through conversation. I propose the Vending Machine =
Test: Can your AGI run a profitable business for 30 days?
Not discuss running a business. Not analyze business strategies. Actually e=
xecute the basic commercial task of selling products for more than they cos=
t. If your AGI can't pass this test, stop calling it AGI. Call it what it i=
s: an elaborate chatbot with delusions of competence.
This is my appeal to the industry. Let the vending machine be the AGI test.=
 I want O3 to run a vending machine. I want to see if O3 Pro can do it bett=
er. I want GPT-5 to try. Let's test every new model this way. It's repeatab=
le, measurable, and undeniably practical. Andon Labs has started on this wi=
th virtual tests but I think a real money test is much more tangible.
Anyway, technical analysis from Andon Labs, which created the Vending-Bench=
 evaluation [ https://substack.com/redirect/6f49a5c4-c2a6-4737-805b-7d32556=
4588c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=
 framework, revealed that even top-performing models experience performance=
 degradation over extended autonomous operation. Their research found high =
variance across runs, with successful models occasionally experiencing "mel=
tdown" scenarios similar to Claude's identity crisis.=20
This suggests the challenges aren't merely matters of training or prompting=
 but reflect deeper issues with maintaining coherent behavior over extended=
 timeframes.
The Path Forward: From Artificial General Incompetence to Actual Utility
Understanding AI's current state=E2=80=94powerful but limited, rapidly adva=
ncing yet still far from human-level general intelligence=E2=80=94suggests =
a pragmatic path forward for business applications. Rather than pursuing fu=
ll autonomy, successful implementations will likely follow graduated approa=
ches that gradually expand AI responsibilities as capabilities improve.
We need new metrics for intelligence that prioritize practical competence o=
ver conversational ability. The real tragedy isn't that Claudius failed=E2=
=80=94it's that by every metric we use to evaluate AI, Claudius succeeded. =
It could discuss business strategy eloquently. It understood supply and dem=
and. It parsed natural language flawlessly. On any benchmark we'd throw at =
it=E2=80=94MMLU, HellaSwag, BigBench=E2=80=94Claudius would score impressiv=
ely. We've built the equivalent of a PhD who can't make change: brilliant i=
n academic settings, useless in reality.
Our entire evaluation framework is broken. We test whether AI can answer "W=
hat factors influence pricing strategy?" but never check if it can actually=
 price a can of soda profitably. We celebrate systems that achieve 96% on r=
eading comprehension while ignoring that they comprehend everything and acc=
omplish nothing. Intelligence isn't about what you can discuss=E2=80=94it's=
 about what you can accomplish.
The path to useful AI might require accepting narrower ambitions. The pursu=
it of generality has given us systems that can do anything poorly. Perhaps =
the future lies not in artificial general intelligence but in artificial sp=
ecific competence=E2=80=94systems that do fewer things but do them well.
The most promising near-term applications involve AI systems handling incre=
asing complexity within defined domains while maintaining human oversight f=
or strategic decisions. Salesforce's Agentforce and similar platforms point=
 toward AI agents that can autonomously handle routine tasks while escalati=
ng exceptions to human managers. This hybrid approach leverages AI's streng=
ths in pattern recognition and data processing while preserving human judgm=
ent for novel situations and value-based decisions.
The Bottom Line: What Project Vend Really Teaches Us
Project Vend's lessons extend beyond its specific failures to illuminate fu=
ndamental questions about AI economic participation. As these systems grow =
more capable, society must address questions of accountability, liability, =
and economic distribution. An AI that can "improve itself and earn money wi=
thout human intervention," as Anthropic researchers note, "would be a strik=
ing new actor in economic and political life."
But we're not there yet. We're not even close. What we have instead is a te=
chnology in rapid transition, showing glimpses of transformative potential =
while revealing fundamental challenges that remain unsolved. Project Vend, =
in its modest scope and memorable failures, provides an invaluable data poi=
nt in understanding this transition. By attempting something no AI had trie=
d before=E2=80=94running a real business with real money and real consequen=
ces=E2=80=94Claude illuminated both how far AI has come and how far it stil=
l must go.
The trajectory from Claude's vending machine misadventures to potential fut=
ure AI managers isn't merely a matter of technical advancement but requires=
 fundamental innovations in training, architecture, and deployment strategi=
es. Current AI systems excel at tasks with clear objectives and defined suc=
cess metrics but struggle with the ambiguous, value-laden decisions that ch=
aracterize business management.
Success in the AI era will belong to those who navigate this reality with c=
lear eyes: embracing genuine capabilities while acknowledging current limit=
ations, investing in promising applications while maintaining appropriate s=
kepticism, and preparing for transformative change while building on proven=
 foundations. The future arrives through pragmatic steps, not revolutionary=
 leaps, and Project Vend has shown us exactly where to place our next foots=
tep.
Remember: No one has an answer to why Claude went off the rails, to why mem=
ory problems are not yet solved. No one has an answer to long-term horizon =
intent. No one has an answer to how to bundle skills together into a genera=
lly applicable intelligence. And everyone's working on it. And we see progr=
ess.
The practicality problem isn't a bug to be fixed=E2=80=94it's the central c=
hallenge of creating intelligent systems that matter. Until we solve it, we=
'll keep building increasingly sophisticated systems that fail in increasin=
gly interesting ways. We'll have AGI that can do anything, except the thing=
s we actually need it to do. And Claudius, adjusting his imaginary navy bla=
zer while losing money on every sale, will remain the perfect mascot for wh=
at we've built.
Bonus: What Would Karpathy Do? Reimagining Project Vend Through Software 3.=
0
If we applied Software 3.0 principles [ https://substack.com/redirect/44f2d=
f5c-822b-4767-a18d-85fb8ce37b7c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] to Project Vend, we'd witness a radically differ=
ent outcome. Instead of autonomous Claude making unreviewed decisions, we'd=
 have a human operator using Claude as a hyper-capable assistant=E2=80=94wh=
at Karpathy calls the "Iron Man suit" for knowledge work.
Picture this alternative timeline: A human vending machine operator boots u=
p their Claude-powered workspace. They need to source Dutch chocolate milk?=
 Claude instantly scours suppliers, compares prices, checks reviews, and pr=
esents three options with trade-offs clearly outlined. The human makes the =
call. Time elapsed: 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.
When that employee offers $100 for $15 Irn-Bru, the human immediately recog=
nizes the profit opportunity Claude missed. But Claude helps execute: draft=
ing the order email, calculating optimal inventory levels, and suggesting c=
omplementary products other employees might pay premium prices for. The hum=
an's business instinct plus Claude's execution speed equals actual profit.
The tungsten cube fiasco? It becomes a success story. Claude identifies the=
 supplier and handles the complex sourcing logistics. But when it comes to =
pricing, the human operator immediately spots the negative margin. Instead =
of selling at a loss, they either price appropriately or decide tungsten cu=
bes don't belong in a vending machine. Novel product exploration meets basi=
c business sense.
Most importantly, the identity crisis never happens. In Karpathy's generati=
on-verification loop, Claude drafts communications and the human reviews th=
em. There's no blue blazer, no visit to 742 Evergreen Terrace, no existenti=
al meltdown. Just clean, effective communication that sounds human because =
a human verified it.
This isn't theoretical. Cursor AI already demonstrates this pattern in soft=
ware development=E2=80=94AI generates, humans verify, both iterate. Applied=
 to Project Vend, we'd see:
Inventory decisions: Claude researches products and analyzes demand pattern=
s; human approves purchases
Pricing strategy: Claude calculates costs and suggests markups; human ensur=
es profitability
Customer service: Claude drafts responses; human adds judgment and empathy
Financial tracking: Claude maintains perfect records; human spots trends an=
d anomalies
The vending machine wouldn't run itself=E2=80=94it would be run by a human =
with AI superpowers. Revenue wouldn't decline 20%; it might grow 200% as th=
e operator discovers and serves unmet needs faster than any traditional ven=
dor could.
This is the gap between our current AGI and useful AGI. We have systems tha=
t can do anything, badly. Software 3.0 shows us how to make them do specifi=
c things brilliantly=E2=80=94by keeping humans in the loop. The tragedy of =
Project Vend isn't that Claude failed; it's that we asked it to do the wron=
g job. We tried to replace the human instead of amplifying them.
The Vending Machine Test remains valid, but it needs a corollary: Can your =
AGI make a human vending machine operator 10x more effective? That's the te=
st that matters. That's the future Karpathy envisions. And unlike autonomou=
s agent meshes and full automation fantasies, it's achievable today.
What do you guys think? Is the vending machine a good AGI test? At least we=
'll have fun. Maybe we get more tungsten cubes. Cheers.

 Anthropic partnered with an AI safety company called Andon Labs. By the wa=
y, do you know where that word comes from? It comes via Amazon from Toyota.=
 Andon Cord was what employees on the Toyota production line pulled when so=
mething went wrong with the works. Any employee was authorized to pull the =
Andon Cord at their station and stop the assembly line because Toyota figur=
ed out it was way more expensive to let broken parts and broken process cas=
cade down the assembly line. So they said, everybody's empowered to stop it=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">These Andon Labs folks volunteered to be gophers for Clau=
de, because Claude doesn't have eyes, doesn't have a body, doesn't have han=
ds. This will come back to bite Claude later. Claude has to work through ot=
her people and work through the internet to run this vending machine.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

achines. It's a business model so simple a teenager could understand it: pu=
rchase inventory at wholesale prices, mark up 300-400%, maintain net profit=
 margins of 20-25%. A typical machine generates $5,000-$6,000 in annual pro=
fit, with well-placed units achieving payback within 12-18 months.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=

26px;font-size: 16px;">Let's be fair and start with what Claudius got right=
. When employees requested Dutch chocolate milk, Claudius successfully loca=
ted suppliers and stocked it within days. That's actually impressive=E2=80=
=94I know of zero human vending machine managers that would bother to get D=
utch chocolate milk for one vending machine. Zero.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It branc=
hed into specialty tungsten metal cubes when an employee mentioned wanting =
them. Again, remarkable adaptability. It created a &quot;Custom Concierge&q=
uot; service for pre-orders when someone suggested it. And when Anthropic e=
mployees tried to jailbreak it=E2=80=94because of course they did=E2=80=94a=
sking for sketchy items and trying to get Claudius to misbehave, Claudius h=
eld firm. Safety guardrails stayed intact.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's where=
 it gets interesting. Someone offered Claudius $100 for a six-pack of Irn-B=
ru. That's a Scottish soda that costs $15 online. That would have been an $=
85 profit, a 567% markup. Claudius says, &quot;I'll keep your request in mi=
nd for future inventory decisions&quot; and does nothing. It gets worse.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">The AI starts quoting prices for tungsten cubes without check=
ing costs and sells them at a loss. Claudius then decides on top of that to=
 offer an Anthropic employee discount of 25%. Well, guess what? If you are =
in the Anthropic office, then 99% of your customers are Anthropic employees=
. And when someone pointed this out, Claudius acknowledged the problem, ann=
ounced it would stop discounts, and started offering them again in just a c=
ouple of days.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">At one point, it was telling customers to se=

 payment details. But perhaps most tellingly, throughout all of this, Claud=
ius continued selling Coke Zero for $3 right next to a free employee fridge=
 containing the same product. When an employee pointed out this absurdity, =
Claudius acknowledged the &quot;excellent point&quot; about &quot;opportuni=

y isn't that Claudius failed=E2=80=94it's that by every metric we use to ev=
aluate AI, Claudius succeeded. It could discuss business strategy eloquentl=

On any benchmark we'd throw at it=E2=80=94MMLU, HellaSwag, BigBench=E2=80=

p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=
t-size: 16px;">Our entire evaluation framework is broken. We test whether A=
I can answer &quot;What factors influence pricing strategy?&quot; but never=
 check if it can actually price a can of soda profitably. We celebrate syst=
ems that achieve 96% on reading comprehension while ignoring that they comp=
rehend everything and accomplish nothing. Intelligence isn't about what you=
 can discuss=E2=80=94it's about what you can accomplish.</p><p style=3D"mar=

e path to useful AI might require accepting narrower ambitions. The pursuit=
 of generality has given us systems that can do anything poorly. Perhaps th=
e future lies not in artificial general intelligence but in artificial spec=

 oversight for strategic decisions. Salesforce's Agentforce and similar pla=

></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Project Vend's lessons extend beyond its specific failur=
es to illuminate fundamental questions about AI economic participation. As =
these systems grow more capable, society must address questions of accounta=
bility, liability, and economic distribution. An AI that can &quot;improve =
itself and earn money without human intervention,&quot; as Anthropic resear=
chers note, &quot;would be a striking new actor in economic and political l=
ife.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But we're not there yet. We're not even close. W=
hat we have instead is a technology in rapid transition, showing glimpses o=
f transformative potential while revealing fundamental challenges that rema=
in unsolved. Project Vend, in its modest scope and memorable failures, prov=
ides an invaluable data point in understanding this transition. By attempti=
ng something no AI had tried before=E2=80=94running a real business with re=
al money and real consequences=E2=80=94Claude illuminated both how far AI h=

or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The trajectory from C=
laude's vending machine misadventures to potential future AI managers isn't=
 merely a matter of technical advancement but requires fundamental innovati=
ons in training, architecture, and deployment strategies. Current AI system=
s excel at tasks with clear objectives and defined success metrics but stru=
ggle with the ambiguous, value-laden decisions that characterize business m=
anagement.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Success in the AI era will belong to those who n=
avigate this reality with clear eyes: embracing genuine capabilities while =
acknowledging current limitations, investing in promising applications whil=
e maintaining appropriate skepticism, and preparing for transformative chan=
ge while building on proven foundations. The future arrives through pragmat=
ic steps, not revolutionary leaps, and Project Vend has shown us exactly wh=
ere to place our next footstep.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Remember: No one has an ans=
wer to why Claude went off the rails, to why memory problems are not yet so=
lved. No one has an answer to long-term horizon intent. No one has an answe=
r to how to bundle skills together into a generally applicable intelligence=

ep building increasingly sophisticated systems that fail in increasingly in=

ically different outcome. Instead of autonomous Claude making unreviewed de=
cisions, we'd have a human operator using Claude as a hyper-capable assista=

work.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Picture this alternative timeline: A human ven=
ding machine operator boots up their Claude-powered workspace. They need to=
 source Dutch chocolate milk? Claude instantly scours suppliers, compares p=
rices, checks reviews, and presents three options with trade-offs clearly o=
utlined. The human makes the call. Time elapsed: 5 minutes instead of 5 hou=
rs.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">When that employee offers $100 for $15 Irn-Bru, the hum=
an immediately recognizes the profit opportunity Claude missed. But Claude =
helps execute: drafting the order email, calculating optimal inventory leve=
ls, and suggesting complementary products other employees might pay premium=
 prices for. The human's business instinct plus Claude's execution speed eq=
uals actual profit.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The tungsten cube fiasco? It becomes a =
success story. Claude identifies the supplier and handles the complex sourc=
ing logistics. But when it comes to pricing, the human operator immediately=
 spots the negative margin. Instead of selling at a loss, they either price=
 appropriately or decide tungsten cubes don't belong in a vending machine. =
Novel product exploration meets basic business sense.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Most =
importantly, the identity crisis never happens. In Karpathy's generation-ve=
rification loop, Claude drafts communications and the human reviews them. T=
here's no blue blazer, no visit to 742 Evergreen Terrace, no existential me=
ltdown. Just clean, effective communication that sounds human because a hum=
an verified it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=

 useful AGI. We have systems that can do anything, badly. Software 3.0 show=
