WESTERN DIGITAL CORP (TICKER: WDC) might still live in your mind as
the brand behind My Passport and external hard drives from the early
2000s - but that=E2=80=99s only a small part of what it is today. In
reality, Western Digital has become a critical player in the
infrastructure backbone of the AI era.

Most people don=E2=80=99t realize this, but the cloud, enterprise, and data
center markets now account for the vast majority of Western
Digital=E2=80=99s revenue. This segment is powered by demand for
high-capacity nearline HDDs and enterprise SSDs - exactly the kind of
storage needed by hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google as
AI-generated data explodes.=C2=A0=C2=A0

The company=E2=80=99s client segment (think SSDs and drives inside PCs and
your laptops) makes up a bit more than a quarter of revenue.
Meanwhile, the consumer segment - the part most people associate with
WD, like My Book and WD Elements external drives - only represents
around 18 percent of sales.=C2=A0 I think it still does great as well by
the way but the big money is you-know-where (not in discounted hard
drives at Costco!).

In short: Western Digital=E2=80=99s business today is firmly aligned with
where the puck is going, not where it=E2=80=99s been. With flash pricing
recovering, enterprise demand rebounding WD is positioned to quietly
benefit from the AI data boom - without the hype premium.

MY SHORT PICK: DBX

DROPBOX INC (TICKER: DBX): another pioneer. It made file storage and
syncing across devices easy before the big tech giants caught up. But
now? It=E2=80=99s fighting an uphill battle in a game that=E2=80=99s comple=
tely
changed.

The core problem is this: Dropbox is a standalone service in a bundled
world. Remember my important points about ecosystems?=C2=A0 Google Drive
and Microsoft OneDrive come baked into the productivity suites that
dominate both consumer and corporate environments. They're deeply
integrated, often free, and constantly improving=E2=80=94especially as AI
begins to transform how files are organized, accessed, and searched.

Dropbox doesn=E2=80=99t have that kind of ecosystem. It=E2=80=99s not as
integrated into your email, your calendar, your documents, or your
meetings. That=E2=80=99s a real disadvantage as software consolidates and
users expect seamless, AI-powered workflows.

Revenue growth has stalled, and the company is increasingly leaning on
cost-cutting and share buybacks to keep investors interested. But it
lacks the product momentum or strategic edge to reignite growth in a
meaningful way.

This isn=E2=80=99t about Dropbox being a bad product. It=E2=80=99s about be=
ing
stuck in a model that feels increasingly obsolete. In a world where AI
and integration are driving the next wave of productivity, Dropbox
just doesn=E2=80=99t have the seat at the table it once did.=C2=A0 I want t=
o be
where the growth is.

Corp (Ticker: WDC)</strong><span style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; font-weig=
ht: 400;"> might still live in your mind as the brand behind My Passport an=
d external hard drives from the early 2000s - but that=E2=80=99s only a sma=
ll part of what it is today. In reality, Western Digital has become a criti=
cal player in the infrastructure backbone of the AI era.</span></span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=
ma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Most people don=E2=80=99t realize this, =
but the cloud, enterprise, and data center markets now account for the vast=
 majority of Western Digital=E2=80=99s revenue. This segment is powered by =
demand for high-capacity nearline HDDs and enterprise SSDs - exactly the ki=
nd of storage needed by hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google as =
AI-generated data explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=
ma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The company=E2=80=99s client segment (th=
ink SSDs and drives inside PCs and your laptops) makes up a bit more than a=
 quarter of revenue. Meanwhile, the consumer segment - the part most people=
 associate with WD, like My Book and WD Elements external drives - only rep=
resents around 18 percent of sales.&nbsp; I think it still does great as we=
ll by the way but the big money is you-know-where (not in discounted hard d=
rives at Costco!).</span></p>
<p style=3D"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style=3D"b=
ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=
ma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In short: Western Digital=E2=80=99s busi=
ness today is firmly aligned with where the puck is going, not where it=E2=
=80=99s been. With flash pricing recovering, enterprise demand rebounding W=
D is positioned to quietly benefit from the AI data boom - without the hype=
 premium.</span></p>

ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=

tandalone service in a bundled world. Remember my important points about ec=
osystems?&nbsp; Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive come baked into the pro=
ductivity suites that dominate both consumer and corporate environments. Th=
ey're deeply integrated, often free, and constantly improving=E2=80=94espec=
ially as AI begins to transform how files are organized, accessed, and sear=

f ecosystem. It=E2=80=99s not as integrated into your email, your calendar,=

ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=
ma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Revenue growth has stalled, and the comp=
any is increasingly leaning on cost-cutting and share buybacks to keep inve=
stors interested. But it lacks the product momentum or strategic edge to re=
ignite growth in a meaningful way.</span></p>

ox-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13pt; font-family: taho=

 bad product. It=E2=80=99s about being stuck in a model that feels increasi=
ngly obsolete. In a world where AI and integration are driving the next wav=
e of productivity, Dropbox just doesn=E2=80=99t have the seat at the table =
it once did.&nbsp; I want to be where the growth is.</span></p>
