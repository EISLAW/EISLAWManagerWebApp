DAILY MEMO: HAMAS RELEASES CAPTIVES, AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN CLASH [3]
EFFORTS TOWARD ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN GAZA CONTINUE, HOWEVER.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
HOSTAGES COME HOME. Hamas has released [4] the last 20 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza as part of the first phase of a ceasefire deal. On social media, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said
[5] his country’s primary task after their release is to destroy all remaining Hamas tunnels in Gaza. Over the weekend, the United States began deploying [6] 200 troops to Israel to establish a
coordination center to monitor the agreement's implementation, though they are not expected to enter Gaza. They will participate in transportation, planning, logistics, security and engineering and
work alongside representatives of partner countries. In addition, Israel’s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, together with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, commander of U.S. Central
Command Adm. Brad Cooper, the U.S. president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and other Israeli generals, conducted [7] a “field tour” in Gaza. Elsewhere, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said
[8] he was planning to visit Gaza.
KEY COMPONENT. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair met [9] in Jordan on Sunday with Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh to discuss postwar governance of Gaza. Blair had been
proposed as a possible member of an international “board of peace” to manage the situation there after the ceasefire’s adoption. In a statement, al-Sheikh said the PA was willing to work with
Blair, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump and other partners, on consolidating the ceasefire.
BORDER FIGHTING. Armed clashes erupted [10] on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border over the weekend. The Taliban government in Kabul said it had carried out a “retaliatory operation” in response to
Pakistan’s airstrikes last week on targets in Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesperson said at least 58 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the border fighting. However, according to the Pakistani
military, 23 of its soldiers were killed, while more than 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were left dead. Taliban outposts, camps, headquarters and support networks were also damaged. The Taliban
foreign minister said [11] Kabul had achieved its military objectives and hostilities were temporarily suspended.
UPHEAVAL. Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, has reportedly fled [12] the country after alleging on Sunday that an attempted coup was underway. His claim came after members of an elite army
unit threw their support [13] behind youth-led anti-government protests, saying they would command national security operations and coordinate all branches of the armed forces from their base on the
outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo. The president is due to address the nation [14] later Monday from an undisclosed location. The protests that started in late September erupted over nationwide
power and water outages and later grew to include demands for the government’s resignation.
CLOSE TIES. Syria’s defense minister, foreign minister and intelligence chief held talks [15] in Ankara with their Turkish counterparts. They discussed bilateral cooperation, counterterrorism
operations, border security, joint personnel training and regional stability. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said [16] following the meeting that his country did not consider Syria’s security
to be separate from Turkey’s own.
TRANSPORT TALKS. Representatives of the governments of Azerbaijan, Iran and Russia held talks [17] in Baku on expanding their logistics networks. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk said
that this year, more than 176,000 vehicles have carried cargo along the International North-South Transport Corridor, which stretches across all three countries and beyond into Iran and India.
WORKER RECRUITMENT. The Kremlin is stepping up [18] efforts to attract migrant workers from India and North Korea amid Russia’s severe labor shortages. According to Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence
Service, the number of Indian citizens entering Russia for employment increased from 813 in 2020 to 17,700 in 2025. Nearly a third of Russia's total quota of visas for foreign specialists has been
allocated to Indian citizens. Relatedly, India’s ambassador to Moscow announced [19] that his country will soon open a consulate general in the Russian city of Kazan.
SOUTH CHINA SEA DISPUTE. The Philippines’ Maritime Council accused [20] the Chinese coast guard of deploying water cannons and ramming a Philippine vessel near the Philippine-occupied Thitu Island,
part of the disputed Spratly archipelago. The Chinese coast guard, on the other hand, said two Philippine government vessels “illegally entered” waters near Sandy Cay, a coral reef in the northern
Thitu Reefs, and that one vessel “dangerously approached” a Chinese coast guard ship, leading to a collision.
