So the New York Times decided to spend Friday getting me vaguely riled up [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/e1efb061-93e7-4673-b9d1-b37087049ded?j=3DeyJ=
1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and that mot=
ivated me in a positive way to start reflecting on the fact that the innova=
tion side of the AI story isn=E2=80=99t told very well.
Like honestly most of what passes for innovation news is viewed through sel=
f-serving press releases from big companies, and everyone claims everything=
 is innovative, so what actually is?
Are there examples where we can reasonably say AI has already extended the =
cutting edge for humans? Where our horizon of knowledge is wider because of=
 AI already? Because if so, that=E2=80=99s a really big deal.=20
But there=E2=80=99s not really been a comprehensive list of those kinds of =
advances in one place. Until now. I made one so at least we have a record o=
f what looked innovative to us humans in 2025. I have a feeling this space =
is going to accelerate fast, and I=E2=80=99d like to write down some of tho=
se advances so we can check back in a few months and see what=E2=80=99s cha=
nged.=20
I don=E2=80=99t usually do a Sunday piece, but this felt like a nice blue s=
ky read=E2=80=94sit back, reflect on the possibility of AI innovating, thin=
k a bit about what that means for us and how AI innovation changes the way =
we think about our own species=E2=80=99 role in all this stuff.=20
I=E2=80=99ll give you my cheat code there=E2=80=94if you look a bit more ca=
refully at the way a lot of these innovations are getting done by AI, I don=
=E2=80=99t view them as inherently human discoverable at all, and I think t=
hat presents the interesting possibility that humans and AI have fundamenta=
lly different innovation modes that may prove complimentary if we allow tha=
t.
Sunday thinking!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Yes, AI can innovate=E2=80=A6
On Friday the New York Times dismissed artificial general intelligence as a=
 Silicon Valley fantasy, and I felt like I=E2=80=99d been personally taken =
behind the woodshed and shot.=20
I had literally just finished making the point to a colleague by email that=
 yes, AI can be innovative. And here the Grey Lady was insisting that just =
couldn=E2=80=99t be. Along with a lot of other rather vaguely founded state=
ments that amounted to an assessment that my entire industry was out in fan=
tasy land.=20
Look, it=E2=80=99s fair to ask in good faith! If you=E2=80=99re going to ma=
ke world-changing claims like machines can innovate you should be held to a=
 high standard. Entirely fair.
But what if you meet that bar (as an industry=E2=80=94not me personally) an=
d the media still doesn=E2=80=99t pay attention? What if the narrative that=
 AI is somehow a fake persists?=20
I am normally reasonably good about ignoring splashy media takes, but in th=
is case I think it=E2=80=99s actually constructive to respond. I am activel=
y trying to respond with facts to exactly the confusion this kind of narrat=
ive produces. And it just is simpler to write it down here, for everyone to=
 see. So let me recap, in one coherent arc, a few of the facts that undercu=
t the idea that this whole AI thing is basically a fake. And yes, I will be=
 putting citations further down.
First, the science: we already have AI systems that originate knowledge hum=
ans never conceived. DeepMind=E2=80=99s AlphaDev discovered brand-new sorti=
ng algorithms that now ship in mainstream C++ libraries. MIT=E2=80=99s mode=
l surfaced halicin, an antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria. Alpha=
Fold released 200 million protein structures, opening new vaccine and antib=
ody paths. GNoME generated 380 thousand stable crystals and a lab built for=
ty-one of them in two weeks. IBM=E2=80=99s battery twins compress years of =
cathode R&D into simulations, and NASA=E2=80=99s evolutionary design grows =
titanium mounts lighter and stronger than any engineer sketched. Those aren=
=E2=80=99t incremental tweaks; they=E2=80=99re proofs that modern models se=
arch vast, sparsely labeled spaces and deliver artifacts beyond human intui=
tion.
Second, the everyday impact: AI is already paying rent in the real economy.=
 UPS=E2=80=99s machine-learning route engine re-plans 55 thousand drivers=
=E2=80=99 stops each morning, saving 100 million miles and 10 million gallo=
ns of fuel every year. Microsoft=E2=80=99s Copilot rollouts show employees =
clawing back hours of drudgery each week. Multimodal systems like GPT-4o re=
ad a scribbled algebra problem through a phone camera, solve it conversatio=
nally, and switch languages mid-stream. Apple=E2=80=99s forthcoming Magnifi=
er feature lets low-vision users strap an iPhone to a Mac and zoom any corn=
er of a room. These are measurable gains, not speculative forecasts.
Do these systems have flaws? Absolutely. Bias, brittleness, insatiable data=
 appetites=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re real, and I call them out whenever I can=
=2E But the capacity for innovation=20=
is no longer a hypothesis; it=E2=80=99s a=
n empirical fact. That=E2=80=99s why blanket statements like =E2=80=9CAI ca=
n=E2=80=99t invent=E2=80=9D are not just wrong, they=E2=80=99re actively un=
helpful. They derail the conversation from questions that matter=E2=80=94ho=
w we verify outputs, how we source fresh training data, how workplace dynam=
ics shift as models grow more capable.
What frustrates me most is the media=E2=80=99s habit of recycling outdated =
tropes. Every time a headline claims AI is merely remixing text, my inbox f=
ills with reasonable people asking if the last two years of breakthroughs w=
ere smoke and mirrors. They deserve better. We can=E2=80=94and should=E2=80=
=94interrogate AI=E2=80=99s limitations, but we need to do it with current =
facts in hand, not with talking points from 2019.
So I=E2=80=99m asking for a higher-resolution conversation. Let=E2=80=99s d=
ebate why models advance faster in domains with provable ground truth. Let=
=E2=80=99s examine data-scarcity bottlenecks and the economics of compute. =
Let=E2=80=99s map how company culture changes when a model can draft a lega=
l brief or design a circuit overnight. Those questions are thorny and urgen=
t. Arguing about whether AI can create at all is yesterday=E2=80=99s fight=
=E2=80=94and the data has already decided it.
And yes, here=E2=80=99s a list that gets at some of the stories I reference=
 above, along with even more facts=E2=80=A6
And here are the receipts=E2=80=A6
1. AI is inventing genuinely new things
New algorithms =E2=80=94 AlphaDev uncovered faster C++ sort routines now sh=
ipping in LLVM, up to 70 % faster on short sequences. (Google DeepMind [ ht=

Stepping back from the catalog of breakthroughs, I=E2=80=99m reminded that =
the core question=E2=80=94whether today=E2=80=99s AI can genuinely create=
=E2=80=94remains very much alive. The evidence I=E2=80=99ve laid out does n=
ot end the debate; it reframes it. When reinforcement-learning agents disco=
ver faster algorithms, when a model proposes an antibiotic that defeats pan=
-resistant bacteria, or when a routing engine quietly saves a hundred milli=
on truck-miles, we can no longer treat innovation as a theoretical benchmar=
k. It is already part of the texture of our scientific labs, supply chains,=
 and assistive tools. Acknowledging that reality does not trivialize concer=
ns about bias, brittleness, or data scarcity; it simply grounds those conce=
rns in a world where AI-led invention is already underway.
From that starting point, the work ahead becomes both clearer and harder. I=
f models can originate solutions we didn=E2=80=99t foresee, how do we valid=
ate those solutions at scale and under uncertainty? What safeguards ensure =
that speed does not outrun rigor, or that new capabilities reach beyond the=
 early adopters who can most easily afford them? These are open, urgent que=
stions, and they deserve more than a binary yes-or-no framing.=20
My hope is that by grounding the discussion in concrete progress=E2=80=94an=
d by staying honest about the technology=E2=80=99s faults=E2=80=94we can mo=
ve toward a conversation focused on stewardship: directing AI=E2=80=99s cre=
ative power where it is most needed, building oversight that matches the pa=
ce of discovery, and widening the circle of beneficiaries. That is a challe=
nge worth wrestling with, and it begins by facing the facts, not the headli=
nes.

4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But what if you meet that bar =
(as an industry=E2=80=94not me personally) and the media still doesn=E2=80=
=99t pay attention? What if the narrative that AI is somehow a fake persist=
s? </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">I am normally reasonably good about ignoring splashy me=
dia takes, but in this case I think it=E2=80=99s actually constructive to r=
espond. I am actively trying to respond with facts to exactly the confusion=
 this kind of narrative produces. And it just is simpler to write it down h=
ere, for everyone to see. So let me recap, in one coherent arc, a few of th=
e facts that undercut the idea that this whole AI thing is basically a fake=
. And yes, I will be putting citations further down.</p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First,=
 the science: we already have AI systems that originate knowledge humans ne=
ver conceived. DeepMind=E2=80=99s AlphaDev discovered brand-new sorting alg=
orithms that now ship in mainstream C++ libraries. MIT=E2=80=99s model surf=
aced halicin, an antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria. AlphaFold r=
eleased 200 million protein structures, opening new vaccine and antibody pa=
ths. GNoME generated 380 thousand stable crystals and a lab built forty-one=
 of them in two weeks. IBM=E2=80=99s battery twins compress years of cathod=
e R&amp;D into simulations, and NASA=E2=80=99s evolutionary design grows ti=
tanium mounts lighter and stronger than any engineer sketched. Those aren=
=E2=80=99t incremental tweaks; they=E2=80=99re proofs that modern models se=
arch vast, sparsely labeled spaces and deliver artifacts beyond human intui=
tion.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">Second, the everyday impact: AI is already paying ren=
t in the real economy. UPS=E2=80=99s machine-learning route engine re-plans=
 55 thousand drivers=E2=80=99 stops each morning, saving 100 million miles =
and 10 million gallons of fuel every year. Microsoft=E2=80=99s Copilot roll=
outs show employees clawing back hours of drudgery each week. Multimodal sy=
stems like GPT-4o read a scribbled algebra problem through a phone camera, =
solve it conversationally, and switch languages mid-stream. Apple=E2=80=99s=
 forthcoming Magnifier feature lets low-vision users strap an iPhone to a M=
ac and zoom any corner of a room. These are measurable gains, not speculati=
ve forecasts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Do these systems have flaws? Absolutely. Bias=
, brittleness, insatiable data appetites=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re real, and =
I call them out whenever I can. But the capacity for innovation is no longe=
r a hypothesis; it=E2=80=99s an empirical fact. That=E2=80=99s why blanket =
statements like =E2=80=9CAI can=E2=80=99t invent=E2=80=9D are not just wron=
g, they=E2=80=99re actively unhelpful. They derail the conversation from qu=

becomes both clearer and harder. If models can originate solutions we didn=
=E2=80=99t foresee, how do we validate those solutions at scale and under u=
ncertainty? What safeguards ensure that speed does not outrun rigor, or tha=

 stewardship: directing AI=E2=80=99s creative power where it is most needed=
, building oversight that matches the pace of discovery, and widening the c=
