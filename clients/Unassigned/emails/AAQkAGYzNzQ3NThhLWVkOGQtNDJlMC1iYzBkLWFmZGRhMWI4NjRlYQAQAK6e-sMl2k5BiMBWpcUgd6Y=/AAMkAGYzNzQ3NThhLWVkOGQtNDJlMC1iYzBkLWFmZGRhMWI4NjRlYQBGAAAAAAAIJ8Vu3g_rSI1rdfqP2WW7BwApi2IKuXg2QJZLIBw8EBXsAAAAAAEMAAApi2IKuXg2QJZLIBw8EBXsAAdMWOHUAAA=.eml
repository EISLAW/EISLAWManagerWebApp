1. Deep Research Agents: A Systematic Examination And Roadmap
Watching: Deep Research Agents (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/2c65e=
a5b-cb3c-4a3b-b763-372a9c5b508a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]/code [ https://substack.com/redirect/880c16a9-d8=
de-47b7-9862-d298bbae762c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BD=
nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?  Large Language Models have evolved from handli=
ng isolated tasks like question answering to more complex capabilities, but=
 they still struggle with sustained, multi-step research workflows. Traditi=
onal approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improve factual a=
ccuracy but lack the ability to perform continuous reasoning and dynamic ad=
aptation. The paper addresses the need for autonomous AI systems that can c=
onduct end-to-end research tasks - from formulating research strategies to =
synthesizing comprehensive reports - without being limited by static workfl=
ows or pre-defined tool configurations.
How does it solve the problem? The authors conducted a systematic examinati=
on of Deep Research (DR) agents, analyzing their core components including =
search engine integration (API-based vs browser-based), tool invocation str=
ategies, and architectural workflows. They propose a unified classification=
 framework that differentiates between static workflows (predefined task pi=
pelines) and dynamic workflows (adaptive task planning), while also categor=
izing planning strategies and agent architectures (single-agent vs multi-ag=
ent). The paper examines optimization approaches ranging from prompt-based =
methods to supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with particul=
ar attention to how systems like OpenAI DR and Gemini DR implement these te=
chniques.
What are the key findings? The survey reveals that leading DR agents employ=
 diverse approaches: industrial systems like OpenAI DR use reinforcement le=
arning-based fine-tuning with single-agent architectures, while others adop=
t multi-agent configurations for task specialization. Browser-based retriev=
al provides more comprehensive access to dynamic content compared to API-ba=
sed methods, though at higher computational cost. The authors identify crit=
ical limitations including restricted access to proprietary data sources, s=
equential execution inefficiencies, and significant misalignment between cu=
rrent benchmarks (which focus on simple QA tasks) and the actual capabiliti=
es needed for comprehensive research report generation.
Why does it matter? These findings establish a foundational understanding o=
f how to build AI systems capable of autonomous scientific discovery and co=
mplex research tasks, potentially transforming how research is conducted ac=
ross disciplines. The identified challenges - particularly around benchmark=
 misalignment and the need for asynchronous parallel execution - provide a =
clear roadmap for advancing the field. As DR agents mature, they could dram=
atically accelerate research workflows by automating literature reviews, hy=
pothesis generation, and evidence synthesis, making sophisticated research =
capabilities accessible to a broader audience while augmenting human resear=
chers' productivity.

2. MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Hori=
zon Agents
Watching:  MEM1 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/a9445701-c7e0-449a-b=
3ec-394771be050d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=
AjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Modern LLM agents struggle with long-horizon, m=
ulti-turn tasks because they typically append all past observations, action=
s, and thoughts to the context at every turn. This full-context prompting a=
pproach creates an ever-growing prompt that leads to quadratic computationa=
l costs (or linear with KV caching), massive memory requirements, and degra=
ded reasoning performance as irrelevant information accumulates. Think of i=
t like trying to remember every single detail of a long conversation - even=
tually your brain gets overloaded and you can't focus on what's actually im=
portant anymore.
How does it solve the problem? MEM1 introduces a clever approach where the =
agent learns to maintain a compact "internal state" that serves as both wor=
king memory and reasoning space. At each turn, instead of keeping all previ=
ous information, the agent consolidates its prior memory with new observati=
ons into this internal state, then discards everything else. The framework =
uses reinforcement learning to train this behavior end-to-end - the agent i=
s rewarded for task success, which naturally incentivizes it to preserve on=
ly the most relevant information. They also introduce a masked trajectory a=
pproach to handle the technical challenge of training with dynamically chan=
ging contexts.
What are the key findings? When tested on multi-objective QA tasks, MEM1-7B=
 achieved 3.5=C3=97 better performance while using 3.7x less memory compare=
d to the larger Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model on complex 16-objective tasks. T=
he agent maintained nearly constant memory usage even as task complexity in=
creased from 2 to 16 objectives, while baseline methods showed linear memor=
y growth. Additionally, MEM1 demonstrated strong generalization - agents tr=
ained on 2-objective tasks successfully handled up to 16-objective composit=
ions without additional training.
Why does it matter? It demonstrates that LLMs can learn to manage their own=
 memory as part of their reasoning process, eliminating the need for extern=
al memory modules or architectural changes. This makes it practical to depl=
oy sophisticated AI agents for real-world applications like research assist=
ants, web navigation, and customer service, where interactions can span doz=
ens or hundreds of turns. By achieving better performance with less compute=
 and memory, MEM1 makes advanced AI capabilities more accessible and sustai=
nable, especially for organizations with limited resources.
3. Enhancing LLM Tool Use with High-quality Instruction Data from Knowledge=
 Graph
Watching: LLM Tool Use (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/734064f6-5041=
-4dd5-b19a-9d1aec84600b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnP=
G6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) to effect=
ively use tools has become crucial for expanding their problem-solving capa=
bilities beyond text generation. While previous approaches have attempted t=
o create instruction datasets for tool use, they've relied heavily on LLMs =
themselves to generate training data, resulting in inconsistent quality, in=
sufficient complexity, and prohibitively high costs. The random sampling of=
 APIs often leads to irrelevant tool combinations and overly simplistic que=
ries that fail to challenge the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Additionall=
y, the extensive manual review and revision required for LLM-generated data=
 makes scaling impractical.
How does it solve the problem? The authors propose leveraging knowledge gra=
phs (KGs) as a source of high-quality instruction data. Since KGs represent=
 structured knowledge with entities as nodes and relations as edges, each "=
entity-relation-entity" triple can be interpreted as an "input-function-out=
put" operation, naturally mapping to tool use scenarios. The framework uses=
 First-Order Logic (FOL) queries as intermediaries to systematically extrac=
t subgraphs and transform them into tool-use queries and solution paths. By=
 converting KG relations into executable APIs and parsing query pathways in=
to detailed solution steps, the method generates complex, multi-step tool c=
ombinations without relying on potentially flawed LLM-generated content.
What are the key findings? The experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM=
s with just a small sample (2,000 instances) of the KG2Tool dataset leads t=
o significant performance improvements on the T-Eval benchmark. For instanc=
e, ToolLM-7B achieved a 9.0% improvement over Qwen2.5-7B, reaching an overa=
ll score of 84.72 that surpassed GPT-3.5. Remarkably, ToolLM-14B achieved t=
he highest score of 87.21, even outperforming its larger 70B parameter coun=
terpart. The approach proved effective across different backbone models, wi=
th improvements ranging from 7.0% to 10.2% on various architectures.
Why does it matter? This addresses a critical bottleneck in developing tool=
-using LLMs by providing a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual a=
nnotation and unreliable LLM-generated data. Since KGs are manually curated=
 and verified, the resulting instruction data maintains high quality withou=
t requiring extensive human review or expensive API calls to commercial mod=
els. The ability to enhance smaller models (like 7B parameters) to achieve =
performance comparable to much larger models has significant implications f=
or deploying efficient LLM applications. Moreover, the method not only impr=
oves tool utilization but also enhances general capabilities, particularly =
in multi-step reasoning tasks, suggesting broader applicability beyond tool=
 use scenarios.

strong>What problem does it solve?</strong><span>  Large Language Models ha=
ve evolved from handling isolated tasks like question answering to more com=

rch workflows. Traditional approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (=
RAG) improve factual accuracy but lack the ability to perform continuous re=
asoning and dynamic adaptation. The paper addresses the need for autonomous=
 AI systems that can conduct end-to-end research tasks - from formulating r=

 conducted a systematic examination of Deep Research (DR) agents, analyzing=
 their core components including search engine integration (API-based vs br=
owser-based), tool invocation strategies, and architectural workflows. They=
 propose a unified classification framework that differentiates between sta=
tic workflows (predefined task pipelines) and dynamic workflows (adaptive t=
ask planning), while also categorizing planning strategies and agent archit=
ectures (single-agent vs multi-agent). The paper examines optimization appr=
oaches ranging from prompt-based methods to supervised fine-tuning and rein=
forcement learning, with particular attention to how systems like OpenAI DR=
 and Gemini DR implement these techniques.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =

hat are the key findings?</strong><span> The survey reveals that leading DR=
 agents employ diverse approaches: industrial systems like OpenAI DR use re=
inforcement learning-based fine-tuning with single-agent architectures, whi=
le others adopt multi-agent configurations for task specialization. Browser=
-based retrieval provides more comprehensive access to dynamic content comp=
ared to API-based methods, though at higher computational cost. The authors=
 identify critical limitations including restricted access to proprietary d=
ata sources, sequential execution inefficiencies, and significant misalignm=
ent between current benchmarks (which focus on simple QA tasks) and the act=
ual capabilities needed for comprehensive research report generation.</span=

 establish a foundational understanding of how to build AI systems capable =
of autonomous scientific discovery and complex research tasks, potentially =
transforming how research is conducted across disciplines. The identified c=
hallenges - particularly around benchmark misalignment and the need for asy=
nchronous parallel execution - provide a clear roadmap for advancing the fi=
eld. As DR agents mature, they could dramatically accelerate research workf=

 Modern LLM agents struggle with long-horizon, multi-turn tasks because the=
y typically append all past observations, actions, and thoughts to the cont=
ext at every turn. This full-context prompting approach creates an ever-gro=
wing prompt that leads to quadratic computational costs (or linear with KV =
caching), massive memory requirements, and degraded reasoning performance a=
s irrelevant information accumulates. Think of it like trying to remember e=
very single detail of a long conversation - eventually your brain gets over=
loaded and you can't focus on what's actually important anymore.</span></p>=

size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> MEM1 int=
roduces a clever approach where the agent learns to maintain a compact &quo=
t;internal state&quot; that serves as both working memory and reasoning spa=
ce. At each turn, instead of keeping all previous information, the agent co=
nsolidates its prior memory with new observations into this internal state,=
 then discards everything else. The framework uses reinforcement learning t=
o train this behavior end-to-end - the agent is rewarded for task success, =
which naturally incentivizes it to preserve only the most relevant informat=
ion. They also introduce a masked trajectory approach to handle the technic=
al challenge of training with dynamically changing contexts.</span></p><p s=

e using 3.7x less memory compared to the larger Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model =
on complex 16-objective tasks. The agent maintained nearly constant memory =
usage even as task complexity increased from 2 to 16 objectives, while base=
line methods showed linear memory growth. Additionally, MEM1 demonstrated s=

 </strong><span>Teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively use to=
ols has become crucial for expanding their problem-solving capabilities bey=
ond text generation. While previous approaches have attempted to create ins=
truction datasets for tool use, they've relied heavily on LLMs themselves t=
o generate training data, resulting in inconsistent quality, insufficient c=
omplexity, and prohibitively high costs. The random sampling of APIs often =
leads to irrelevant tool combinations and overly simplistic queries that fa=
il to challenge the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, the exten=
sive manual review and revision required for LLM-generated data makes scali=
ng impractical.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the proble=
m?</strong><span> The authors propose leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as =
a source of high-quality instruction data. Since KGs represent structured k=
nowledge with entities as nodes and relations as edges, each &quot;entity-r=
elation-entity&quot; triple can be interpreted as an &quot;input-function-o=
utput&quot; operation, naturally mapping to tool use scenarios. The framewo=
rk uses First-Order Logic (FOL) queries as intermediaries to systematically=
 extract subgraphs and transform them into tool-use queries and solution pa=
ths. By converting KG relations into executable APIs and parsing query path=
ways into detailed solution steps, the method generates complex, multi-step=
 tool combinations without relying on potentially flawed LLM-generated cont=
ent.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings?</strong><spa=
n> The experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs with just a small samp=
le (2,000 instances) of the KG2Tool dataset leads to significant performanc=
e improvements on the T-Eval benchmark. For instance, ToolLM-7B achieved a =
9.0% improvement over Qwen2.5-7B, reaching an overall score of 84.72 that s=
urpassed GPT-3.5. Remarkably, ToolLM-14B achieved the highest score of 87.2=
1, even outperforming its larger 70B parameter counterpart. The approach pr=
oved effective across different backbone models, with improvements ranging =
from 7.0% to 10.2% on various architectures.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: =

>Why does it matter?</strong><span> This addresses a critical bottleneck in=
 developing tool-using LLMs by providing a scalable, cost-effective alterna=
tive to manual annotation and unreliable LLM-generated data. Since KGs are =
manually curated and verified, the resulting instruction data maintains hig=
h quality without requiring extensive human review or expensive API calls t=
o commercial models. The ability to enhance smaller models (like 7B paramet=
ers) to achieve performance comparable to much larger models has significan=
t implications for deploying efficient LLM applications. Moreover, the meth=
od not only improves tool utilization but also enhances general capabilitie=
s, particularly in multi-step reasoning tasks, suggesting broader applicabi=
lity beyond tool use scenarios.</span></p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;lin=
