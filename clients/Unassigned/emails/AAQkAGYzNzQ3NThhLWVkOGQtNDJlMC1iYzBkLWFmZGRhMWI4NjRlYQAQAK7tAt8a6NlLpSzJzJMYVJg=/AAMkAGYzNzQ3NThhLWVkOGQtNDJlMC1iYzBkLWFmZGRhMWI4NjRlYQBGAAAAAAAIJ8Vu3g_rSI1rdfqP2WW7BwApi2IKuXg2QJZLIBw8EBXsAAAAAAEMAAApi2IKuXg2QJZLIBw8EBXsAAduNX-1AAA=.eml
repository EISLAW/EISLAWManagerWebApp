Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
Computer-Use Agent (CUA): An AI system that can directly operate a computer=
=E2=80=99s user interface - clicking, typing, navigating menus - to perform=
 tasks, often trained on large datasets of recorded human interactions.
Multimodal: In AI, the ability to handle and integrate multiple types of in=
put/output - e.g., text, images, audio, video - within a single system.
Semantic Memory: Knowledge stored in a structured way (facts, concepts, rel=
ationships) rather than as raw sequences - helps AI recall general truths i=
nstead of just events.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): A reasoning approach where an AI explicitly generat=
es intermediate steps before giving a final answer =E2=80=94 like showing y=
our work in math class.
Group-Filtered Policy Optimization (GFPO): A reinforcement learning trainin=
g trick where you generate multiple candidate answers, then keep only the c=
oncise, correct ones before updating the model - effectively teaching it to=
 think shorter and sharper.
Tool Call: An action where an AI agent invokes an external function, API, o=
r service (e.g., a search engine or calculator) during reasoning.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A method where the model fetches rele=
vant information from an external database or search system before (and whi=
le) generating its answer, so it can stay factual and up to date.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): A neural network architecture that contains many =
specialized sub-models (=E2=80=9Cexperts=E2=80=9D) but only activates a sub=
set for each input, making it both efficient and versatile.
Zero-Shot: Asking a model to do a task without giving it any task-specific =
examples during training - the AI must generalize from what it already know=
s.
Self-Play: A training setup where AI systems generate their own challenges =
and solutions to improve iteratively - like practicing chess against yourse=
lf to get better.

OpenCUA is a new open-source framework for building AI agents that perform =
computer GUI tasks. It includes an annotation tool and AgentNet, a large-sc=
ale dataset of human computer-use demonstrations spanning 3 operating syste=
ms and 200+ applications. Using a scalable pipeline (with recorded =E2=80=
=9Cchain-of-thought=E2=80=9D rationales), OpenCUA-trained models set a new =
state-of-the-art on benchmarks =E2=80=93 a 32B model attained 34.8% success=
 on the OSWorld-Verified suite, surpassing OpenAI=E2=80=99s GPT-4-based age=
nt. All annotation tools, datasets, code, and models are being released to =
spur open research on Computer-Use Agents (CUAs).

Echo-4o harnesses OpenAI GPT-4=E2=80=99s image generation (GPT-4o) to creat=
e a synthetic training set that fills gaps in real-image data. The authors =
generated 180,000 GPT-4o images focusing on rare or imaginative scenarios t=
hat are underrepresented in standard datasets (e.g. surreal fantasy scenes,=
 multi-object compositions). These synthetic images provide cleaner, more a=
ligned training signals (with detailed text descriptions) compared to noisy=
 real data. Fine-tuning an open multimodal model on this Echo-4o-Image data=
set yielded Echo-4o, which achieves strong results on new, challenging eval=
uation benchmarks (GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench) for creative image generati=
on. Notably, using the GPT-4o synthetic data also boosted other foundation =
models (OmniGen2, BLIP3-o), showing the approach=E2=80=99s broad utility.

This comprehensive 82-page survey reviews the landscape of techniques for i=
mproving LLM efficiency. It covers a range of model architecture innovation=
s beyond the standard Transformer: from linearized and sparse sequence mode=
ls to efficient attention variants, sparse Mixture-of-Experts, hybrid model=
s, and even emerging diffusion-based language models. The authors group 200=
+ papers into these categories and discuss applications to modalities beyon=
d text. The survey serves as a blueprint of modern efficient LLM design, hi=
ghlighting how these methods reduce computation and memory needs while main=
taining performance. It aims to guide future research toward more efficient=
, scalable foundation models.

Researchers introduced M3-Agent, a multimodal AI agent framework equipped w=
ith an explicit long-term memory. Like a person, M3-Agent processes real-ti=
me visual and auditory input and builds two types of memory: an episodic me=
mory of recent events and a semantic memory of accumulated world knowledge.=
 Uniquely, the memory is organized in an entity-centered, multimodal graph,=
 enabling the agent to maintain a consistent understanding of people, place=
s, and objects over time. When given instructions, M3-Agent engages in mult=
i-turn reasoning, retrieving relevant facts from its memory to aid decision=
-making. On a new long-video QA benchmark (M3-Bench), M3-Agent (trained via=
 RL) outperformed a strong GPT-4o-powered baseline by 5=E2=80=938% in accur=
acy across various test sets. This demonstrates more human-like recall and =
reasoning, especially in long-horizon tasks, and the authors open-sourced t=
he model, code, and a new 1000+ video dataset for multimodal memory researc=
h.
Sample More to Think Less: Concise Reasoning via GFPO (paper [ https://subs=

Group-Filtered Policy Optimization (GFPO) is a new RL fine-tuning method th=
at teaches LLMs to reason succinctly. When training on a reasoning task, GF=
PO generates a group of candidate solutions for each problem and filters th=
em using two metrics =E2=80=93 (1) brevity (response length) and (2) token =
efficiency (reward per token). By only reinforcing solutions that are both =
accurate and concise, the model learns to avoid the common tendency of RL-t=
uned LLMs to produce verbose, filler-laden explanations. In experiments on =
math and coding benchmarks, applying GFPO to a 4-billion-parameter reasoner=
 cut the length of its answers by 46=E2=80=9385% (drastically reducing unne=
cessary text) while maintaining accuracy. An adaptive difficulty variant of=
 GFPO further improved efficiency on hard questions. In short, GFPO trades =
a bit more training compute for significantly less reasoning overhead at in=
ference, a promising step toward cost-effective yet rigorous reasoning.

=2E The authors also built a self-play=20=
data generation scheme: a prompt-based=
 32B LLM (named QwQ-32B) that autonomously creates challenging question-ans=
wer tasks for the agent to practice. Through this large-scale training, the=
 resulting agent achieved massive improvements on knowledge-seeking benchma=
rks =E2=80=93 for example, +46.7% (Avg@4 score) on xBench and +20.8% on GAI=
A versus previous state-of-the-art. Notably, ASearcher=E2=80=99s Web-QwQ ag=
ent, which uses no external API calls (only its own LLM), achieved Avg@4 sc=
ores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, outperforming all prior open 32B a=
gents. The project is open-sourced, offering the community a path to train =
truly long-horizon autonomous search agents.

A new study evaluated an early GPT-5 model on challenging medical reasoning=
 tasks and found it significantly surpasses GPT-4 in this domain. GPT-5 was=
 tested on both text-based and image-based medical question answering (for =
example, diagnosing from clinical narratives and X-ray images) under a zero=
-shot chain-of-thought setting. Across multiple benchmarks =E2=80=93 includ=
ing MedQA, multimodal MedXpertQA, MMLU medical exam subsets, and the USMLE =
exams =E2=80=93 GPT-5 achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and substantial ga=
ins in multimodal understanding. On the MedXpertQA-MM dataset, GPT-5 improv=
ed reasoning and understanding scores by +29.3% and +26.2% over GPT-4o, res=
pectively, even outperforming licensed human physicians by about 24=E2=80=
=9329% in those areas. (By contrast, GPT-4o was still below human-expert le=
vel on most metrics.) A case study highlights GPT-5=E2=80=99s ability to co=
mbine visual and textual clues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, =
often recommending correct high-stakes interventions. These results suggest=
 GPT-5 has crossed into above-human performance on controlled medical reaso=

ParallelSearch is a new framework to speed up LLM-augmented search by decom=
posing queries and executing sub-queries in parallel. Today=E2=80=99s retri=
eval-augmented LLM agents usually handle multi-part queries in a serial man=
ner =E2=80=93 e.g. to answer =E2=80=9CWho is older, Monet or Pissarro?=E2=
=80=9D, a standard agent would do one search for Monet=E2=80=99s birthdate,=
 then another for Pissarro=E2=80=99s, then compare. This sequential approac=
h incurs unnecessary latency, especially when sub-questions are independent=
=2E ParallelSearch uses reinforcement l=
earning (with verifiable reward signal=
s) to train an LLM agent to detect when a question can be split into indepe=
ndent parts and to issue those search queries simultaneously. On seven ques=
tion-answering benchmarks, a ParallelSearch-augmented agent outperformed SO=
TA by an average of +2.9%, and on specifically parallelizable queries it sa=
w a +12.7% accuracy boost while using only ~70% of the usual LLM calls. In =
practice this means much faster query resolution (fewer reasoning steps and=
 search rounds) with no loss in answer quality. ParallelSearch thus offers =
a promising route to more efficient reasoning-enhanced search engines.

MolmoAct introduces a class of robotic foundation models called Action Reas=
oning Models (ARMs) that perform explicit spatial reasoning between percept=
ion and action. Unlike end-to-end policies that map images directly to robo=
t controls, MolmoAct uses a structured three-stage pipeline: (1) it encodes=
 visual observations and instructions into =E2=80=9Cdepth-aware=E2=80=9D pe=
rception tokens, (2) it plans at an intermediate level by generating a spat=
ial trajectory sketch (an editable path or trace in the environment), and (=
3) it translates that plan into low-level motor actions. This approach yiel=
ds more explainable and steerable behavior =E2=80=93 the mid-level plan can=
 be visualized or adjusted by a human before execution. MolmoAct (7B parame=
ters) achieved state-of-the-art results on several robot benchmarks, includ=
ing 70.5% zero-shot success on SimplerEnv (visual tasks) and 86.6% success =
on LIBERO, outperforming prior models like Pi-0 and ThinkAct (it was +6.3% =
higher on LIBERO=E2=80=99s long-horizon tasks). In real-world robot trials,=
 fine-tuned MolmoAct models also showed large gains =E2=80=93 e.g. +10% sin=
gle-arm and +22.7% bimanual task completion improvement over the Pi-0-FAST =
baseline. The model demonstrated stronger generalization to novel scenarios=
 (+23.3% on out-of-distribution tests) and received the highest human prefe=
rence scores for following open-ended instructions and trajectory adjustmen=
ts. Alongside the model, the team released a new MolmoAct Dataset of 10k hi=
gh-quality, diverse robot trajectories, and open-sourced all code and weigh=
ts. MolmoAct represents a new state-of-the-art in robotics, and an open blu=
eprint for building AI agents that think before they act in physical enviro=
nments.

GLM-4.5 is a new open-source Mixture-of-Experts LLM from Tsinghua Universit=
y and Zhipu AI, targeting Agentic, Reasoning, and Coding (ARC) abilities. I=
t packs a massive 355 billion parameters in total (with 32B active at any t=
ime) and introduces a hybrid reasoning approach that can toggle between =E2=
=80=9Cchain-of-thought=E2=80=9D mode and direct answer mode. Trained over 2=
3 trillion tokens and further refined with expert iterations and RLHF, GLM-=
4.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a range of challenging benchma=
rks. For instance, it scored 70.1% on the TAU agentic reasoning benchmark, =
91.0% on the AIME-24 math competition, and 64.2% on the SWE-Bench software =
engineering test. Despite using fewer overall parameters than some propriet=
ary models, these results rank GLM-4.5 3rd overall among all evaluated mode=
ls (and 2nd on agentic reasoning tasks) as of its release. Perhaps most exc=
iting: the full 355B model and a more accessible 106B distilled version (=
=E2=80=9CGLM-4.5-Air=E2=80=9D) are being publicly released. This makes GLM-=
4.5 the largest open-source MoE LLM to date, offering the research communit=
y a powerful foundation for building advanced reasoning agents and coding a=
ssistants.

ize: 16px;"><strong>Group-Filtered Policy Optimization (GFPO)</strong><span=
> is a new RL fine-tuning method that teaches LLMs to reason succinctly. Wh=
en training on a reasoning task, GFPO generates a </span><em>group</em><spa=
n> of candidate solutions for each problem and filters them using two metri=
cs =E2=80=93 (1) </span><strong>brevity</strong><span> (response length) an=
d (2) </span><strong>token efficiency</strong><span> (reward per token). By=
 only reinforcing solutions that are both accurate </span><em>and</em><span=
> concise, the model learns to avoid the common tendency of RL-tuned LLMs t=
o produce verbose, filler-laden explanations. In experiments on math and co=
ding benchmarks, applying GFPO to a 4-billion-parameter reasoner cut the le=
ngth of its answers by </span><strong>46=E2=80=9385%</strong><span> (drasti=
cally reducing unnecessary text) while </span><strong>maintaining accuracy<=
/strong><span>. An </span><em>adaptive difficulty</em><span> variant of GFP=
O further improved efficiency on hard questions. In short, GFPO trades a bi=
t more training compute for significantly less reasoning overhead at infere=
nce, a promising step toward cost-effective yet rigorous reasoning.</span><=

day=E2=80=99s retrieval-augmented LLM agents usually handle multi-part quer=

n><em>=E2=80=9CWho is older, Monet or Pissarro?=E2=80=9D</em><span>, a stan=

for Pissarro=E2=80=99s, then compare. This sequential approach incurs unnec=
essary latency, especially when sub-questions are independent. ParallelSear=
ch uses reinforcement learning (with </span><strong>verifiable reward signa=

plit into independent parts and to issue those search queries simultaneousl=
y. On seven question-answering benchmarks, a ParallelSearch-augmented agent=

 new open-source </span><em>Mixture-of-Experts</em><span> LLM from Tsinghua=
 University and Zhipu AI, targeting </span><strong>Agentic, Reasoning, and =
Coding (ARC)</strong><span> abilities. It packs a massive 355 billion param=
eters in total (with 32B active at any time) and introduces a hybrid reason=
ing approach that can toggle between =E2=80=9Cchain-of-thought=E2=80=9D mod=
e and direct answer mode. Trained over 23 trillion tokens and further refin=
ed with expert iterations and RLHF, GLM-4.5 has demonstrated top-tier perfo=
rmance on a range of challenging benchmarks. For instance, it scored </span=
><strong>70.1%</strong><span> on the TAU agentic reasoning benchmark, </spa=
n><strong>91.0%</strong><span> on the AIME-24 math competition, and </span>=
<strong>64.2%</strong><span> on the SWE-Bench software engineering test. De=
spite using fewer overall parameters than some proprietary models, these re=
sults rank GLM-4.5 </span><strong>3rd overall</strong><span> among all eval=
uated models (and </span><strong>2nd</strong><span> on agentic reasoning ta=
sks) as of its release. Perhaps most exciting: the full 355B model </span><=
strong>and</strong><span> a more accessible 106B distilled version (=E2=80=
=9CGLM-4.5-Air=E2=80=9D) are being publicly released. This makes GLM-4.5 th=
e largest open-source MoE LLM to date, offering the research community a po=
werful foundation for building advanced reasoning agents and coding assista=
nts.</span></p><div style=3D"font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"><hr style=
