Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
KV-cache (short-term memory): The Transformer=E2=80=99s rolling buffer of k=
eys/values for recent tokens; great for the last few pages, useless for the=
 novel you read last week.
Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN): A learnable =E2=80=9Clong-term memory=
=E2=80=9D that compresses old tokens into a compact state while keeping the=
 recent KV-cache intact - like archiving yesterday=E2=80=99s notes so today=
=E2=80=99s tab stays snappy.
Sliding-window attention: Reading only the last N tokens to save compute; f=
aster, but forgetful. AHNs aim to fix the forgetting.
Planner / Executor / Verifier (agent stack): A modular agent design: one pa=
rt makes a plan, one acts (API / tool use), one checks the work. Fewer tang=
les, better long-horizon control.
MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search): Try many futures, keep the promising branch=
es - search that pairs perfectly with a code-based simulator.
Code World Model (CWM): Instead of guessing the next move, the LLM writes a=
 game simulator in code (rules, legal moves, win checks) and lets search (e=
=2Eg., MCTS) plan - fewer illegal moves, deeper tactics.
Hidden-information game: Games where not all facts are visible (e.g., cards=
 in hand). CWMs include inference functions to reason under uncertainty.
Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling (paper =

Artificial Hippocampus Networks (AHNs) convert lossless short-term memory (=
the Transformer=E2=80=99s growing KV cache) into a fixed-size compressed lo=
ng-term memory using RNN-like modules. This hybrid memory design retains ex=
act recent information while continually compressing out-of-window context,=
 letting the model harness both memory types for efficient long-sequence pr=
ocessing.
Maintains a sliding-window of the Transformer=E2=80=99s key-value cache as =
lossless short-term memory, and introduces a learnable Artificial Hippocamp=
us Network to compress older tokens into a compact long-term memory. This d=
esign is inspired by the brain=E2=80=99s multi-store memory model, combinin=
g the fidelity of attention with the efficiency of recurrent memory.
On long-context benchmarks, AHN-augmented models outperform sliding-window =
Transformers and even rival full attention, all with far less computation a=
nd memory usage. For example, adding AHN to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct cuts infere=
nce FLOPs by ~40% and memory use by 74%, while improving its long-context e=
valuation score from 4.41 to 5.88.
In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization for Effective Planning and Tool Use=

Introduces AgentFlow, a trainable agentic framework that decomposes an AI a=
gent into specialized modules =E2=80=93 planner, executor, verifier, genera=
tor =E2=80=93 which work together over multi-turn interactions. Unlike mono=
lithic tool-using policies that intermix reasoning and API calls (and strug=
gle with long sequences), AgentFlow optimizes its planning module in the lo=
op of live multi-turn tasks for better long-horizon performance.
Proposes a new on-policy training algorithm Flow-GRPO to handle long-horizo=
n, sparse rewards by treating a multi-turn task as a series of single-turn =
updates. It backpropagates a single final outcome to each step (aligning lo=
cal decisions with global success) and normalizes advantages to stabilize l=
earning.
Significant gains: In 10 benchmarks spanning search, agent, math, and scien=
ce tasks, AgentFlow (with a 7B LLM backbone) outperforms state-of-the-art b=
aselines by ~14% on average, even surpassing larger models like GPT-4 on se=
veral tasks. Analysis shows the in-the-flow training yields improved planni=
ng strategies, more reliable tool use, and better scaling with model size a=
nd reasoning turns.
Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks (paper [ https://subst=
ack.com/redirect/07f4bb60-4edf-4537-8124-878b12bc40d1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6I=

The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) demonstrated that two small networks=
 (total 27M params) could outperform large LLMs on puzzles like Sudoku, Maz=
e, and ARC by reasoning recursively. However, HRM=E2=80=99s two-module desi=
gn (fast =E2=80=9Clow-level=E2=80=9D and slow =E2=80=9Chigh-level=E2=80=9D =
networks) was complex and not fully understood.
This work introduces a Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) that strips away HRM=E2=
=80=99s complexity. TRM uses a single tiny network (only 2 layers, ~7M para=

chieves significantly higher generalization than HRM. It scored 45% on ARC-=
AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, outperforming much larger LLMs (DeepSeek R1, o3-=
mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) while using under 0.01% of their parameters. In other=
 words, careful recursive reasoning can beat brute-force model size.
Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language =
Models (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/579ebef7-f076-4f79-99ad-867d9=

Many LLM applications (agents, domain experts) improve via context adaptati=
on =E2=80=93 refining prompts or adding strategies =E2=80=93 instead of upd=
ating model weights. However, naive prompt editing often introduces brevity=
 bias (over-summarizing away important details) or context collapse (degrad=
ing information with each iterative rewrite).
The Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) framework treats the prompt and conte=
xt as an evolving playbook that is continuously expanded and refined. Throu=
gh a cycle of generation, reflection, and curation, ACE accumulates and org=
anizes strategies in the context while making structured, incremental updat=
es to prevent losing details over long dialogues. This builds on the Dynami=
c Cheatsheet idea of an adaptive memory but in a more modular, agent-driven=
 way.
ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g. improving system prompts) and onl=
ine (the agent=E2=80=99s memory during an interaction), yielding strong gai=
ns. It outperformed prior context-tuning methods by +10.6% on agent benchma=
rks and +8.6% on a finance QA benchmark, all while reducing prompt adaptati=
on latency and cost. Notably, ACE requires no supervised training data =E2=
=80=93 it learns to refine contexts by leveraging natural feedback from the=
 agent=E2=80=99s own executions. On the AppWorld leaderboard, an ACE-empowe=
red agent matched the top production agent=E2=80=99s overall score and beat=
 it on the hardest test split, despite using a smaller open-source model. T=
his showcases how evolving contextual =E2=80=9Csoftware=E2=80=9D can drive =
self-improvement in LLMs without changing the model itself.
Code World Models for General Game Playing (paper [ https://substack.com/re=

FxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Large language models can play games by directly predicting moves, but this=
 often leads to illegal moves and shallow tactics, since the LLM is relying=
 on fragile pattern matching. This paper proposes an alternative: use the L=
LM to build a game simulator in code (Python) from the game=E2=80=99s rules=
 and history. In other words, the LLM writes a formal Code World Model (CWM=
) that includes functions for state transitions, legal moves, and win condi=
tions, which can then be used by classical planning algorithms like MCTS (M=
onte Carlo Tree Search). The LLM also generates heuristic value and inferen=
ce functions to guide search and handle hidden information games.
Advantages of CWM: (1) Verifiability =E2=80=93 the generated code serves as=
 an executable rule-book, so a planner can reliably enumerate valid moves (=
no illegal moves). (2) Strategic Depth =E2=80=93 combines the LLM=E2=80=99s=
 semantic understanding of the game with deep lookahead from tree search, y=
ielding more strategic play. (3) Generalization =E2=80=93 by focusing on da=
ta-to-code translation, the method adapts to new games easily; the LLM does=
n=E2=80=99t need retraining for each new game, just prompts to produce new =
simulators.
In experiments on 10 different games (5 perfect-information board games and=
 5 partial-information card games, including 4 novel games), the CWM approa=
ch matched or outperformed a strong baseline (Gemini 2.5 Pro) in 9 out of 1=
0 games. Generating an explicit world model thus proved to be an effective =
strategy for general game-playing with LLMs.
Memory Forcing: Spatio-Temporal Memory for Consistent Scene Generation on M=
inecraft (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/a71f2546-291e-4e78-bbd2-010=
17dc391e9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPO=
w0 ])
Problem: Autoregressive video models (like diffusion models) can simulate o=
pen-world gameplay (e.g. Minecraft), but face a trade-off in long-term cons=
istency. They must generate novel content when exploring new areas, yet pre=
serve details when returning to previously seen areas. With a finite contex=
t window, relying only on recent temporal memory means the model forgets ol=
der locations (losing spatial consistency). Conversely, incorporating a spa=
tial memory (maps of past areas) can improve consistency but might harm cre=
ativity if the model clings to incomplete past info.
Memory Forcing is a training framework that tackles this by coupling new tr=
aining protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory module. It uses Hyb=
rid Training to expose the model to two regimes: exploration (model learns =
to use just temporal memory to handle new unseen terrain) and revisiting (m=
odel learns to incorporate the spatial memory when returning to known terra=
in). It also introduces Chained Forward Training, where the model generates=
 longer rollouts during training; this forces it to experience larger viewp=
oint changes and learn to rely on spatial memory for maintaining consistenc=
y over long sequences. The spatial memory itself is implemented as an effic=
ient 3D point-based cache: a point-to-frame retrieval maps currently visibl=
e blocks back to the frames where they first appeared, and an incremental 3=
D reconstruction updates an explicit world map as the model generates frame=
s.
Results: Across various Minecraft environments, Memory Forcing achieved muc=
h better long-term spatial consistency (the generated world stays coherent =
over time) and higher visual quality, without increasing the computational =
cost for long videos. In effect, the model can remember and rebuild earlier=
 explored structures correctly when they come back into view, while still i=
magining new content beyond the known map =E2=80=93 all within a fixed cont=
ext length.
Taming Imperfect Process Verifiers: A Sampling Perspective on Backtracking =
(paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/3fd10f92-cebc-436c-a745-f9a950f26878=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Large language models augmented with a process verifier (a learned model th=
at judges each reasoning step) hold promise for complex reasoning, but are =
fragile. Even a high-quality verifier will make occasional mistakes =E2=80=
=93 and those small verifier errors can snowball into catastrophic failures=
 if the generation blindly trusts the verifier at each step. This error amp=
lification problem means naive =E2=80=9Cverify-as-you-go=E2=80=9D decoding =
can perform worse than expected once the cost of training the verifier is c=
onsidered.
This paper asks whether smarter decoding can mitigate verifier flaws. It in=
troduces VGB, a Verifier-Guided Backtracking algorithm that treats text gen=
eration as a stochastic search through a tree of partial solutions. Rather =
than irrevocably committing to a bad step, the model can backtrack probabil=
istically when the verifier signals an issue. VGB provides a theoretical gu=
arantee of greater robustness to verifier errors by leveraging principles f=
rom random walk algorithms. In fact, the authors draw parallels to the clas=
sic Sinclair=E2=80=93Jerrum random walk approach from approximate sampling =
theory, generalizing that idea to the setting of guided text generation.
Empirically, VGB outperformed baseline decoding strategies on both syntheti=
c tasks and real language benchmarks, across various metrics of solution qu=
ality. This suggests that, with an imperfect process verifier, a carefully =
designed backtracking sampler can =E2=80=9Ctame=E2=80=9D the verifier=E2=80=
=99s weaknesses =E2=80=93 extracting better reasoning performance than stan=
dard greedy or beam search decoding. The work highlights the importance of =
viewing reasoning as a search problem, where algorithmic advances (not just=
 model scale) can yield leaps in capability.

tory. In other words, the LLM writes a formal </span><strong>Code World Mod=

utoregressive video models (like diffusion models) can simulate open-world =
gameplay (e.g. Minecraft), but face a trade-off in </span><strong>long-term=
 consistency</strong><span>. They must generate novel content when explorin=
g new areas, yet preserve details when returning to previously seen areas. =
With a finite context window, relying only on recent </span><em>temporal me=
mory</em><span> means the model forgets older locations (losing spatial con=
sistency). Conversely, incorporating a </span><em>spatial memory</em><span>=
 (maps of past areas) can improve consistency but might harm creativity if =
the model clings to incomplete past info.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=

mory Forcing</strong><span> is a training framework that tackles this by co=
upling new </span><strong>training protocols</strong><span> with a geometry=

: </span><em>exploration</em><span> (model learns to use just temporal memo=
ry to handle new unseen terrain) and </span><em>revisiting</em><span> (mode=
l learns to incorporate the spatial memory when returning to known terrain)=
. It also introduces </span><strong>Chained Forward Training</strong><span>=
, where the model generates longer rollouts during training; this forces it=
 to experience larger viewpoint changes and learn to rely on spatial memory=
 for maintaining consistency over long sequences. The spatial memory itself=
 is implemented as an efficient </span><em>3D point-based cache</em><span>:=
 a </span><strong>point-to-frame retrieval</strong><span> maps currently vi=
sible blocks back to the frames where they first appeared, and an </span><s=
