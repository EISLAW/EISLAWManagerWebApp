PAKISTAN’S BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA [3]
MUCH WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH CHINA CHALLENGES THE U.S. MILITARILY.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
Amid the intensifying U.S.-China competition, Pakistan occupies a unique geopolitical position: It is the only country that maintains deep, long-standing relations with both Washington and Beijing, so
it is balancing the two accordingly – a process made possible by America’s need to reach an accommodation with China. But Pakistan’s balancing act will be much more difficult if China continues
to challenge the U.S. militarily.
Advisers to Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, have reportedly proposed to U.S. officials that Washington help build and operate a new port on the Arabian Sea, according to an Oct. 3
report from The Financial Times. The project supposedly intends to transform the southwestern coastal town of Pasni into a terminal for exporting Pakistan’s critical minerals. The plan estimates
that the port, which would be linked by rail to the country’s resource-rich interior, would cost $1.2 billion. One of the advisers framed the initiative as a pragmatic maneuver to “diversify from
China,” noting that “consulting the Chinese isn’t necessary as the site lies outside the Gwadar [port] concession.”

It’s unclear whether the U.S. will accept this proposal. Much will depend on the value of Pakistan’s critical mineral deposits. But it is clear why Pakistan would extend the offer. For the past
two or so decades, U.S.-Pakistani relations have been defined by strategic mistrust born of the post-9/11 wars. While Pakistan was formally a major non-NATO ally and a key recipient of U.S. security
assistance, its regional strategy clashed with Washington’s counterterrorism and state-building objectives, anchored as they were in managing Afghanistan and countering India. The U.S. campaign to
remake Afghanistan forced Pakistan into a structural dilemma: It could neither fully meet American expectations of partnership nor fully abandon its Afghan Taliban proxies. As the war bled into
Pakistan through drone strikes, unilateral U.S. actions and a ferocious Taliban insurgency within its borders, bilateral ties were relegated to tactical cooperation.
During this time, U.S. relations with Pakistan’s rival, India, deepened significantly as their strategic objectives aligned. Washington cultivated a comprehensive partnership grounded in shared
geopolitical, economic and technological interests. Successive Democratic and Republican administrations institutionalized defense trade, intelligence cooperation and joint military exercises while
broadening collaboration in space, cyber and advanced technologies. The U.S. increasingly viewed India as a pivotal counterweight to China’s expanding influence in the Indo-Pacific.
Pakistan thus faced the prospect of strategic encirclement on its western and eastern flanks. Confronted with this dilemma, Islamabad moved to improve its partnership with China, which it saw as its
most viable partner for safeguarding security, maintaining regional influence and preserving leverage with the U.S. Its strategic pivot involved forging closer economic and military ties with Beijing,
most prominently through the 2010s launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the flagship Belt and Road Initiative project worth tens of billions of dollars connecting China’s western
periphery to Pakistan’s Indian Ocean coast via highways, railways and energy infrastructure. By the mid-2020s, China had also emerged as Pakistan’s primary arms supplier, meeting roughly 81
percent of its defense procurement requirements.
This dynamic in South Asia is unusual, given the historical trajectories, strategic imperatives and constraints of the four states involved. Though publicly non-aligned during the Cold War, India
effectively pursued a pro-Soviet orientation, leveraging political, military and economic ties with Moscow to counterbalance China and Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan’s post-9/11 relationship with the
U.S. reflected a long-standing alignment, rooted in decades of cooperation through U.S.-led security frameworks such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization and
support in the Soviet conflict in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Most strikingly, Pakistan managed to sustain meaningful relationships with both the U.S. and China, navigating great-power waters to
preserve its strategic autonomy.
In fact, Pakistan was a pivotal intermediary in the 1971 U.S.-China rapprochement, secretly facilitating former national security adviser Henry Kissinger’s historic visit to Beijing. At former
President Richard Nixon’s request, then-Pakistani leader Gen. Yahya Khan served as a discreet channel between Washington and Beijing, relaying messages that led to Kissinger’s covert flight from
Islamabad to Beijing under the guise of illness. This successful mediation not only enabled Nixon’s landmark visit to China but also elevated Pakistan’s international stature, cementing its
position as a trusted partner of both the U.S. and China.
One of the reasons Pakistan was able to position itself so well lies in the strategic logic of the Cold War, when China was nowhere near the powerhouse it is today. The Soviet Union was always
Washington’s principal adversary; China was seen as a secondary but progressively useful counterweight. Beijing’s ideological challenge to Moscow’s leadership of the communist world opened a
window for U.S. engagement. The 1969 clashes along the Ussuri River between the two crystallized this opportunity, allowing Washington to leverage Pakistan’s relationship with China as a diplomatic
bridge in its emerging triangular strategy.
The normalization of U.S.-China relations, marked by expanding investment and technology exchanges, galvanized Pakistan’s ability to sustain productive ties with both powers. From Islamabad’s
perspective, however, Washington remained the more consequential partner, a fact that shaped its security and economic strategy for decades. Even as China’s rise redefined global power hierarchies
and coincided with a downturn in U.S.-Pakistan relations, Islamabad managed to avoid being strategically trapped between its two major patrons. Its delicate balancing act was made possible in part by
its structural vulnerabilities – chronic economic fragility, political volatility and security dependence – which tethered it simultaneously to both Washington and Beijing.
In other words, neither Washington nor Beijing perceives Pakistan’s engagement with the other as an immediate strategic threat. However, the Trump administration’s revised global geostrategy,
which emphasizes the empowerment of allies and partners to manage their own regions, has not only revitalized U.S.-Pakistan relations but also enabled Islamabad to sustain its delicate balance between
the two great powers. What further strengthens Pakistan’s position is Washington’s urgency in establishing a workable framework with China on economic competition rather than allowing its rivalry
to become an outright confrontation. This recalibration has, in turn, diminished Washington’s reliance on New Delhi as its primary counterweight to Beijing, a shift that benefits Islamabad both in
its enduring rivalry with India and within this evolving four-player strategic matrix.
It’s possible, then, that Pakistan could once again be an intermediary between Washington and Beijing, albeit in a limited capacity, leveraging its historic role as a bridge in great-power
diplomacy. However, the current geopolitical landscape is far more complex than the Cold War’s, shaped now by a systemic rivalry between two deeply interdependent yet strategically opposed powers.
The central challenge lies in China’s military assertiveness, which has made it difficult for the U.S. to compartmentalize and pursue pragmatic cooperation on trade and technology. Pakistan’s
successful use of Chinese defense systems in its 87-hour clash with India last May further complicates its balancing act, as Islamabad’s ability to maneuver between the world’s preeminent power
and its principal challenger ultimately depends on the two avoiding direct confrontation.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Amid the intensify=
ing U.S.-China competition, Pakistan occupies a unique geopolitical positio=
n: It is the only country that maintains deep, long-standing relations with=
 both Washington and Beijing, so it is balancing the two accordingly =E2=80=
=93 a process made possible by America=E2=80=99s need to reach an accommoda=
tion with China. But Pakistan=E2=80=99s balancing act will be much more dif=
ficult if China continues to challenge the U.S. militarily.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Advisers to Pakist=
an=E2=80=99s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, have reportedly proposed=
 to U.S. officials that Washington help build and operate a new port on the=
 Arabian Sea, according to an Oct. 3 report from The Financial Times. The p=
roject supposedly intends to transform the southwestern coastal town of Pas=
ni into a terminal for exporting Pakistan=E2=80=99s critical minerals. The =
plan estimates that the port, which would be linked by rail to the country=
=E2=80=99s resource-rich interior, would cost $1.2 billion. One of the advi=
sers framed the initiative as a pragmatic maneuver to =E2=80=9Cdiversify fr=
om China,=E2=80=9D noting that =E2=80=9Cconsulting the Chinese isn=E2=80=99=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s uncle=
ar whether the U.S. will accept this proposal. Much will depend on the valu=
e of Pakistan=E2=80=99s critical mineral deposits. But it is clear why Paki=
stan would extend the offer. For the past two or so decades, U.S.-Pakistani=
 relations have been defined by strategic mistrust born of the post-9/11 wa=
rs. While Pakistan was formally a major non-NATO ally and a key recipient o=
f U.S. security assistance, its regional strategy clashed with Washington=
=E2=80=99s counterterrorism and state-building objectives, anchored as they=
 were in managing Afghanistan and countering India. The U.S. campaign to re=
make Afghanistan forced Pakistan into a structural dilemma: It could neithe=
r fully meet American expectations of partnership nor fully abandon its Afg=
han Taliban proxies. As the war bled into Pakistan through drone strikes, u=
nilateral U.S. actions and a ferocious Taliban insurgency within its border=
s, bilateral ties were relegated to tactical cooperation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">During this time, =
U.S. relations with Pakistan=E2=80=99s rival, India, deepened significantly=
 as their strategic objectives aligned. Washington cultivated a comprehensi=
ve partnership grounded in shared geopolitical, economic and technological =
interests. Successive Democratic and Republican administrations institution=
alized defense trade, intelligence cooperation and joint military exercises=
 while broadening collaboration in space, cyber and advanced technologies. =
The U.S. increasingly viewed India as a pivotal counterweight to China=E2=
=80=99s expanding influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Pakistan thus face=
d the prospect of strategic encirclement on its western and eastern flanks.=
 Confronted with this dilemma, Islamabad moved to improve its partnership w=
ith China, which it saw as its most viable partner for safeguarding securit=
y, maintaining regional influence and preserving leverage with the U.S. Its=
 strategic pivot involved forging closer economic and military ties with Be=
ijing, most prominently through the 2010s launch of the China-Pakistan Econ=
omic Corridor, the flagship Belt and Road Initiative project worth tens of =
billions of dollars connecting China=E2=80=99s western periphery to Pakista=
n=E2=80=99s Indian Ocean coast via highways, railways and energy infrastruc=
ture. By the mid-2020s, China had also emerged as Pakistan=E2=80=99s primar=
y arms supplier, meeting roughly 81 percent of its defense procurement requ=
irements.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This dynamic in So=
uth Asia is unusual, given the historical trajectories, strategic imperativ=
es and constraints of the four states involved. Though publicly non-aligned=
 during the Cold War, India effectively pursued a pro-Soviet orientation, l=
everaging political, military and economic ties with Moscow to counterbalan=
ce China and Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan=E2=80=99s post-9/11 relationship=
 with the U.S. reflected a long-standing alignment, rooted in decades of co=
operation through U.S.-led security frameworks such as the Southeast Asia T=
reaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization and support in the S=
oviet conflict in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Most strikingly, Pakistan manag=
ed to sustain meaningful relationships with both the U.S. and China, naviga=
ting great-power waters to preserve its strategic autonomy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In fact, Pakistan =
was a pivotal intermediary in the 1971 U.S.-China rapprochement, secretly f=
acilitating former national security adviser Henry Kissinger=E2=80=99s hist=
oric visit to Beijing. At former President Richard Nixon=E2=80=99s request,=
 then-Pakistani leader Gen. Yahya Khan served as a discreet channel between=
 Washington and Beijing, relaying messages that led to Kissinger=E2=80=99s =
covert flight from Islamabad to Beijing under the guise of illness. This su=
ccessful mediation not only enabled Nixon=E2=80=99s landmark visit to China=
 but also elevated Pakistan=E2=80=99s international stature, cementing its =
position as a trusted partner of both the U.S. and China.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">One of the reasons=
 Pakistan was able to position itself so well lies in the strategic logic o=
f the Cold War, when China was nowhere near the powerhouse it is today. The=
 Soviet Union was always Washington=E2=80=99s principal adversary; China wa=
s seen as a secondary but progressively useful counterweight. Beijing=E2=80=
=99s ideological challenge to Moscow=E2=80=99s leadership of the communist =
world opened a window for U.S. engagement. The 1969 clashes along the Ussur=
i River between the two crystallized this opportunity, allowing Washington =
to leverage Pakistan=E2=80=99s relationship with China as a diplomatic brid=
ge in its emerging triangular strategy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The normalization =
of U.S.-China relations, marked by expanding investment and technology exch=
anges, galvanized Pakistan=E2=80=99s ability to sustain productive ties wit=
h both powers. From Islamabad=E2=80=99s perspective, however, Washington re=
mained the more consequential partner, a fact that shaped its security and =
economic strategy for decades. Even as China=E2=80=99s rise redefined globa=
l power hierarchies and coincided with a downturn in U.S.-Pakistan relation=
s, Islamabad managed to avoid being strategically trapped between its two m=
ajor patrons. Its delicate balancing act was made possible in part by its s=
tructural vulnerabilities =E2=80=93 chronic economic fragility, political v=
olatility and security dependence =E2=80=93 which tethered it simultaneousl=
y to both Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In other words, ne=
ither Washington nor Beijing perceives Pakistan=E2=80=99s engagement with t=
he other as an immediate strategic threat. However, the Trump administratio=
n=E2=80=99s revised global geostrategy, which emphasizes the empowerment of=
 allies and partners to manage their own regions, has not only revitalized =
U.S.-Pakistan relations but also enabled Islamabad to sustain its delicate =
balance between the two great powers. What further strengthens Pakistan=E2=
=80=99s position is Washington=E2=80=99s urgency in establishing a workable=
 framework with China on economic competition rather than allowing its riva=
lry to become an outright confrontation. This recalibration has, in turn, d=
iminished Washington=E2=80=99s reliance on New Delhi as its primary counter=
weight to Beijing, a shift that benefits Islamabad both in its enduring riv=
alry with India and within this evolving four-player strategic matrix.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s possi=
ble, then, that Pakistan could once again be an intermediary between Washin=
gton and Beijing, albeit in a limited capacity, leveraging its historic rol=
e as a bridge in great-power diplomacy. However, the current geopolitical l=
andscape is far more complex than the Cold War=E2=80=99s, shaped now by a s=
ystemic rivalry between two deeply interdependent yet strategically opposed=
 powers. The central challenge lies in China=E2=80=99s military assertivene=
ss, which has made it difficult for the U.S. to compartmentalize and pursue=
 pragmatic cooperation on trade and technology. Pakistan=E2=80=99s successf=
ul use of Chinese defense systems in its 87-hour clash with India last May =
further complicates its balancing act, as Islamabad=E2=80=99s ability to ma=
neuver between the world=E2=80=99s preeminent power and its principal chall=
enger ultimately depends on the two avoiding direct confrontation.</p>
