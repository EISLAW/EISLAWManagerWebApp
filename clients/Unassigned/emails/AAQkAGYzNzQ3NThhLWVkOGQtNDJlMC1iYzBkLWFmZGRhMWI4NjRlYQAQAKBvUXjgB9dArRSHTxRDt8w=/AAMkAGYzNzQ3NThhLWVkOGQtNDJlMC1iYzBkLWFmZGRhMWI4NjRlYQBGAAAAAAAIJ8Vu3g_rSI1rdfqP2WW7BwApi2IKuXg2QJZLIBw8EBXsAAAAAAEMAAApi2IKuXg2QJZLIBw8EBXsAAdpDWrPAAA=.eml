I've been writing about prompting for over a year now, building sophisticat=
ed systems that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
In "Nate's Secret Sauce" [ https://substack.com/redirect/e861b40f-75b9-4b8c=
-a649-fc780040a9ba?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ], I showed you how to iterate across multiple models=E2=80=941=
9 prompts, hours of refinement, fighting for every inch of truth. In "My Pr=
ompt Stack for Work" [ https://substack.com/redirect/d92c610a-95b6-4886-837=
5-5228b6a619fe?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ], I laid out 16 architected prompts that transform daily workflows=
=2E In "Stop Letting AI Guess" [ https:=
//substack.com/redirect/addd30d3-d671-=
4463-9155-9b5aac9c831e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], I introduced contract-first prompting=E2=80=94bilateral =
agreement at 95% confidence before execution.
Here's what I discovered after talking with hundreds of CEOs, developers, a=
nd power users: I built these systems for reasoning models. They were desig=
ned for the frontier=E2=80=94for o3, for Claude Opus 4, for models that cou=
ld actually think. But nearly everyone I talked to at actual workplaces was=
 still using GPT-4o or CoPilot and wondering why even sophisticated prompts=
 felt like pushing water uphill.
This is like driving a Formula 1 car with the parking brake on.
This is the first time I'm saying it explicitly: Switch your model. Stop us=
ing GPT-4o. The prompts I've been teaching=E2=80=94the ones you've been lea=
rning=E2=80=94they were never meant for last generation's AI. They were bui=
lt for reasoning models that most people weren't using.
But here's what's even more important: For those already using reasoning mo=
dels, we're not done. We're just getting started.
The techniques in this guide have never been gathered into one place like t=
his=E2=80=94I constructed an entire prompting stack for reasoning models to=
 get you ready for ChatGPT-5. It=E2=80=99s time now, because ChatGPT-5 is g=
oing to be the first reasoning model most people use regularly. I want you =
to be ready!
Looking for examples of what's in that 60 page guide? Try parallel divergen=
ce exploration where models maintain contradictory solutions before converg=
ence. Semantic denoising through recursion that refines outputs without exp=
licit critique. Or inverse complexity scaling that reveals how reasoning mo=
dels fail catastrophically on simple tasks.=20
Sounds really complicated, but 1) I promise to explain it clearly so you ge=
t it, and 2) I give you actionable prompting takeaways for each. Yes, grasp=
ing these principles of reasoning models like ChatGPT-5 really does shift y=
our prompting when you understand them!
One warning: these are specifically not going to work well for ChatGPT 4o u=
sers, and I=E2=80=99ve avoided publishing a prompting guide specifically fo=
r reasoning models before now precisely for that reason. Now that we are al=
l on the verge of all having reasoning models, it=E2=80=99s time to go in-d=
epth on these more advanced principles.
And the timing isn't accidental. ChatGPT-5 may be hours away (fingers cross=
ed). When it launches it will become the default model for hundreds of mill=
ions of users. For the first time, the baseline might shift from pattern-ma=
tching to reasoning. People who've been stuck on GPT-4o might suddenly find=
 themselves with a reasoning model without even choosing it.
This is a rare moment. A chance for a collective paradigm shift in how we p=
rompt. But only if we're ready with techniques that actually leverage what =
reasoning models can do.
Look around the web. Find me another guide that goes this deep into prompti=
ng specifically for reasoning models. Not generic "prompt engineering tips"=
 that work across any model. Not "10 ChatGPT hacks." I mean real, tested te=
chniques for engaging in deep work with models that can genuinely reason.=
=20
The 60-page guide and this article represent something different. For those=
 still on GPT-4o, it's your migration path to the frontier. For those alrea=
dy using reasoning models, there are new techniques that will separate you =
from everyone else who just switched models but didn't evolve their prompti=
ng. And for everyone, it's preparation for the GPT-5 world that is right ar=
ound the corner.
The gap isn't just about using better models anymore. It's about understand=
ing how to prompt them to get the most out of them. And these techniques sc=
ale with reasoning model capability=E2=80=94they'll be even more powerful w=
ith GPT-5 than they are with o3.
The goal with this guide is not just to move the baseline on prompting. We'=
re expanding the frontier of prompting as we all get reasoner models. And I=
=E2=80=99m dropping this piece now because it feels as close as I can get t=
o =E2=80=9Cright before ChatGPT-5=E2=80=9D (if I=E2=80=99m lucky you=E2=80=
=99ll have it in your hands today).
Come have a look at how to prompt for the future=E2=80=A6
PS. One more thing: if you=E2=80=99re a Gemini or Claude fan you=E2=80=99re=
 not left out here! These principles scale with Opus 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, =
and I dive into both those models in the 60 page guide as well!

Go beyond 4o: The Journey to a New  AI Paradigm in the GPT-5 Era
You're using the wrong AI model.
I know because I've talked with hundreds of CEOs, developers, and "AI power=
 users" in the last month. Nearly every single one defaults to ChatGPT 4o. =
They think it's the best because "4 is bigger than 3" and ChatGPT is obviou=
sly the leader.
They're not entirely wrong. But they're missing something fundamental about=
 where AI has gone in 2025.
Here's what I've come to understand: If you're still using GPT-4o as your d=
aily driver in August 2025, you're experiencing maybe 40% of what modern AI=
 can actually deliver. It's not that GPT-4o is bad=E2=80=94it's that the re=
asoning models have fundamentally changed what's possible, and most people =
haven't noticed yet.
The numbers tell a story that's hard to ignore. OpenAI o3 makes 20 percent =
fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks. Claude Op=
us 4.1 achieves 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, solving actual engineering pro=

Humanity's Last Exam=E2=80=94a dataset designed by hundreds of subject matt=
er experts to capture the frontier of human knowledge and reasoning.
These aren't incremental improvements. They represent a different category =
of capability.
This article is the companion piece to my comprehensive guide to prompting =
in 2025 [ https://substack.com/redirect/8a4f0b50-057c-4496-87e6-0b5d0ee5a79=

=80=94if you want the full technical deep-dive with vendor comparisons and =
academic research, that's your resource. Here, I'm exploring what these cha=
nges actually mean for how we work with AI.
FAQ: Is This Guide ChatGPT-5 Ready?
Yes. Emphatically yes.
I wrote this guide specifically anticipating ChatGPT-5 and the wave of mode=
l releases coming in the second half of 2025. The techniques here=E2=80=94m=
ultiple solution generation, meta-prompting, program of thought=E2=80=94the=
se aren't hacks for today's models. They're principles that get more powerf=
ul as models get more capable.
Think about it: Asking a model to generate multiple solutions and check the=
m for consistency works better with smarter models, not worse. Meta-prompti=
ng=E2=80=94having the model help you improve your prompts=E2=80=94scales di=
rectly with model intelligence. The smarter the model, the better advice it=
 can give about how to use it.
What I'm teaching here isn't how to trick current models into working bette=
r. I'm teaching you how to collaborate with reasoning systems. As these sys=
tems get more sophisticated, these collaboration patterns become more valua=
ble, not less.
The shift from constraining models with detailed instructions to letting th=
em use their internal reasoning? That's exactly the direction we're heading=
=2E GPT-5 won't need more hand-holdi=
ng than o3=E2=80=94it will need less. But=
 it will reward those who understand how to engage with its reasoning capab=
ilities rather than just its text generation.
Every technique in this guide is designed to scale up, not become obsolete.=
 That's the entire point.
The Three Models That Changed Everything
After months of testing and conversations with people pushing these tools t=
o their limits, three models consistently emerge as game-changers. Each rep=
resents a different philosophy about what AI should be.
ChatGPT o3: The Reasoning Machine
OpenAI o3 fascinates me because it represents OpenAI's bet on what they cal=
l "thinking models"=E2=80=94AI that takes time to reason through problems b=
efore responding. It doesn't just answer; it explores. The model can agenti=
cally use and combine every tool within ChatGPT: searching the web, analyzi=
ng uploaded files with Python, reasoning about visual inputs, even generati=
ng images.
I watched o3 tackle a travel forecast question recently. It didn't just sea=
rch once and give up. The model ran 15 different searches, found data for J=
anuary and March, recognized February was missing, then dug into tariff imp=
acts, border issues, school breaks, airline discount seasons, even NBA fina=
ls timing to estimate the gap. That's not pattern matching=E2=80=94that's s=
omething approaching actual research methodology.
The personality shift is noticeable. Where GPT-4o feels conversational and =
eager to please, o3 is analytical, almost terse. It reminds me of working w=
ith a brilliant but focused researcher who doesn't do small talk.
(A note on timing: August 7th might bring ChatGPT 5, which could change thi=
s calculation entirely. Sam Altman has indicated o3 and o4-mini may be Open=
AI's last stand-alone reasoning models before GPT-5, a model that the compa=
ny says will unify traditional models with reasoning capabilities. If you'r=
e reading this after August 7th and GPT-5 exists, try that first.)
Claude Opus 4.1: The Marathon Runner
What strikes me most about Claude Opus 4.1 isn't just its benchmark scores=
=E2=80=94though 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified is genuinely impressive. It's t=
he endurance. Claude can maintain context and coherence across hours of wor=
k. Not minutes. Hours.
I've used Claude to refactor entire codebases over multiple sessions, watch=
ing it remember decisions from three hours earlier and apply them consisten=
tly. With 32K output token support, it can generate entire applications in =
a single response, adapting to your coding style as it goes.
But the real differentiator is transparency. Claude shows its thinking proc=
ess=E2=80=94not because you asked, but because Anthropic built it that way.=
 You see it searching, evaluating options, reconsidering. It's oddly reassu=
ring, like having a colleague who thinks out loud. Sometimes that transpare=
ncy reveals fascinating insights about how these models actually process in=
formation.
GitHub notes that Claude Opus 4.1 improves across most capabilities relativ=
e to Opus 4, with particularly notable performance gains in multi-file code=
 refactoring. When you need sustained, complex work with visible reasoning,=
 Claude stands alone.
Gemini 2.5 Pro: The Knowledge Synthesizer
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro breaks the rules with its 1-million token context w=
indow. To put that in perspective, that's roughly 750,000 words=E2=80=94sev=
eral novels worth of text that the model can hold in its "mind" simultaneou=
sly.
I've experimented with feeding Gemini entire technical specifications, year=
s of documentation, complete email archives. The model doesn't just store t=
his information=E2=80=94it finds patterns and contradictions across hundred=
s of thousands of tokens that would take humans weeks to identify.
On benchmarks, 2.5 Pro leads without using expensive test-time techniques. =
It scores at the top on GPQA and AIME 2025 for math and science. But benchm=
arks don't capture what it feels like to have a model that can genuinely sy=
nthesize vast amounts of information into coherent insights.
The personality is notably different too=E2=80=94professional, concise, alm=
ost academic. Where Claude might write you a paragraph, Gemini gives you th=
e essential points. It feels designed for people who value precision over p=
ersonality.
Why Prompting Changed (And Nobody Told You)
Here's what I've slowly realized: The prompting techniques that everyone le=
arned in 2023 are now actively harmful. We're using combustion engine techn=
iques on electric vehicles.
The old wisdom was to guide the model step-by-step, to constrain its thinki=
ng, to be explicit about reasoning chains. But these reasoning models alrea=
dy do that internally=E2=80=94often better than we can guide them. When you=
 tell o3 to "think step by step," you're constraining its more sophisticate=
d internal reasoning to fit your simpler framework.
What works now is fundamentally different.
The Power of Multiple Perspectives
Instead of asking for the answer, I've started asking for multiple answers =
and then having the model find consistencies. It's a simple shift with prof=
ound results.
Rather than "What's the solution to this problem?" I now ask: "Generate 5 d=
ifferent approaches to solving this problem, then identify which elements a=
ppear consistently across all approaches."
In my testing, this reduced errors by 15-20%. The models are probabilistic=
=E2=80=94they sample from possibility space. By forcing multiple samples an=
d then analyzing them, you're essentially running a mini peer-review proces=
s inside a single query.
Code as Reasoning
Here's something counterintuitive: For any problem involving calculation or=
 precise logic, I no longer ask the model to explain. I ask it to write cod=
e.
Instead of "Calculate the compound interest on $80,000 at 3.7% annually for=
 23 years," I say "Write a Python function to calculate the compound intere=
st on $80,000 at 3.7% annually for 23 years, then execute it."
The results are dramatic. O3 achieves 99.5% accuracy on AIME 2025 when give=
n access to a Python interpreter. The structure of code forces precision th=
at natural language allows to slip.
Planning as Commitment
I've noticed something interesting: When models create a plan first, they f=
ollow it more faithfully than when they dive straight into execution. It's =
not about the plan being perfect=E2=80=94it's about creating cognitive comm=
itment.
"First, create a detailed outline for a blog post about renewable energy, i=
ncluding key points and data needed. Then write the post following that out=
line."
The plan becomes a contract the model makes with itself. It's less likely t=
o drift or forget important elements when it has already mapped the path.
The Architecture of Effective Prompts
After analyzing thousands of prompts, including Claude's own system prompt,=
 I've noticed something striking: The actual instruction=E2=80=94what you w=
ant=E2=80=94is maybe 30% of an effective prompt. The rest is scaffolding.
Consider edge cases. Your prompt needs to anticipate failure modes. These m=
odels are powerful but they're not omniscient. They need fallback behaviors=
=2E
I've started including passages like: "If unable to find specific data, pro=
vide estimates with clear disclaimers. If the request is ambiguous, list as=
sumptions before proceeding. If multiple interpretations exist, briefly ack=
nowledge them and proceed with the most likely."
Claude's system prompt is 90% guardrails and edge cases. That's not overcau=
tiousness=E2=80=94that's engineering for reliability.
There's also the matter of attention. These models don't read prompts unifo=
rmly. They weight the beginning and end more heavily=E2=80=94it's how the a=
ttention mechanisms work. So I structure prompts with critical instructions=
 in the first 10%, supporting information in the middle, and key constraint=
s in the final 10%.
Perhaps most surprisingly, negative examples work better than positive ones=
=2E Telling a model what not to do is m=
ore powerful than showing what to do.=20=
"Never use phrases like 'synergistic,' 'leverage,' or 'innovative solutions=
'" is more effective than "Write in a professional tone." The models have s=
een millions of bad examples in their training. Explicitly flagging those p=
atterns helps them avoid them.
The Meta-Prompting Revolution
Here's the insight that changed how I work with these models: They understa=
nd themselves better than we understand them.
I've started asking models to help me prompt them better. It sounds recursi=
ve, maybe even absurd, but it works.
Try asking: "Here's my current prompt: [your prompt]. How would you improve=
 this to get better results from you?"
The model will reveal capabilities and limitations you didn't know existed.=
 It's like having the manual written by the machine itself.
Or push further: "What parts of this request are unclear or ambiguous? What=
 assumptions are you making?"
This surfaces hidden uncertainties that would otherwise lead to hallucinati=
ons or errors. The model becomes a collaborator in its own optimization.
Sometimes I go even more abstract: "How would you approach this if you had =
no constraints? What would be your ideal process?"
The responses reveal fascinating insights about how these models conceptual=
ize problems. Sometimes they imagine capabilities they don't have (ignore t=
hose), but often they suggest genuinely novel approaches.
What This Means for the Future
The gap between people using GPT-4o and those using reasoning models isn't =
just about capability=E2=80=94it's about worldview. GPT-4o users are still =
in the paradigm of "AI as a smart autocomplete." Reasoning model users have=
 moved to "AI as a thinking partner."
The economics are shifting too. OpenAI cut o3's API cost by 80%. Claude and=
 Gemini prices continue to drop. These aren't luxury tools anymore=E2=80=94=
they're becoming infrastructure. The question isn't whether you can afford =
to use them, but whether you can afford not to.
But here's what really interests me: We're seeing the emergence of models t=
hat don't just process prompts but engage with them. They question, they ex=
plore, they reconsider. The line between tool and collaborator is blurring.
A Path Forward
If you're still using GPT-4o, you're not wrong=E2=80=94you're just early to=
 being late. These models served us well, but the landscape has shifted.
Start with task-matching. Research requiring current data and tool use? Tha=
t's o3's domain. Sustained work requiring hours of focus? Claude Opus 4.1 w=
as built for that. Massive document synthesis? Gemini 2.5 Pro has no equal.
Rewrite your core prompts using multiple solution generation, explicit edge=
 case handling, and negative examples. But more importantly, start thinking=
 of prompts as conversations, not commands.
Experiment with meta-prompting. Ask the model to improve your prompts, iden=
tify ambiguities, suggest approaches. You're not just using the model=E2=80=
=94you're collaborating with it.

The shift from GPT-4o to reasoning models isn't just an upgrade=E2=80=94it'=
s a paradigm shift. We're moving from models that complete our thoughts to =
models that can actually think. The question isn't whether to make the swit=
ch, but whether you'll do it before or after your competition.
In six months, even o3 and Claude Opus 4.1 will likely seem primitive compa=
red to what's coming. But here's the critical insight: The winners won't be=
 those who memorized the perfect prompt format for a specific model. They'l=
l be those who learned these fundamental principles of working with reasoni=
ng systems. The techniques I've shared=E2=80=94self-consistency, program of=
 thought, meta-prompting=E2=80=94these aren't tricks that will become obsol=
ete. They're principles that will become more powerful as models evolve.
The future isn't about perfect prompts. It's about understanding that these=
 models are becoming reasoning partners, not just text generators. Those wh=
o grasp this shift will thrive. Those who don't will wonder why AI never li=
ved up to the hype.
The choice, as always, is yours.

t takes time to reason through problems before responding. It doesn't just =
answer; it explores. The model can agentically use and combine every tool w=

ed o3 tackle a travel forecast question recently. It didn't just search onc=
e and give up. The model ran 15 different searches, found data for January =
and March, recognized February was missing, then dug into tariff impacts, b=
order issues, school breaks, airline discount seasons, even NBA finals timi=

cores=E2=80=94though 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified is genuinely impressive. I=
t's the endurance. Claude can maintain context and coherence across hours o=

three hours earlier and apply them consistently. With 32K output token supp=

your coding style as it goes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=

sked, but because Anthropic built it that way. You see it searching, evalua=

 who thinks out loud. Sometimes that transparency reveals fascinating insig=

4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">After analyzing thousands of p=
rompts, including Claude's own system prompt, I've noticed something striki=
ng: The actual instruction=E2=80=94what you want=E2=80=94is maybe 30% of an=
 effective prompt. The rest is scaffolding.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Consider edge c=
ases. Your prompt needs to anticipate failure modes. These models are power=
ful but they're not omniscient. They need fallback behaviors.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">I've started including passages like: &quot;If unable to find specific=
 data, provide estimates with clear disclaimers. If the request is ambiguou=
s, list assumptions before proceeding. If multiple interpretations exist, b=
riefly acknowledge them and proceed with the most likely.&quot;</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
There's also the matter of attention. These models don't read prompts unifo=
rmly. They weight the beginning and end more heavily=E2=80=94it's how the a=
ttention mechanisms work. So I structure prompts with critical instructions=
 in the first 10%, supporting information in the middle, and key constraint=
s in the final 10%.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Perhaps most surprisingly, negative exa=
mples work better than positive ones. Telling a model what not to do is mor=
e powerful than showing what to do. &quot;Never use phrases like 'synergist=
ic,' 'leverage,' or 'innovative solutions'&quot; is more effective than &qu=
ot;Write in a professional tone.&quot; The models have seen millions of bad=
 examples in their training. Explicitly flagging those patterns helps them =
avoid them.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative=
