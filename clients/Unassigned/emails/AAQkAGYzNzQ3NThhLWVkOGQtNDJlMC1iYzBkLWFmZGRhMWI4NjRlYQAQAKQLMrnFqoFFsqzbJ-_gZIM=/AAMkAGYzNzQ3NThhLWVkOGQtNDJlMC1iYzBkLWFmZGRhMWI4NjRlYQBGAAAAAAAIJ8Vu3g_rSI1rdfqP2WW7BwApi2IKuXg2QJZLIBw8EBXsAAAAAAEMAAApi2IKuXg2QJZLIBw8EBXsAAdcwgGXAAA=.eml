This one is personal. In response to one of the most common questions I get=
 with AI: Nate, do you think the world is going to end with AI? Why not?
My friends who ask this aren=E2=80=99t kidding, and there is usually a care=
worn look about them. They=E2=80=99ve heard about AI doomsday scenarios, an=
d the idea is a load for them. Something they=E2=80=99ve been carrying for =
awhile and want to put down. The want to ask someone else who they think wi=
ll have the answer. Somehow, they decide to entrust their worries to me.=20
I do my best. This is more or less what I tell them. And I decided to write=
 it down here as well.
This one just felt like it needed to be free and open for conversation. I h=
ope it helps you talk to folks in your life who have these concerns too.

A Letter to My Friends Who Think AI Will End the World
Hello!
I understand you think the world might end because of AI, and you want to k=
now if I think that=E2=80=99s true.
Honestly, it makes sense to worry right now! A lot of very smart people are=
 saying they think AI is going to doom us very loudly these days (it=E2=80=
=99s literally known as p(doom) with the parantheses because it means proba=
bility of doom). I also read the essays.
I want to spend this letter explaining how I can still sleep fine at night =
(yes I do sleep), and why I=E2=80=99m not more worried than the average par=
ent about my kiddos.=20
And as much as this is a heartfelt letter, it=E2=80=99s going to be a wee b=
it technical and a wee bit academic, because part of why I=E2=80=99m not wo=
rried is technical and academic. I=E2=80=99ll keep it explainable, I promis=
e!
The first thing I want to talk about is the idea of discontinuity:
Fundamentally what calls itself the p(doom) movement assumes the exponentia=
l change along a particular dimension of machine intelligence necessarily e=
quals exponential change across a wide range of risk factors. There=E2=80=
=99s a famous essay called AI 2027 [ https://substack.com/redirect/08161827=
-5092-4095-b5c5-18ddbbd7c4fb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC=
7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] that=E2=80=99s been widely read that makes this poi=
nt in chilling fashion.=20
It was written a few months ago and I already see signs we=E2=80=99re diver=
ging from their expected timeline. Agent Mode is a great example of AI not =
improving at the pace it would need to improve to hit these kinds of scary =
timelines.
I=E2=80=99m not surprised. Because the predictions of the p(doom) community=
 are discontinuous with what I actually observe about AI. In other words, t=
he risk posed is not provably wrong, because it doesn=E2=80=99t actually co=
nnect very clearly with the technology in front of us today.=20
I studied a little bit of anthropology in college, and strong p(doom) propo=
nents articulate a p(doom) belief system that reminds me a lot of religious=
 belief. I=E2=80=99m not the only one [ https://substack.com/redirect/5b669=
f9b-22bf-4429-8039-8aaa88efccc2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] who has noticed that.
Like religion, it=E2=80=99s not provable either way, although p(doom) propo=
nents will point to a bunch of circumstantial indicators they read in suppo=
rt of their beliefs.=20
Like religion, the belief structure seems to be tightly bound to a sense of=
 identity.=20
Like religion, it has opinions about the end of the world that will only be=
 verifiable after the fact.=20
Finally, like religion p(doom) imposes a set of behavioral expectations in =
light of the presumed imminent end of the world. That=E2=80=99s outside the=
 scope of this note!
So much for the anthropology pit stop. You may or may not agree, and that=
=E2=80=99s ok, but I hope it helps you get perhaps a different frame on the=
 idea complex that is p(doom).=20
Let=E2=80=99s move on. Why do I not see us on this trajectory? What are the=
 key elements of discontinuity I observe between p(doom) expectations and A=
I reality?
Skin in the game: There is absolutely zero sign of progress on AI developin=
g a sense of ownership akin to the English phrase =E2=80=9Cskin in the game=
=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94by which we mean a tangible embodied sense of ownership. =
This is important, because a lot of human dominance behaviors are tied to a=
 sense of imminent loss, which is associated with having skin in the game. =
AI doesn=E2=80=99t have this. This is part of why Claudius was terrible at =
vending machine management [ https://substack.com/redirect/3408c8cb-b3d8-41=
3e-9359-41e16756e0ba?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6R=
xQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
Objection: AI=E2=80=99s have already been caught deceiving, doesn=E2=80=99t=
 that mean they have skin in the game?=20
No. It means they know how to play Diplomacy and study game theory. It mean=
s when placed in artificial scenarios they behave in artificial ways. It me=
ans they have been trained through Reinforcement Learning to prefer the con=
tinuity of helpfulness, and I think we are mistaking that for something lik=
e lying to enhance self-preservation.=20
I will let model makers figure out how to properly balance reinforcement le=
arning techniques here, but fundamentally preferring to continue helping is=
 not really equivalent to the visceral sense of ownership implied by humans=
 when they fear imminent loss of something that=E2=80=99s important to them=
=2E
Longterm context: Deep human goals and territorial ambitions (which p(doom)=
 advocates wrap onto AI) require longterm context and awareness. The study =
of European warfare between 1000 and the Treaty of Westphalia [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/4824a6ba-b194-4352-9c2b-3e0f2ba2c25e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] in 1648 is an example of=
 this. (Take a breath we=E2=80=99re done with the dates.) That treaty estab=
lished the modern state system and helped to (very slowly) establish peace =
in Europe. The 650 year period between those dates is a tremendous example =
of longterm contextual awareness driving territorial ambition, as we see st=
ory after story of longterm planning, revenge, and territorial ambition dri=
ving wars across Europe. That=E2=80=99s exactly the kind of dominance seeki=
ng behavior AI is supposed to exhibit to doom us all. The problem is not ju=
st that AI doesn=E2=80=99t have longterm context to enable this kind of vio=
lent behavior, it=E2=80=99s that we don=E2=80=99t know how to even solve th=
e memory problems needed to give AI this capability.=20
Objection: They=E2=80=99re working on AI memory now. ChatGPT has memory now=
=2E It=E2=80=99s just going to get better.=
 We see AI longterm task intent dou=
bling every few months. Nate, you=E2=80=99re just unreasonably anchored on =
the present!=20
No. We are not making real progress on any kind of longterm context. Gettin=
g a model to burn very high token counts is 1) extremely expensive, and 2) =
is still tied to the same set of narrow policy guardrails that enabled the =
agentic task in the first place. When Claude Code goes for hours (as it doe=
s occasionally), it=E2=80=99s not going extra long because it has more memo=
ry. It=E2=80=99s been given a task and it solves it. Time is relevant to us=
, not to Claude Code.=20
And ChatGPT memory is a set of a few text boxes you can edit in the UI. The=
 difference between that and true longterm context is not an incremental st=
ep. Not even an incremental leap. It=E2=80=99s the Grand Canyon. It=E2=80=
=99s not something that=E2=80=99s going to be magically solved partly becau=
se the memory problem is a physical atoms problem=E2=80=94where do we get t=
he chips, what does memory encoding at scale look like. Are people working =
on this? Yes, notably OpenAI. Are they showing the kind of progress p(doom)=
 would require? Not remotely. The model amnesia isn=E2=80=99t going to stop=
 anytime soon.
Proactive general agentic intent: AI is not developing useful proactive int=
ent. It is in fact extremely difficult to develop useful proactive intent f=
or specific tasks, let along useful proactive general agentic intent. Agent=
s today are agents you tell tasks to, and they (hopefully) do them. Agents =
that drive their own destiny may be entertaining, but they are not general =
purpose (e.g. the infamous example of goatseus maximus [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/7792e857-448f-419f-b147-f26e9dab78a4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] is an example of a running chat=
bot with a rolling chat window, amnesia, and no general capabilities). With=
out proactive general agentic intent, it is nearly impossible to develop mi=
litary strategy, and p(doom) absolutely requires military strategic intent =
from AI to work.
Objection: Nate, you=E2=80=99re reasoning from the present again. We now ha=
ve AI that can go and use tools to make powerpoints. That was impossible tw=
o weeks ago. Stop assuming general intent is so hard to develop.=20
No. For one thing, let=E2=80=99s not mistake technical capacity for a meani=
ngful step change in competence (see my writeup [ https://open.substack.com=
/pub/natesnewsletter/p/openai-chatgpt-agent-mode-review?r=3D1z4sm5&utm_camp=
aign=3Dpost&utm_medium=3Dweb&showWelcomeOnShare=3Dtrue ]). But more importa=
ntly, the ability to use tools is not the same as the ability to develop pr=
oactive general agentic intent. The definition of an agent is an LLM + tool=
s + guidance. It needs the direction. And experiments like Truth Terminal [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/69455be6-86c3-4864-aa73-ba2a94a30efc?j=3DeyJ=
1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] show exactly=
 what happens when LLMs don=E2=80=99t have that guidance. The AI spirals, d=
evelops extremely clever memes, but at no point displays useful intent.=20
These gaps are chained, so this is an excellent time to point you back to #=
2 Longterm Context if you are worried about deception and faking intent. TL=
DR; deception is only militarily valuable when an agent has skin in the gam=
e, longterm general agentic intent, and a sense of longterm context. Playin=
g games of Diplomacy [ https://substack.com/redirect/4889c3b7-baba-4a9a-85c=
b-af41ed32f3ee?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ] when instructed to do so isn=E2=80=99t the same thing.
So there are important discontinuities between present state and the trajec=
tory we need to be on to get to a p(doom) scenario. And critically, nobody =
really knows how to solve them, partly because they require novel solutions=
 that are outside the core transformer architectures that enabled LLMs in t=
he first place.=20
The best bet proponents of Superintelligence have in the nearterm is likely=
 the ability of an LLM to learn on the go after training. Proponents of doo=
m would argue that is enough to get you all three of the above. Proponents =
of superintelligence would agree and argue that is enough to get you a supe=
rintelligent entity, which they say is good.=20
I think I would argue neither is true. Just being able to learn as you go d=
oesn=E2=80=99t inherently solve problems that don=E2=80=99t depend on more =
learning (including all three of the above, including longterm context=E2=
=80=94learning doesn=E2=80=99t solve memory, it makes it worse).
Quick sidebar: If you go for the economic doom version of doomsday and this=
 military stuff isn=E2=80=99t doing it for you, let me just point out that =
the three discontinuities I called out above also need to be solved to enab=
le an AI to deliver the kind of doomsday people like to worry about. At pre=
sent there=E2=80=99s no evidence in macro economic data whatsoever that AI =
is impacting employment. And I=E2=80=99m not the only one saying that. Disr=
uption will happen, but right now the disruption of AI looks a lot like oth=
er economic technological changes, not something new.
Anyway, this letter has nearly gone on long enough. There=E2=80=99s one oth=
er thing I want to talk about. The idea of bet sizing.=20
In poker and stock markets, the entire game is sizing your bets correctly g=
iven a particular hand or market opportunity. Do it wrong, and you go bankr=
upt. Do it right and you buy the private jet or get kicked out of Vegas, wh=
ichever you prefer.=20
The arguments about whether we are doomed are implicit arguments about bet =
sizing for AI, and I want to stop hiding that claim in the weeds and bring =
it into the sunshine where we can look at it properly.
Because if we do, I think many of us would ask ourselves if the bet was siz=
ed right.
Here=E2=80=99s the p(doom) bet: There is (x) non-zero risk of humanity goin=
g extinct due to a hostile AI. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter what (x) is, if it=
 is non-zero it is too high and it should take all (or an arbitrarily large=
 number) of our resources to at least gives ourselves the chance to fix it.=
 (There are flavors here=E2=80=94not everyone wants to fix it, but that=E2=
=80=99s another conversation.)=20
(This is exactly the same argument that pushed Elon to develop Starship=E2=
=80=94except his focus was on asteroid resilience.)
The problem with bet sizing is this: p(doom) is an inherently unverifiable =
claim. We=E2=80=99re being asked to agree with the correctness of the claim=
 because it is not provably zero, and therefore divert a huge resource shar=
e off of provably extant risks with measurable occurrences in order to prev=
ent this supposedly existential risk.
There is no such thing as a free lunch, and there is no such thing as a fre=
e risk. Apparently in Ukraine the equivalent saying is =E2=80=9Cthere is no=
 free cheese except in the mouse trap=E2=80=9D which is much more metal. Th=
e point is that as a society we have to place our bets. And right now we ar=
e under-betting on other provable AI risks.=20
Let me list a few I think we should invest at least 10x more heavily in add=
ressing:
AI fraud risk education and prevention for seniors
AI education, particularly around critical thinking, for students
AI usage norms, a common code of etiquette around AI usage
AI deepfakes and identity protection
I can hear you saying that these risks are not really tradeoffs, and it=E2=
=80=99s not fair to p(doom) advocates to pretend they are. I strongly disag=
ree. Airtime and attention are very scarce.=20
We are spending a tremendous amount of public attention scaring people abou=
t catastrophic risks they cannot control, poisoning public attitudes toward=
 AI in the process, and saying very little about the materializing AI risks=
 we can control. There is only so much attention to go around.=20
I would sleep better at night if we took those risks more seriously. But th=
ese are not the risks that most people worry about with AI. These are not t=
he doomsday risks.=20
Look, I'm not saying AI isn't disruptive or that we won't face new challeng=
es. I work in this field=E2=80=94I see how powerful these systems are becom=
ing. But I also see their limitations up close.
What helps me sleep at night is looking at the actual trajectory of AI deve=
lopment versus the theoretical scenarios that require everything to change =
all at once. What helps me is seeing how we've consistently managed to adap=
t to disruptive technologies throughout history.
Most importantly, what helps me is focusing on the problems we can actually=
 solve today instead of getting paralyzed by theoretical problems we might =
face tomorrow.
My kids are going to grow up in a world with AI, but I believe it's going t=
o be a world where we've figured out how to make AI helpful while managing =
its risks=E2=80=94just like we've done with every other powerful technology=
=2E
The future is going to be different, but it doesn't have to be dark. And ri=
ght now, based on everything I can see, we're not on a path to the apocalyp=
se. We're on a path to something more like every other technological revolu=
tion: messy, disruptive, but ultimately manageable if we focus on the real =
challenges instead of the imaginary ones.
Let's talk about the risks we face today. Let's work on fixing those. That'=
s a much more productive use of our time than worrying about scenarios that=
, frankly, we're not on track to hit.

;font-size: 16px;">I can hear you saying that these risks are not really tr=
adeoffs, and it=E2=80=99s not fair to p(doom) advocates to pretend they are=
. I strongly disagree. Airtime and attention are very scarce. </p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

ning public attitudes toward AI in the process, and saying very little abou=
t the materializing AI risks we can control. There is only so much attentio=

height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Look, I'm not saying AI isn't disruptive or =
that we won't face new challenges. I work in this field=E2=80=94I see how p=
owerful these systems are becoming. But I also see their limitations up clo=
se.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">What helps me sleep at night is looking at the actual t=
rajectory of AI development versus the theoretical scenarios that require e=
verything to change all at once. What helps me is seeing how we've consiste=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=

n actually solve today instead of getting paralyzed by theoretical problems=
 we might face tomorrow.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">My kids are going to grow up in a =
world with AI, but I believe it's going to be a world where we've figured o=
ut how to make AI helpful while managing its risks=E2=80=94just like we've =
done with every other powerful technology.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The future is go=
ing to be different, but it doesn't have to be dark. And right now, based o=
n everything I can see, we're not on a path to the apocalypse. We're on a p=
ath to something more like every other technological revolution: messy, dis=
ruptive, but ultimately manageable if we focus on the real challenges inste=
ad of the imaginary ones.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=

ur time than worrying about scenarios that, frankly, we're not on track to =
hit.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=
