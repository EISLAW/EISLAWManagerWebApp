I=E2=80=99ve been waiting twenty years to write this article.
Not because I needed the right moment or the perfect story. Because I neede=
d the tools to actually work.
I=E2=80=99ve watched wave after wave of =E2=80=9Cdemocratize software creat=
ion=E2=80=9D promises crash against reality. Visual programming languages t=
hat were too rigid. No-code tools that hit walls the moment you needed anyt=
hing custom. Low-code platforms that required developers anyway. AI coding =
assistants that helped engineers write code faster but did nothing for ever=
yone else.
Each time, I=E2=80=99d get excited. Each time, I=E2=80=99d test them. Each =
time, I=E2=80=99d find the gap between promise and reality too wide to cros=
s. And each time, I=E2=80=99d think about all the people I know=E2=80=94phy=
sical therapists seeing clinic chaos, consultants drowning in intake emails=
, employees watching teams waste hours on spreadsheets=E2=80=94who have the=
 expertise to solve their problems but not the coding skills to build the s=
olutions.
Not anymore! I figured out across a couple of dozen builds what really work=
s, and I=E2=80=99m putting it all together for you here:
A demo video showing three different builds I made
Four separate build tracks with detailed prompts and tips
Personal app builds
Side-gig builds
Backoffice app builds for work
Consultant builds
My personal lessons learned building in Lovable (and other companies)
Full prompts to get you started
Remixable apps from each of my demos (plus a BONUS app because why not)
A breakdown of Lovable=E2=80=99s preferred prompt framework and why it work=
s
This window won=E2=80=99t last. But right now, today, you can build things =
that seemed impossible last month. And most folks haven=E2=80=99t figured i=
t out yet. Two hours to a working prototype. Four hours to validate a busin=
ess idea. Two days to give your team a tool that saves twenty hours weekly.
This article explains exactly what Lovable enables, what each build track c=
an realistically accomplish, and where the real value lives. No hype. No ma=
rketing. Just honest guidance on what actually works, from someone who=E2=
=80=99s spent two decades waiting for tools that deliver on their promises.
And this week matters: On September 29, Lovable launched two things simulta=
neously: Lovable Cloud (which eliminates the backend headaches that=E2=80=
=99s killed no-code tools for decades) and a partnership with Google that m=
akes their enterprise AI FREE through October 6. Together, these two launch=
es mean it=E2=80=99s the easiest time to start building in 20 years. What a=
 great week to be a builder!
PS. Don=E2=80=99t think you can build? I dare you. I dare you to give it a =
shot. This is the easiest it has ever been, especially with tools like Sonn=
et 4.5 [ https://substack.com/redirect/183d3d2a-df5c-4f82-be4e-c9aa21c1db09=

 week is the time.=20

Lovable Just Made Building Software Prototypes Absurdly Simple (And Why Tha=
t Matters)
TL;DR
Lovable is a Swedish AI platform that hit $100M revenue in eight months by =
letting non-technical people build working prototypes through conversation.=
 You describe what you want, it generates functional code with basic backen=
d, you deploy to a test URL. No coding required.
They launched new features September 29 that add Google=E2=80=99s AI and bu=
ilt-in infrastructure. Free through October 6, but the platform works with =
regular pricing too ($20-40/month, or export to GitHub and host yourself).
This article has four realistic build tracks with honest capabilities:=20
Personal Apps (learning tool)
Side Gigs (idea validation)
Internal Tools (spreadsheet replacements)
Consultant Projects (methodology demos).=20
Each includes what works versus marketing hype, and each gives you prompts =
to start building in less than 5 minutes (you can see how in the video as w=
ell).
Reality check: Lovable builds prototypes and MVPs, not production enterpris=
e software. You can validate ideas quickly and build useful personal/team t=
ools, but complex integrations, multi-tenant systems, and enterprise featur=
es require traditional development.
Time to working prototype: two hours. Cost after free period: $20-40/month,=
 or zero if you self-host.
Quick Path Assessment: Choose Your Build Track

P.S. Want to start extra fast? Steal my builds=E2=80=A6
These are great app starters for larger projects=E2=80=94you can remix them=
, add more backend detail, integrate transactions, and be off to the races!=
=20
Think of them as half-baked bread=E2=80=94they have strong prompts and dire=
ction to get you going and you just have to supply the polish you need for =
your use-case (or pivot them toward your own business goals).

Introduction: What Lovable Does
I=E2=80=99ve spent twenty years watching developer tools make ambitious pro=
mises about democratizing software creation. Most fail. Some work at the ma=
rgins. Almost none change who can build what.
Lovable is genuinely useful, but not for the reasons their marketing sugges=
ts.
On September 29, 2025, the Swedish AI startup launched Lovable AI and Lovab=
le Cloud. These features eliminate some technical barriers and create reali=
stic tools for specific use cases=E2=80=94not production enterprise softwar=
e.
Lovable lets you build working prototypes in hours instead of months. You c=
an validate business ideas, create personal tools, replace team spreadsheet=
s, and demonstrate consulting frameworks. You cannot build scalable multi-u=
ser platforms, complex enterprise systems, or production-ready applications=
 without significant additional work.
The numbers are real. Lovable launched November 2024 and hit $100M ARR by J=
uly 2025. They did this with 2.3 million users and 180,000 paying subscribe=
rs. That growth proves genuine demand for rapid prototyping tools.
I built a meeting notes analyzer this morning in under two hours. It works =
for my personal use. It demonstrates the concept. It would need substantial=
 work to become a product others could use reliably. That=E2=80=99s the rea=
listic assessment.
This article explains what Lovable enables, what each build track can reali=
stically accomplish, and where the real value lives. Not hype. Not marketin=
g. Just honest guidance on what works.
The Company Behind the Platform
Lovable exists because Anton Osika got frustrated.
In June 2023, while serving as CTO at Depict.ai (a YC-backed e-commerce ML =
company), Osika built a side project called gpt-engineer. It was an open-so=
urce tool that demonstrated how large language models could write functiona=
l code from simple prompts. The project exploded. It became one of the fast=
est-growing GitHub repositories, accumulating more than 50,000 stars and hu=
ndreds of thousands of users.
The traction revealed something: massive latent demand for tools that let n=
on-technical people build software. Osika saw a larger opportunity. AI shou=
ldn=E2=80=99t just help engineers code faster=E2=80=94it should help everyo=
ne else build. The problem wasn=E2=80=99t that people lacked good ideas. Th=
e problem was that 99% of good ideas die because the people who understand =
problems don=E2=80=99t know how to code solutions.
He partnered with Fabian Hedin, an engineer whose previous work included de=
veloping the interface for Stephen Hawking=E2=80=99s computer and working w=
ith ex-SpaceX engineers on wheelchair technology. Together, they founded Lo=
vable and launched a commercial version of gpt-engineer in December 2023. I=
t saw modest success. Growth quickly flatlined.
They rebuilt everything. The new version, which became =E2=80=9CLovable=E2=
=80=9D in November 2024, took a different approach. Instead of targeting de=
velopers who wanted AI assistance, they built for non-technical users who w=
anted to create production-grade software. The launch strategy was straight=
forward: Product Hunt (#1 product of the day), social media updates about i=
mprovements, and online competitions with prizes for builders.
What made it work wasn=E2=80=99t the strategy=E2=80=94those tactics are sta=
ndard. What made it work was that the AI was genuinely good enough to deliv=
er on the promise. People could build functional applications. And when som=
ething works that well, people talk about it.
The growth trajectory that followed defies normal patterns. Lovable reached=
 $10 million ARR in 60 days. $17 million ARR in 90 days with 30,000 paying =
customers, built on just $2 million in total spend. By February 2025, they =
were building 25,000 new products daily. By March, they had 45,000 paid cus=
tomers and were adding $2.5 million ARR weekly. By May, they hit $50 millio=
n ARR. By July, $100 million ARR with retention rates above 85%.
In July 2025, Accel led a $200 million Series A at a $1.8 billion valuation=
=E2=80=94the largest Series A ever raised by a Swedish software company. Th=
e round included participation from existing investors and a remarkable ros=
ter of angel investors: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Remote CEO Job =
van der Voort, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield, HubSpot co-founder Dha=
rmesh Shah.
Enterprise customers followed consumer adoption. Klarna, HubSpot, and Photo=
room are using Lovable. A large Brazilian edtech company built an app on Lo=
vable that grossed $3 million in 48 hours. In June 2025, users built over 2=
=2E5 million websites with Lovable=E2=80=
=94more than 10% of all new websites=20=
on the internet that month.
This context matters because the September 29 launch isn=E2=80=99t an isola=
ted product update. It=E2=80=99s the next step in an already-extraordinary =
trajectory.
What Changed on September 29
Lovable introduced two capabilities that make prototyping faster.
Lovable AI (powered by Google=E2=80=99s Gemini) adds AI features to applica=
tions without requiring API knowledge. You describe what analysis you want,=
 it implements basic AI functionality. This works for prototypes and person=
al tools. It doesn=E2=80=99t handle production-scale AI features, error han=
dling for edge cases, or enterprise reliability requirements.
Lovable Cloud provides basic backend infrastructure. User authentication wo=
rks. Simple databases work. File uploads work for basic use cases. This eli=
minates common setup friction for prototypes.
What these features enable: rapid prototype development (hours instead of w=
eeks), personal tool creation without technical knowledge, team tools that =
replace spreadsheets, concept validation before investing in real developme=
nt.
What these features don=E2=80=99t enable: production-ready enterprise appli=
cations, complex multi-tenant systems, HIPAA/SOC2 compliant applications, s=
calable infrastructure for thousands of users, complex integrations with ex=
ternal systems.
The combination is genuinely useful for its use case: fast prototyping and =
concept validation.
How to Build: The CLEAR Prompting Method
The difference between failed prompts and working prototypes is structure. =
Lovable responds best to what they call the CLEAR framework: Concise, Logic=
al, Explicit, Adaptive, Reflective. Lovable calls out CLEAR explicitly in t=
heir documentation as best practice.
The most reliable format is =E2=80=9CTraining Wheels=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94a str=
uctured approach that works even for complex applications:
Context: [Set up the scenario and your role]
Task: [Define exactly what you=E2=80=99re building]
Guidelines: [Specify tech stack, approach, design principles]
Constraints: [Hard limits, requirements, boundaries]

Bad Prompt: =E2=80=9CBuild me a food truck app with routes and weather=E2=
=80=9D
Realistic Good Prompt:
Context: You are building a route planning tool for food truck operators wh=
o want to track their daily stops and sales.

Task: Create a personal route tracker where operators can log their planned=
 stops, record sales at each location, and see which locations perform best=
 over time.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with mobile-first design
- Lovable Cloud for data storage
- Simple data entry forms
- Basic analytics showing best locations

Constraints:
- Single-user application (one food truck operator)
- Manual data entry (no API integrations)
- Basic charts for visualization
- Mobile-optimized for in-truck use

Start with: Form to log today=E2=80=99s stops and sales, then add historica=
l view.

Notice what this realistic prompt includes: single-user focus (not multi-te=
nant), manual data entry (no complex APIs), basic functionality (no automat=
ed everything), clear starting point (one feature first).
The Home Cooking Revolution
We=E2=80=99ve been missing the equivalent of home cooking in software. We n=
ow have it.
Think about the difference between cooking at home and going to a restauran=
t. If you want to go to the restaurant and order from a chef, that=E2=80=99=
s great. You don=E2=80=99t have to cook at that level at home. But we need =
home cooking. We need the ability to make ourselves dinner without hiring a=
 professional chef every time we=E2=80=99re hungry.
That=E2=80=99s what Lovable provides: home cooking for software. It won=E2=
=80=99t give you as much flexibility as working with professional engineers=
, but for most people, they don=E2=80=99t need that. They just need to solv=
e their specific problem.
In twenty years of building, it has never been this easy. I have probably m=
ore than 20 projects in Lovable at this point. All of them are interesting =
to me for different reasons. The sections below walk through how to use thi=
s capability to build things that matter.
But expectations need calibration. Building Salesforce on Lovable isn=E2=80=
=99t happening. No one=E2=80=99s doing that. There=E2=80=99s a difference b=
etween the complexity and data scale required for enterprise software and t=
he kinds of tools you can build for personal use, for small team use, in Lo=
vable.
None of that diminishes Lovable=E2=80=99s usefulness. I=E2=80=99d argue it=
=E2=80=99s more useful than a lot of classic enterprise software providers =
because it=E2=80=99s so flexible. You can build so many different things an=
d come back and do it again and again.

you have 10+ recipes saved.

What Success Looks Like
Success means you have a tool you use. Not a prototype sitting unused. Not =
something you show people but never open. A tool integrated into your daily=
 routine that makes your life measurably easier.
You=E2=80=99ve learned the development loop. You understand AI tools=E2=80=
=99 capabilities and limitations. You can build another tool tomorrow.
BUILD TRACK 2: Side Gig Apps Track
For: Weekend Builders Validating Business Ideas
Timeline: 4 hours to working prototype
What You=E2=80=99re Building: MVP to test market interest
Realistic Outcome: Proof of concept you can show potential customers
Not Building: Scalable SaaS ready for paid users
What Works for Revenue Validation
You can build simple specialized tools solving narrow problems, single-user=
 prototypes demonstrating value, basic calculators and planning tools, conc=
ept demos to validate customer interest.
You cannot build multi-tenant SaaS platforms, automated payment processing,=
 complex API integrations, production-scale applications.
Critical reality: These builds help you validate WHETHER people want your s=
olution before investing in proper development. They=E2=80=99re not the fin=
al product.
Realistic Build Examples

- No real-time SEO data (just AI keyword suggestions)
- Basic save/delete functionality only

Start with: Topic generation form and results display. Add save functionali=
ty after generation works well.

Revenue Validation Strategy:
Build this in 4 hours
Share in writer Facebook groups: =E2=80=9CI built this tool, would you pay =
$10/month?=E2=80=9D
Get 20 people to try it (free for feedback)
If 5+ say they=E2=80=99d pay, you=E2=80=99ve validated the concept
Then invest in building the real product with proper development
Realistic pricing: If you validated demand, you might charge $10-20/month. =
But this prototype can=E2=80=99t handle payment processing reliably. You=E2=
=80=99d need to rebuild with proper infrastructure.
Simple Invoice Tracker for Freelancers
What You Can Build:
Form to create invoices (client, amount, date, description)

- No automated payment processing
- No email automation
- Text-based (no company logo uploads initially)

Start with: Invoice creation form and list view. Add PDF generation and AI =
reminders after basic tracking works.

Revenue Validation: Share in freelancer communities. Ask =E2=80=9CWould you=
 pay $15/month for this?=E2=80=9D If yes from 10+ people, the concept is va=
lidated. But this prototype needs significant work before accepting payment=
s.
Niche Calculator (Example: Freelance Rate Calculator)

Form collecting business details (hours available, desired income, expenses=
)
AI analysis with recommended hourly/project rates
Comparison against industry benchmarks (manual data entry)

- Simple calculations only

Start with: Input form and basic calculation. Add AI insights and scenario =
saving after core math works.

Revenue Validation: This could be freemium: free calculator with limited fe=
atures, $10 one-time payment for detailed analysis and scenario saving. But=
 this version is for validation only.
The Realistic Revenue Path
Week 1-2: Build Prototype
Invest 4-6 hours building
Deploy working demo
Test yourself extensively
Week 3-4: Validation Testing
Share in 5 relevant communities
Ask: =E2=80=9CWould you pay $X/month for this?=E2=80=9D
Goal: 20 people try it, 5+ say they=E2=80=99d pay
Collect detailed feedback on missing features
Month 2-3: Decision Point
If validation succeeded (5+ would pay): You=E2=80=99ve proven the market ex=
ists. Now invest in proper development or find technical co-founder. This p=
rototype proved the concept but isn=E2=80=99t the final product.
If validation failed (<5 would pay): You learned in 4 hours instead of 4 mo=
nths. Pivot to different idea or different audience. Total investment: one =
weekend, not your life savings.
What Success Looks Like
Success is validating whether people want your solution before investing mo=
nths building it. You=E2=80=99re not building a business in Lovable. You=E2=
=80=99re testing if a business opportunity exists.
The prototype demonstrates value. Real users test it. Multiple people say t=
hey=E2=80=99d pay. Now you know it=E2=80=99s worth building properly.
BUILD TRACK 3: Internal Apps Track
For: Employees Fixing Workplace Inefficiencies
Timeline: 2 days to working team tool
What You=E2=80=99re Building: Better replacement for spreadsheets
Realistic Outcome: Tool your team uses daily, massive time savings
Not Building: Enterprise software with complex integrations
What Works at Work
You can build team productivity tools replacing spreadsheets, simple workfl=
ow tracking (manual data entry), basic reporting dashboards, meeting and pr=
oject organization, equipment or resource tracking.
You cannot build CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot), automated billing =
systems, HIPAA or SOC2 compliant applications, complex approval workflows, =
enterprise SSO integration.
The value: Most workplace inefficiency comes from spreadsheets, email chain=
s, and disconnected tools. A simple custom tool beats that easily.
Realistic Build Examples
Team Meeting Notes with Action Items
What You Can Build:
Form for logging meeting notes (date, attendees, discussion, decisions)
AI extraction of action items from notes
Dashboard showing all open action items by person
Simple completion tracking

- Manual note entry after meetings
- No calendar integration
- No automated notifications (check dashboard manually)
- Basic role management (everyone can view/edit)

Start with: Meeting note entry form and list view. Add AI action item extra=
ction after basic logging works.

Real impact: Your team wastes 5+ hours weekly chasing down =E2=80=9Cwhat wa=
s decided?=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwho was supposed to do that?=E2=80=9D This=
 tool eliminates that waste. It=E2=80=99s not fancy, but it=E2=80=99s massi=
vely valuable.
Simple Expense Submission Portal
What You Can Build:
Form for submitting expense requests (amount, category, description, receip=
t photo)
List of all submitted expenses with status
Manager view to review and approve/deny
Simple reporting dashboard (total spent by category)
Basic file upload for receipts
What You Can=E2=80=99t Build:
Automated reimbursement processing
Accounting system integration
Complex approval workflows (multi-level)
Automated policy compliance checking
Integration with corporate cards
Copy This Prompt:
Context: You are building an expense submission tool to replace our email-b=
ased expense process where requests get lost and take weeks.

Task: Create a simple expense portal where employees submit expenses and ma=
nagers can approve them in one place.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with form-focused design
- Lovable Cloud for data and file storage
- Form for expense submission (amount, category, date, description, receipt=
 upload)
- List views: employee sees their submissions, manager sees all pending

Constraints:
- Team of 10-50 people
- Manual approval process (no automated rules)
- No payment processing (just tracking)
- No accounting software integration
- Basic receipt file uploads only

Start with: Expense submission form and manager review interface. Add repor=
ting dashboard after core workflow works.

Real impact: Currently expenses get submitted via email, approvals take 2-3=
 weeks, receipts get lost. This tool gives everyone visibility and cuts app=
roval time to 1-2 days. Not sophisticated, but solves the real problem.
Equipment Checkout System
What You Can Build:
List of available equipment (laptops, cameras, tools, etc.)
Check-out form (who, what, when returning)
Dashboard showing what=E2=80=99s available vs. checked out
Simple return functionality
Basic history of past checkouts
What You Can=E2=80=99t Build:
RFID or barcode scanning
Automated overdue reminders
Integration with HR systems
Complex reservation calendars
Maintenance scheduling
Copy This Prompt:
Context: You are building an equipment checkout system to replace our share=
d spreadsheet where people forget to update it and equipment goes missing.

Task: Create a simple checkout tracker where team members can see available=
 equipment and log checkouts.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with inventory-style interface
- Lovable Cloud for data storage
- List of all equipment with status (available/checked out)
- Check-out form (equipment, person, expected return date)

- Simple check-in button when equipment returns
- History log of all checkouts

Constraints:
- Small team (5-30 people)
- Manual check-out/check-in (honor system)
- No automated reminders
- Basic equipment tracking only (no maintenance logs)
- No integration with other systems

Start with: Equipment list and check-out form. Add history and availability=
 dashboard after basic tracking works.

Real impact: The spreadsheet is chaos. People forget to update it. You don=
=E2=80=99t know where equipment is. This tool is the single source of truth=
 everyone uses because it=E2=80=99s simpler than the spreadsheet.
Internal Tool Strategy
Week 1: Build - Spend 2 days building, deploy internally, train 3-5 team me=
mbers.
Week 2-4: Prove Value - Track time saved (be specific: =E2=80=9Csaved 5 hou=
rs this week=E2=80=9D), document errors prevented, gather team feedback.
Month 2: Expand - Roll out to full team, add requested features, calculate =
total impact.
Month 3: Career Value
Option A - Performance Review: =E2=80=9CI built tool that saves team 20 hou=
rs weekly,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CEliminated X errors per month,=E2=80=9D justif=
y raise based on value created.
Option B - Other Departments: Finance hears about your tool, wants similar =
for their process. Build for them, establish yourself as problem-solver, po=
sition for operations or tech role.
Option C - External Value: Tool works so well, other companies in your indu=
stry would want it. Requires significant additional work to make it a produ=
ct, but you have proof of concept and first customer (your company).
What Success Looks Like
Your team uses it daily. Old method (spreadsheets/email) completely abandon=
ed. Measurable time savings and error reduction. You=E2=80=99re seen as som=
eone who solves problems, not just identifies them.
The tool isn=E2=80=99t perfect. It has limitations. But it=E2=80=99s dramat=
ically better than what it replaced, and that=E2=80=99s what matters.
BUILD TRACK 4: Consultant Track
For: Consultants Demonstrating Methodology
Timeline: 1 week to working demo
What You=E2=80=99re Building: Interactive demonstration of your framework
Realistic Outcome: Tool that showcases your expertise and streamlines intak=
e
Not Building: Automated multi-client platform
What Works for Client Value
You can build assessment tools demonstrating your methodology, simple analy=
sis dashboards showcasing expertise, client intake and scoping tools, indus=
try-specific calculators, benchmarking tools with manual data.
You cannot build multi-tenant platforms with client workspaces, white-label=
ing for client brands, automated report generation from templates, enterpri=
se integrations, scalable client portal systems.
The value: These tools demonstrate you have a real methodology, not just ge=
neric advice. They streamline your intake process and impress prospects.
Realistic Build Examples
Marketing Maturity Assessment
What You Can Build:
Questionnaire assessing client=E2=80=99s marketing across key dimensions
Scoring system based on your framework
AI-generated recommendations based on scores
Simple comparison to industry benchmarks (manual data)
PDF summary client can download
What You Can=E2=80=99t Build:
Automated competitive analysis
Multi-client dashboard with all assessments
White-labeled versions for each client
Integration with marketing platforms
Automated report delivery
Copy This Prompt:
Context: You are building a marketing maturity assessment tool to demonstra=
te your consulting framework and streamline client qualification.

Task: Create an interactive assessment where prospects answer questions abo=
ut their marketing, receive maturity scoring, and get initial recommendatio=
ns.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with professional B2B design
- Lovable Cloud for storing assessment results
- Multi-step form covering: strategy, content, channels, measurement, team
- Scoring system based on answers (your framework)
- Lovable AI for generating personalized recommendations

- Static benchmark data (not live API)
- Basic PDF export (not branded templates)
- One assessment per session

Start with: Question form and scoring display. Add AI recommendations after=
 scoring works. Add PDF export last.

How You Use This:
Sales Process: Prospect asks about your services. =E2=80=9CLet me send you =
our free assessment tool.=E2=80=9D They complete assessment, see their scor=
es. Tool generates recommendations based on YOUR framework. You follow up: =
=E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s discuss implementing these recommendations.=E2=80=9D
Value: You=E2=80=99re not doing the full consulting engagement for free. Yo=
u=E2=80=99re demonstrating you have a real framework and can provide specif=
ic value. Assessment results become the basis for your proposal.
Reality check: This won=E2=80=99t replace your consulting. One client can=
=E2=80=99t log in and access it separately from another. You=E2=80=99d run =
the assessment with each prospect individually. It=E2=80=99s a sales tool, =
not a product.
Client Intake Questionnaire with Insights
What You Can Build:
Comprehensive intake form specific to your niche
AI analysis of responses identifying key challenges
Automatic scoping suggestions based on responses
Simple priority ranking of initiatives
Summary you can reference in proposals
What You Can=E2=80=99t Build:
Client portal with login access

nstraints, timeline
- Lovable AI to analyze responses and identify patterns
- AI-generated scoping recommendations
- Priority ranking of identified initiatives
- Simple export of all information for your use

Constraints:
- One intake per form submission
- No client portal (you send link, they fill once)
- Basic form functionality (no collaboration)
- Your use only (not client-facing dashboard)
- Manual follow-up based on insights

Start with: Intake form with all necessary questions. Add AI analysis after=
 form submission works.

How You Use This:
Consulting Process: New client inquiry comes in. Send them intake form link=
=2E They complete comprehensive questio=
nnaire (30 min vs. week of emails). AI=
 analyzes responses, surfaces key insights. You review AI analysis, prepare=
 targeted proposal. First meeting is strategic discussion, not information =
gathering.
Value: Saves 5-10 hours of back-and-forth emails. You arrive at first meeti=
ng fully prepared. Client is impressed by thoroughness. But it=E2=80=99s no=
t a magic automation=E2=80=94you still do the consulting work.
Industry Benchmarking Calculator
What You Can Build:
Form collecting client metrics (revenue, team size, KPIs)
Comparison against industry data (manually entered by you)
AI analysis of gaps and opportunities
Simple recommendations for improvement
Visualization of where they stand vs. benchmarks
What You Can=E2=80=99t Build:
Real-time industry data APIs
Automated competitive intelligence
Multi-client database for comparison
White-labeled versions
Automated report generation
Copy This Prompt:
Context: You are building a benchmarking tool to show prospects where they =
stand against industry standards in your area of expertise.

Task: Create a calculator where clients input their metrics and receive ben=
chmark comparison with improvement recommendations.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with data-visualization focus
- Lovable Cloud for storing calculations
- Form collecting key metrics relevant to your niche
- Comparison against industry benchmarks (data you provide)
- Lovable AI for gap analysis and recommendations
- Visual charts showing position vs. benchmarks
- Simple save/export functionality

Constraints:
- Static benchmark data (you maintain it manually)
- One calculation per session
- No automated data sources
- Basic charts only (not interactive dashboards)
- Your expertise encoded in recommendations

Start with: Metrics input form and benchmark comparison display. Add AI rec=
ommendations after comparison works.

How You Use This:
Expertise Demonstration: Speaking at conference or webinar. =E2=80=9CTry ou=
r free benchmark calculator=E2=80=9D as call-to-action. Prospects complete =
it, see where they lag. Your AI provides specific recommendations (based on=
 your methodology). Follow-up conversations are qualified and targeted.
Value: Demonstrates you have data and expertise, not just opinions. Generat=
es leads who self-identify gaps. Positions you as the solution. But it requ=
ires you to maintain benchmark data and provide the consulting.
Consultant Platform Reality Check
What These Tools Do: Demonstrate you have a real methodology, streamline te=
dious parts of your process, impress prospects with professionalism, qualif=
y leads more efficiently, provide talking points for sales conversations.
What These Tools Don=E2=80=99t Do: Replace your consulting, run independent=
ly without you, handle multiple clients simultaneously in separate workspac=
es, generate income without your involvement, scale your business 10x autom=
atically.
The Realistic Value Proposition
Before: You spend 10 hours on intake/qualification for every prospect. Half=
 aren=E2=80=99t good fits. You discover this after investing significant ti=
me.
After: Prospects complete your assessment/intake tool (30 minutes). AI anal=
yzes responses. You review in 30 minutes and decide if they=E2=80=99re a fi=
t. Good fits arrive at first meeting thoroughly prepared.
Time Saved: 5-8 hours per prospect. Better qualification. More professional=
 first impression.
Revenue Impact: Not from selling the tool. From winning more consulting eng=
agements because you appear more sophisticated and your process is more eff=
icient.
What Success Looks Like
Prospects complete your tool and are impressed by the thoroughness. You sav=
e 5+ hours per prospect on qualification and intake. Your close rate improv=
es because better-qualified prospects reach proposal stage.
The tool showcases your expertise and streamlines your process. It doesn=E2=
=80=99t replace you or run autonomously. That=E2=80=99s the honest value pr=
oposition.
Three Builder Principles That Matter
These are from hard-won experience as a builder. I have them just about wri=
tten in blood over the desk.
1. Stick to Your Niche
You know your users, you know your customers, you are one of your customers=
, you know the problem space. Whatever it is that you know=E2=80=94maybe it=
=E2=80=99s not food trucks, maybe it=E2=80=99s not Legos, maybe it=E2=80=99=
s something else=E2=80=94stick with the niche you know, because you=E2=80=
=99re going to be able to build much more useful products.
This applies to consultants as well. Look at the domain experience you alre=
ady have.
2. Action Beats Waiting
Don=E2=80=99t be afraid to launch something that isn=E2=80=99t perfect. Pro=
duct market fit is surprisingly coarse grained. It is not perfect. It is ju=
st good enough. If you have product market fit, you=E2=80=99ll know because=
 people will clamor to sign up for your product no matter what.
Even if it=E2=80=99s not fully perfect, even if there are issues with it, e=
ven if your funnel isn=E2=80=99t all the way baked out. Too many people who=
 are new to building hesitate, wait, want to plan, say, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99=
ll start when lovable has integrated payments. It=E2=80=99s not ready yet. =
Lovable hasn=E2=80=99t done payments.=E2=80=9D
Action beats waiting. Action beats planning. Action beats everything else b=
ecause it enables you to go faster, to iterate, to build as you go.
3. Think in Bets
You now have the possibility to think in bets the way an entrepreneur does.=
 Even if you don=E2=80=99t think of yourself as a full-time entrepreneur, i=
t=E2=80=99s still a good career resilience habit to think in bets.
You can say, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know what=E2=80=99s going to work. I=
=E2=80=99m going to put five or six different lovable prototypes out there =
that are related to my passion, my domain interest, and see how it goes.=E2=
=80=9D
This isn=E2=80=99t hard. You can go into Perplexity or Claude or ChatGPT, a=
nd say, =E2=80=9CFollowing clear prompt principles, I want to build this th=
ing that=E2=80=99s a small business.=E2=80=9D You describe what it is. =E2=
=80=9CPlease prepare a prompt for lovable using best practice for lovable=
=E2=80=99s documentation.=E2=80=9D
And off you go.
Revenue Models That Work
For Personal Apps: No Revenue
These are personal productivity tools. You built them for yourself. The val=
ue is in solving your problem and learning to build. Don=E2=80=99t try to m=
onetize personal tools.
For Side Gigs: Validation, Not Revenue
Your Lovable prototype validates the business concept. It doesn=E2=80=99t g=
enerate reliable revenue.
The Realistic Path: Build prototype in 4 hours. Share with 20-50 potential =
customers. Goal: 5-10 people say =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d pay for this.=E2=80=
=9D Decision point=E2=80=94if validated, invest in proper development or fi=
nd technical co-founder. If not validated, pivot or abandon in 4 hours inst=
ead of 4 months.
Don=E2=80=99t try to charge for the Lovable prototype. It=E2=80=99s not rel=
iable enough. Do use it to validate before investing real money in developm=
ent.
For Internal Apps: Career Capital
Internal tools generate value through time savings (track hours saved per w=
eek), error reduction (document mistakes prevented), performance reviews (=
=E2=80=9DBuilt tool saving 20 hours weekly=E2=80=9D), career advancement (p=
osition for operations or tech roles), internal consulting (build tools for=
 other departments).
Typical Pattern: Month 1-2, build tool, prove value to your team. Month 3-4=
, expand to other teams or departments. Month 6, performance review with do=
cumented impact. Result: $5k-15k raise or promotion, or foundation for inte=
rnal tech/operations role.
For Consultants: Sales Tool Value
Consultant tools generate value through better qualification (waste less ti=
me on bad-fit prospects), professional impression (stand out from generic c=
onsultants), efficient intake (replace 10 hours of emails with 30-minute fo=
rm), higher close rates (better-prepared prospects convert more), premium p=
ositioning (sophisticated process justifies higher fees).
Typical Impact: 5-8 hours saved per prospect. 10-20% improvement in close r=
ate. Ability to handle 50% more prospects. Net result: $20k-50k additional =
annual revenue from efficiency.
Why This Combination Is Genuinely Useful
Most no-code tools promise too much and deliver too little. Lovable is genu=
inely useful for its capabilities.
What Lovable enables: rapid prototyping (hours instead of weeks), personal =
tool creation without coding, team tool development replacing spreadsheets,=
 business idea validation before major investment, consultant methodology d=
emonstration.
Why this matters: Most projects die because prototyping takes too long. Mos=
t team inefficiencies come from bad spreadsheets, not missing enterprise so=
ftware. Most business ideas should be validated before spending $50k on dev=
elopment. Most consultants waste hours on intake that could be streamlined.
What Lovable doesn=E2=80=99t enable: production enterprise software develop=
ment, scalable multi-tenant SaaS platforms, complex system integrations, re=
placing professional development teams.
The value is real, but it=E2=80=99s specific. Lovable helps you validate id=
eas quickly, build personal/team tools efficiently, and demonstrate concept=
s professionally. It doesn=E2=80=99t replace traditional software developme=
nt for production applications.
The Real Opportunity (And Honest Constraints)
Who This Helps
You=E2=80=99re a physical therapist who sees scheduling chaos at work. You =
can build a better scheduling tool for your clinic=E2=80=99s 3 therapists. =
You can=E2=80=99t build HIPAA-compliant practice management software for 50=
,000 clinics.
You=E2=80=99re a consultant who spends 10 hours on intake emails. You can b=
uild an intake questionnaire that cuts that to 30 minutes. You can=E2=80=99=
t build an automated multi-client platform.
You=E2=80=99re a freelancer who loses track of invoices. You can build a pe=
rsonal invoice tracker. You can=E2=80=99t build a competitor to FreshBooks.
You=E2=80=99re an employee who watches colleagues waste time on spreadsheet=
s. You can build a better team tool. You can=E2=80=99t build enterprise sof=
tware with SSO and audit logs.
The Pattern That Works
Successful Lovable projects solve problems you personally experience, repla=
ce manual processes or spreadsheets, serve small groups (yourself, your tea=
m, your clients), have simple data models, use manual data entry, prototype=
 business concepts for validation.
Unsuccessful Lovable projects try to build production SaaS, require complex=
 integrations, need enterprise features, scale to thousands of users, requi=
re compliance certifications, attempt to replace established software.
The Honest Value Proposition
Lovable lets you test ideas fast (validate in hours instead of months), bui=
ld personal tools (solve your own problems), replace spreadsheets (give tea=
ms better tools), demonstrate expertise (show you have real methodology), l=
earn to build (understand what development involves).
Lovable doesn=E2=80=99t let you ship production software without additional=
 work, skip proper development for real products, build complex enterprise =
features, scale to thousands of concurrent users, or replace technical expe=
rtise entirely.
And somewhere in between those two extremes you can build a real business o=
n lovable and scale it to $1M ARR (yes it really has happened). If you have=
 a dream, Lovable is a great way to get software to help you build it.
What You Should Do
If You=E2=80=99re Reading During Free Period (Sep 29-Oct 6)
Build something small that solves a real problem you have. Not an ambitious=
 business idea. A simple tool you=E2=80=99ll use daily. Prove to yourself y=
ou can build functional software.
Export to GitHub before October 6. Preserve your work.
If You=E2=80=99re Reading After Free Period
The same guidance applies. Regular pricing is $20-40/month, which is reason=
able for a prototyping tool. Focus on validation and personal use, not prod=
uction applications.
Regardless of Timing
Start with problems you deeply understand. Don=E2=80=99t build for imaginar=
y users. Build for yourself, your team, or prospects you talk to regularly.
Be honest about what you=E2=80=99re building. It=E2=80=99s a prototype or p=
ersonal tool, not production software. That=E2=80=99s fine. Prototypes and =
personal tools have real value.
Validate before investing heavily. If you want to build a business, use Lov=
able to validate the concept. If people would pay for it, then invest in pr=
oper development.
Understand the tool=E2=80=99s limitations. Lovable is genuinely useful for =
rapid prototyping. It=E2=80=99s not a replacement for professional developm=
ent. Both can be true simultaneously.
Now is the time. One, now is the time because it=E2=80=99s always better th=
an tomorrow from a startup perspective. But two, now is specifically the ti=
me because the tools for creating software leverage are ahead of the people=
=2E If you want to be one of those peop=
le who knows how to use software to cr=
eate leverage for yourself, whether that=E2=80=99s a side gig or tools for =
work, now is the moment.
The technical revolution in software creation is real, but it=E2=80=99s spe=
cific. More people can build prototypes and personal tools. That=E2=80=99s =
meaningful. It doesn=E2=80=99t mean everyone can build everything. Understa=
nding this distinction lets you capture the real value while avoiding waste=
d effort on inappropriate use cases.

rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=
=E2=80=99ve spent twenty years watching developer tools make ambitious prom=
ises about democratizing software creation. Most fail. Some work at the mar=
gins. Almost none change who can build what.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=
x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Lovable is gen=
uinely useful, but not for the reasons their marketing suggests.</p><p styl=

6px;">On September 29, 2025, the Swedish AI startup launched Lovable AI and=
 Lovable Cloud. These features eliminate some technical barriers and create=
 realistic tools for specific use cases=E2=80=94not production enterprise s=
oftware.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Lovable lets you build working prototypes in hours=
 instead of months. You can validate business ideas, create personal tools,=
 replace team spreadsheets, and demonstrate consulting frameworks. You cann=
ot build scalable multi-user platforms, complex enterprise systems, or prod=
uction-ready applications without significant additional work.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">The numbers are real. Lovable launched November 2024 and hit $100M ARR=
 by July 2025. They did this with 2.3 million users and 180,000 paying subs=
cribers. That growth proves genuine demand for rapid prototyping tools.</p>=

vable exists because Anton Osika got frustrated.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">In June 20=
23, while serving as CTO at Depict.ai (a YC-backed e-commerce ML company), =
Osika built a side project called gpt-engineer. It was an open-source tool =
that demonstrated how large language models could write functional code fro=
m simple prompts. The project exploded. It became one of the fastest-growin=
g GitHub repositories, accumulating more than 50,000 stars and hundreds of =
thousands of users.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The traction revealed something: massiv=
e latent demand for tools that let non-technical people build software. Osi=
ka saw a larger opportunity. AI shouldn=E2=80=99t just help engineers code =
faster=E2=80=94it should help everyone else build. The problem wasn=E2=80=
=99t that people lacked good ideas. The problem was that 99% of good ideas =
die because the people who understand problems don=E2=80=99t know how to co=
de solutions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">He partnered with Fabian Hedin, an engineer w=
hose previous work included developing the interface for Stephen Hawking=E2=
=80=99s computer and working with ex-SpaceX engineers on wheelchair technol=
ogy. Together, they founded Lovable and launched a commercial version of gp=
t-engineer in December 2023. It saw modest success. Growth quickly flatline=
d.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">They rebuilt everything. The new version, which became =
=E2=80=9CLovable=E2=80=9D in November 2024, took a different approach. Inst=
ead of targeting developers who wanted AI assistance, they built for non-te=
chnical users who wanted to create production-grade software. The launch st=
rategy was straightforward: Product Hunt (#1 product of the day), social me=
dia updates about improvements, and online competitions with prizes for bui=
lders.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">What made it work wasn=E2=80=99t the strategy=E2=80=
=94those tactics are standard. What made it work was that the AI was genuin=
ely good enough to deliver on the promise. People could build functional ap=
plications. And when something works that well, people talk about it.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">The growth trajectory that followed defies normal patterns. Lova=
ble reached $10 million ARR in 60 days. $17 million ARR in 90 days with 30,=
000 paying customers, built on just $2 million in total spend. By February =
2025, they were building 25,000 new products daily. By March, they had 45,0=
00 paid customers and were adding $2.5 million ARR weekly. By May, they hit=
 $50 million ARR. By July, $100 million ARR with retention rates above 85%.=

 a remarkable roster of angel investors: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski=

consumer adoption. Klarna, HubSpot, and Photoroom are using Lovable. A larg=

in 48 hours. In June 2025, users built over 2.5 million websites with Lovab=

 have it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think about the difference between cooking at hom=
e and going to a restaurant. If you want to go to the restaurant and order =
from a chef, that=E2=80=99s great. You don=E2=80=99t have to cook at that l=
evel at home. But we need home cooking. We need the ability to make ourselv=
es dinner without hiring a professional chef every time we=E2=80=99re hungr=
y.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=

oftware. It won=E2=80=99t give you as much flexibility as working with prof=
essional engineers, but for most people, they don=E2=80=99t need that. They=
 just need to solve their specific problem.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=

 of building, it has never been this easy. I have probably more than 20 pro=
jects in Lovable at this point. All of them are interesting to me for diffe=

 build things that matter.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

 spending and identifying patterns.

Task: Create a simple expense logging app where I can record purchases and =
see spending patterns over time.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with mobile-first design
- Lovable Cloud for data storage
- Form for adding expenses (amount, category, date, note)
- List view with filtering by category and date
- Lovable AI for analyzing spending patterns weekly
- Basic charts showing category breakdown

Constraints:
- Single user (just me)
- Manual entry for each expense
- Five preset categories (food, transport, shopping, bills, other)
- Mobile-optimized for daily use

Start with: Expense entry form and list view. Add AI analysis once basic lo=
gging works.

Task: Create a centralized meeting notes system where team members can log =
meetings, and AI extracts action items automatically.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with clean, professional design
- Lovable Cloud for data storage and team access
- Form for entering meeting notes (date, attendees, notes)
- Lovable AI for extracting action items from meeting notes
- Dashboard showing all open action items by assignee
- Search and filter functionality for past meetings
- Simple mark-as-complete for action items

Constraints:
- Team of 5-15 people (not hundreds)
- Manual note entry after meetings
- No calendar integration
- No automated notifications (check dashboard manually)
- Basic role management (everyone can view/edit)

Start with: Meeting note entry form and list view. Add AI action item extra=
ction after basic logging works.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with form-focused design

- Manual approval process (no automated rules)
- No payment processing (just tracking)
- No accounting software integration
- Basic receipt file uploads only

Start with: Expense submission form and manager review interface. Add repor=
ting dashboard after core workflow works.

Context: You are building a marketing maturity assessment tool to demonstra=
te your consulting framework and streamline client qualification.

Task: Create an interactive assessment where prospects answer questions abo=
ut their marketing, receive maturity scoring, and get initial recommendatio=
ns.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with professional B2B design
- Lovable Cloud for storing assessment results
- Multi-step form covering: strategy, content, channels, measurement, team
- Scoring system based on answers (your framework)
- Lovable AI for generating personalized recommendations
- Simple benchmark comparison (manually entered industry data)
- PDF generation of results

Constraints:
- Single user per assessment (not multi-tenant)
- Manual scoring logic (no complex algorithms)
- Static benchmark data (not live API)
- Basic PDF export (not branded templates)
- One assessment per session

Start with: Question form and scoring display. Add AI recommendations after=
 scoring works. Add PDF export last.

g a benchmarking tool to show prospects where they stand against industry s=
tandards in your area of expertise.

Task: Create a calculator where clients input their metrics and receive ben=
chmark comparison with improvement recommendations.

Guidelines:
- React/TypeScript with data-visualization focus
- Lovable Cloud for storing calculations
- Form collecting key metrics relevant to your niche
- Comparison against industry benchmarks (data you provide)
- Lovable AI for gap analysis and recommendations
- Visual charts showing position vs. benchmarks
- Simple save/export functionality

Constraints:
- Static benchmark data (you maintain it manually)
- One calculation per session
- No automated data sources
- Basic charts only (not interactive dashboards)
- Your expertise encoded in recommendations

Start with: Metrics input form and benchmark comparison display. Add AI rec=
ommendations after comparison works.

 its capabilities.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">What Lovable enables: rapid prototyping =
(hours instead of weeks), personal tool creation without coding, team tool =

nvestment, consultant methodology demonstration.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Why this m=
atters: Most projects die because prototyping takes too long. Most team ine=
fficiencies come from bad spreadsheets, not missing enterprise software. Mo=
st business ideas should be validated before spending $50k on development. =
Most consultants waste hours on intake that could be streamlined.</p><p sty=

 real, but it=E2=80=99s specific. Lovable helps you validate ideas quickly,=
 build personal/team tools efficiently, and demonstrate concepts profession=
ally. It doesn=E2=80=99t replace traditional software development for produ=
