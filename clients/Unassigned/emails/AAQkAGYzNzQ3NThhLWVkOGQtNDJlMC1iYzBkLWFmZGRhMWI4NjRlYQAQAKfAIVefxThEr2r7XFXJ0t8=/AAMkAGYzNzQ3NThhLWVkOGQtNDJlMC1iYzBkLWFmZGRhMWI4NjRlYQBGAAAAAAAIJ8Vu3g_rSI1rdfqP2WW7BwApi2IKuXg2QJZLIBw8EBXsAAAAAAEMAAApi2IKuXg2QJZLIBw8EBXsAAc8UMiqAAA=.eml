May 27=2C 2025

Comment/Correction needed: The article states that Lithuania does not shar=
e a border with Russia. This is not correct. Lithuania shares a border wit=
h Kaliningrad.

Response: A very bad mistake=2C with a barely credible explanation. There=
 is an about 140-mile border. I always disregarded this as a Russian acces=
s point because the massing of forces on the border would take a long time=
=2C giving ample time for massing of NATO forces and massive airstrikes. F=
or me=2C the border was not vulnerable=2C and any attack on the Baltic sta=
tes would not be credible. Of course=2C if they massed in Belarus as well=
 they=E2=80=99d be even more obvious. So I obviously allowed my prior anal=
ysis to cancel out the border. I told you this was a lousy explanation=2C=
 but it=E2=80=99s all I=E2=80=99ve got. My very bad. Sorry.
Comment/Question: Please address Germany and Europe=E2=80=99s need (or lac=
k thereof) for Russian oil. Include your thoughts on whether this need for=
 Russian oil has been reduced in the last couple of years.


Response: The Germans drew about a third of their oil from Russia before t=
he war. They have reduced that dependency substantially. The loss of Russi=
an oil would be a manageable problem at this point=2C even if painful to s=
ome extent.
Comment/Question: Please address why Europe was unable to federalize so th=
at there would be economic and political integration. Note=2C the reader d=
oes not view the EU as a federation.

Response: Federation means that the federal government governs. In the Uni=
ted States it took the Civil War to establish that the states were not sov=
ereign=2C but subordinate to the Federal government. In Europe language=2C=
 culture and history make each nation radically different from others. The=
 creation of a sovereign government there is hard to imagine. It took a lo=
ng time to get over the Civil War. A federal government consisting of hist=
orical enemies=2C and the nations trusting them to govern them would be ha=
rd in Europe. These nations could not be subsumed under one government I t=
hink.
Comment/Question: Please explain why Germany=E2=80=99s deployment of troop=
s to Lithuania is a new development for NATO. Take into consideration the=
 fact that the US has stationed troops in Poland and British/French troops=
 have been stationed in Baltic countries.

Response: First=2C because this is a German deployment. NATO was created n=
ot only to block Russia but also to prevent Germany from becoming a sovere=
ign military power. So when Germany bases troops in Lithuania=2C and says=
 they are permanent=2C it may not be as dramatic and dangerous an event as=
 it would have been in 1950=2C but it still generates memories. The fact t=
hat this was a German deployment and not a NATO deployment using German tr=
oops makes it a new development in European history=2C and in some minds=
=2C a return to a bad history.
Question/Clarification: In the last paragraph you write: =E2=80=9CThe shoc=
k to Europe has generated the kind of response it wanted.=E2=80=9D A coupl=
e of readers asked for clarification on what =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=9D refers t=
o.

Response: The United States has wanted to reduce its responsibility for Eu=
ropean security=2C and thereby reduce its exposure. It wished that Europe=
 would take responsibility for its own security and risks by building and=
 deploying its own military=2C and limiting U.S. responsibility. When NATO=
 was created=2C only the U.S. was in a position to block Soviet power. Tha=
t is no longer the case and the U.S. hopes that by shocking Europe with th=
reats to reduce U.S. responsibility for European security=2C they would sh=
oulder the responsibility themselves. So the German decision to move a bri=
gade to Lithuania was what the United States wanted to see.
Question on Russia-Ukraine War: Please explain why there can=E2=80=99t be=
 a treaty that includes Russia that says any signatory attacking another s=
ignatory will be attacked by the rest of the countries included in the tre=
aty. (Somewhat in line with the spirit of NATO=E2=80=99s Article 5 but app=
lied only to treaty members and not outside aggressors.)

Response: Russia had signed an agreement with Hitler=E2=80=99s Germany tha=
t guaranteed that neither would attack the other. Hitler double-crossed Ru=
ssia. Two things flow out of this. The Russians distrust all treaties guar=
anteeing each other=E2=80=99s security. For the rest of Europe and the Uni=
ted States=2C Russia=E2=80=99s agreement with Hitler=E2=80=99s Germany was=
 a betrayal in the extreme. Treaties are simply promises and nations=2C li=
ke humans=2C frequently break their word. So treaties between countries th=
at have the same interest make sense; otherwise=2C they mean little. Natio=
nal interest trumps national integrity.
Question on Russia-Ukraine War: Assume Russia manages to conquer a substan=
tial part of Ukraine. Please share your thoughts on the different possible=
 reactions in Eastern Europe. Consider the possibility of the populations=
 of Eastern Europe voting for parties that support peace with Russia.

Response: Eastern Europe will have a faction wanting to align with Russian=
 power=2C so that Russia has no reason to invade them. There will be anoth=
er faction saying that accommodation will turn them into Russian satellite=
s. Since most of them were satellites and their memories aren=E2=80=99t pl=
easant=2C there is a faction that wants to resist Russia. The key variable=
 will be in whether Europe or the United States will protect them since th=
ey think themselves too weak to protect themselves. In the long term the q=
uestion is whether Russian power is real or an illusion. Right now=2C Russ=
ia doesn=E2=80=99t look that good.

There is another dimension to this=2C which is ideological. Russia no long=
er has any ideology but nationalism and authoritarianism. There is a histo=
rical dimension in that most of Eastern Europe was like that before World=
 War II=2C and some want to return to that=2C while others want to be libe=
ral democracies=2C and are internationalists and liberals (not in the U.S.=
 sense of the term). So Eastern Europe as a whole is facing an identity cr=
isis.
Question on Africa: Please share your thoughts on the U.S. decision to cut=
 funding for aid programs=2C particularly in terms of the impact on Africa=
=2E Keep in mind that in =E2=80=9CThe Next Decade=E2=80=9D you stated that t=
he multitude of languages was the most significant impediment to getting a=
id to the populations in Africa.

Response: Foreign aid was a uniquely American concept. It was developed du=
ring the Cold War as a way to draw countries from Europe and the Third Wor=
ld away from the Soviets and communism=2C taking advantage of U.S. economi=
c power=2C which was the Soviet Union=E2=80=99s weak point. Now that the C=
old War is over=2C it is no longer a necessary tool. There was a dimension=
 of charity built into foreign aid=2C but it was more ruthless than that=
=2C while appearing only to be charitable. Sometimes=2C geopolitical inter=
ests generate decent actions. Mostly not.
Vietnam War Commentary: Please share your thoughts on the global=2C geopol=
itical results of the Vietnam War=2C including but not limited to US invol=
vement. Make sure to address China=2C Russia=2C Indochina and Indonesia/ma=
ritime Southeast Asia (along with any other players you consider relevant)=
=2E

Response: In the end the American defeat in Vietnam had few geopolitical c=
onsequences to the U.S. Stopping communism was the motive but the geopolit=
ical imperative was unclear. Ironically=2C a few years after the war ended=
=2C China invaded Vietnam and=2C to American pleasure=2C the Chinese were=
 defeated.

From my point of view the Vietnam War was fought with an arrogant belief t=
he U.S. couldn=E2=80=99t fail=2C and a moral imperative to stop communism.=
 Geopolitical reality was lacking=2C and the absence of ruthless geopoliti=
cal thinking on imperatives and capabilities defeated the U.S. We thought=
 the war was a guerrilla war=2C and we had to win the hearts and minds of=
 the peasants. It was a conventional war against a conventional army fough=
t on shifting fronts. The United States discovered that defeat did not mat=
ter. It would have been a comedy had it not been a tragedy of far greater=
 proportions.

<strong>Comment/Correction needed:</strong><em> </em><em>The article states=
 that Lithuania does not share a border with Russia. This is not correct. L=
ithuania shares a border with Kaliningrad.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>A very bad mistake, with a barely credible expla=
nation. There is an about 140-mile border. I always disregarded this as a R=
ussian access point because the massing of forces on the border would take =
a long time, giving ample time for massing of NATO forces and massive airst=
rikes. For me, the border was not vulnerable, and any attack on the Baltic =
states would not be credible. Of course, if they massed in Belarus as well =
they=E2=80=99d be even more obvious. So I obviously allowed my prior analys=
is to cancel out the border. I told you this was a lousy explanation, but i=
t=E2=80=99s all I=E2=80=99ve got. My very bad. Sorry.</p>

&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The Germans drew about a third of their oil from=
 Russia before the war. They have reduced that dependency substantially. Th=
e loss of Russian oil would be a manageable problem at this point, even if =
painful to some extent.

ase address why Europe was unable to federalize so that there would be econ=
omic and political integration. Note, the reader does not view the EU as a =
federation.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Federation means that the federal government gov=
erns. In the United States it took the Civil War to establish that the stat=
es were not sovereign, but subordinate to the Federal government. In Europe=
 language, culture and history make each nation radically different from ot=
hers. The creation of a sovereign government there is hard to imagine. It t=
ook a long time to get over the Civil War. A federal government consisting =
of historical enemies, and the nations trusting them to govern them would b=
e hard in Europe. These nations could not be subsumed under one government =
I think.</div>

altic countries.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>First, because this is a German deployment. NATO=
 was created not only to block Russia but also to prevent Germany from beco=
ming a sovereign military power. So when Germany bases troops in Lithuania,=
 and says they are permanent, it may not be as dramatic and dangerous an ev=
ent as it would have been in 1950, but it still generates memories. The fac=
t that this was a German deployment and not a NATO deployment using German =
troops makes it a new development in European history, and in some minds, a=
 return to a bad history.</div>

<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>The United States has wanted to reduce its =
responsibility for European security, and thereby reduce its exposure. It w=
ished that Europe would take responsibility for its own security and risks =
by building and deploying its own military, and limiting U.S. responsibilit=
y. When NATO was created, only the U.S. was in a position to block Soviet p=
ower. That is no longer the case and the U.S. hopes that by shocking Europe=
 with threats to reduce U.S. responsibility for European security, they wou=
ld shoulder the responsibility themselves. So the German decision to move a=
 brigade to Lithuania was what the United States wanted to see.</div>

s and not outside aggressors.) </em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Russia had signed an agreement with Hitler=E2=80=
=99s Germany that guaranteed that neither would attack the other. Hitler do=
uble-crossed Russia. Two things flow out of this. The Russians distrust all=
 treaties guaranteeing each other=E2=80=99s security. For the rest of Europ=
e and the United States, Russia=E2=80=99s agreement with Hitler=E2=80=99s G=
ermany was a betrayal in the extreme. Treaties are simply promises and nati=
ons, like humans, frequently break their word. So treaties between countrie=
s that have the same interest make sense; otherwise, they mean little. Nati=
onal interest trumps national integrity.</div>

trong> <em>Assume Russia manages to conquer a substantial part of Ukraine. =
Please share your thoughts on the different possible reactions in Eastern E=
urope. Consider the possibility of the populations of Eastern Europe voting=
 for parties that support peace with Russia</em>.<em> </em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Eastern Europe will have a faction wanting to al=
ign with Russian power, so that Russia has no reason to invade them. There =
will be another faction saying that accommodation will turn them into Russi=
an satellites. Since most of them were satellites and their memories aren=
=E2=80=99t pleasant, there is a faction that wants to resist Russia. The ke=
y variable will be in whether Europe or the United States will protect them=
 since they think themselves too weak to protect themselves. In the long te=
rm the question is whether Russian power is real or an illusion. Right now,=
 Russia doesn=E2=80=99t look that good.<br>
<br>
There is another dimension to this, which is ideological. Russia no longer =
has any ideology but nationalism and authoritarianism. There is a historica=
l dimension in that most of Eastern Europe was like that before World War I=
I, and some want to return to that, while others want to be liberal democra=
cies, and are internationalists and liberals (not in the U.S. sense of the =
term). So Eastern Europe as a whole is facing an identity crisis.</div>

                            <div><strong>Question on Africa:</strong> <em>P=
lease share your thoughts on the U.S. decision to cut funding for aid progr=
ams, particularly in terms of the impact on Africa. Keep in mind that in =
=E2=80=9CThe Next Decade=E2=80=9D you stated that the multitude of language=
s was the most significant impediment to getting aid to the populations in =
Africa.&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Foreign aid was a uniquely American concept. It =
was developed during the Cold War as a way to draw countries from Europe an=
d the Third World away from the Soviets and communism, taking advantage of =
U.S. economic power, which was the Soviet Union=E2=80=99s weak point. Now t=
hat the Cold War is over, it is no longer a necessary tool. There was a dim=
ension of charity built into foreign aid, but it was more ruthless than tha=
t, while appearing only to be charitable. Sometimes, geopolitical interests=
 generate decent actions. Mostly not.</div>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>In the end the American defeat in Vietnam had fe=
w geopolitical consequences to the U.S. Stopping communism was the motive b=
ut the geopolitical imperative was unclear. Ironically, a few years after t=
he war ended, China invaded Vietnam and, to American pleasure, the Chinese =
were defeated.<br>
<br>
From my point of view the Vietnam War was fought with an arrogant belief th=
e U.S. couldn=E2=80=99t fail, and a moral imperative to stop communism. Geo=
political reality was lacking, and the absence of ruthless geopolitical thi=
nking on imperatives and capabilities defeated the U.S. We thought the war =
was a guerrilla war, and we had to win the hearts and minds of the peasants=
. It was a conventional war against a conventional army fought on shifting =
fronts. The United States discovered that defeat did not matter. It would h=
ave been a comedy had it not been a tragedy of far greater proportions.</di=
