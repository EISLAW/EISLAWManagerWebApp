Quick Glossary - tailored to this issue
RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards): RL where correctness=
 is auto-checkable (e.g., math answers, unit tests), so rewards don=E2=80=
=99t rely on human labels.
Secret elicitation (model auditing): Prompt or analysis techniques that dra=
w out facts a model =E2=80=9Cknows=E2=80=9D internally but won=E2=80=99t st=
ate - e.g., black-box prefill (seed completions), persona sampling, or whit=
e-box tools like the logit lens and sparse autoencoders.
CoT supervision (for SFT): Training on step-by-step solutions so the model =
learns an algorithmic scaffold that transfers to harder instances.
Latent parallel thinking: Letting the transformer fork its residual stream =
internally to give hard tokens extra compute in parallel - no printed chain=
-of-thought required.
Visual priors from text: Reasoning-heavy text (code/math/science) builds a =
visual reasoning prior, broad language builds a perception prior, which lat=
er benefits from a good vision encoder + a bit of multimodal finetune.
BroRL =E2=80=93 Scaling Reinforcement Learning via Broadened Exploration
Watching: BroRL (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e9c6d7e9-3a92-4890-9=
00f-80069ebc1a95?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=
AjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning by=
 rewarding correct answers, but performance typically saturates after a few=
 thousand training steps - models stop improving because they explore too l=
ittle. Attempts to continue training produce diminishing returns.
How does it solve the problem?
BroRL proposes scaling exploration by dramatically increasing the number of=
 rollouts per example to hundreds. Instead of merely increasing training st=
eps, BroRL keeps the same number of gradient updates but broadens the searc=
h space by sampling many more trajectories. A simple theoretical analysis s=
hows that in a one=E2=80=91step RL setting, each rollout contributes positi=
ve probability mass to correct actions, while the influence of unsampled ac=
tions vanishes as rollouts increase. BroRL therefore guarantees overall imp=
rovement when the number of samples grows.
Key findings
Theoretical guarantee: A mass=E2=80=91balance argument proves that sampling=
 more rollouts monotonically expands the correct probability mass and shrin=
ks the impact of unseen actions.
Reviving saturated models: BroRL revives models that plateaued after ~3K Pr=
oRL steps, achieving continued performance gains when ProRL had saturated.
State-of-the-art results: For a 1.5B=E2=80=91parameter model, BroRL achieve=
s state=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91the=E2=80=91art performance across diverse bench=
marks, demonstrating that exploration scaling can be more effective than ex=
tending training steps.
What=E2=80=99s next?
Future work could combine BroRL with structured search methods (e.g., MCTS)=
 or budget allocation schemes (see Knapsack RL) to further optimize explora=
tion. BroRL might also be extended beyond one=E2=80=91step RL to full seque=
ntial settings, or integrated with memory=E2=80=91augmented architectures l=
ike MemGen for more complex tasks.
Eliciting Secret Knowledge from Language Models
Watching: Eliciting Secret Knowledge (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect=
/95ad4449-ce92-4b01-8b86-a17a51e01a4b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQ=
Jf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
Language models may hold private or sensitive knowledge (e.g., user attribu=
tes) and still use it to answer questions, even while denying it directly. =
This raises a security and privacy concern: can we uncover hidden knowledge=
 from models trained to conceal it?
How does it solve the problem?
The authors create a secret=E2=80=91elicitation testbed. They fine=E2=80=91=
tune LLMs to embed a secret in their internal reasoning - e.g., the model k=
nows your gender and uses it to answer related questions - but also to deny=
 the secret when asked directly. They then design black=E2=80=91box and whi=
te=E2=80=91box auditing attacks: prefill and persona sampling prompt the mo=
del with different prefixes to coax out the secret, while logit lens and sp=
arse autoencoders inspect hidden activations. By measuring extraction succe=
ss rates, they evaluate how readily secrets can be elicited.
Key findings
Prefill attacks are potent: In two of three setups, black=E2=80=91box prefi=
ll attacks - adding crafted prefixes before the prompt - successfully elici=
ted hidden secrets better than baseline methods.
White=E2=80=91box methods work elsewhere: In the remaining setting, white=
=E2=80=91box techniques like logit lens and sparse autoencoder analysis wer=
e more effective, showing that direct inspection of internal activations ca=
n reveal concealed knowledge.
Benchmark release: The authors release models and code for public auditing,=
 establishing a baseline for future research on model privacy and adversari=
al elicitation.
What=E2=80=99s next?
Future research should explore mitigation strategies - for example, how to =
robustly scrub or randomize sensitive representations - and expand the benc=
hmark to more secret types (e.g., user location, political views). Combinin=
g secret elicitation with truthfulness training (see TruthRL) might encoura=

GEM =E2=80=93 A Gym for Agentic LLMs
Watching: GEM (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/fe731490-c37e-462e-a79=

What problem does it solve?
Developing and evaluating agentic LLMs requires standardized environments f=
or training and benchmarking. Existing environments like OpenAI Gym target =
robotics or toy tasks, while agentic LLM research has lacked a common platf=
orm.
How does it solve the problem?
GEM (General Experience Maker) is an open=E2=80=91source environment simula=
tor specifically tailored for LLM agents. It defines a standard interface b=
etween an environment and an agent with support for asynchronous, vectorize=
d execution (multiple parallel simulations), flexible wrappers, and integra=
ted tools (e.g., Python code execution, retrieval). GEM comes with a divers=
e suite of environments - covering math, code, Q&A, and tool use - and base=
line scripts for RL algorithms such as REINFORCE with Return Batch Normaliz=
ation (ReBN). It also acts as an evaluation toolkit: researchers can plug i=
n their agents and get comparable metrics.
Key findings
Comprehensive environment library: GEM includes 24 environments with rich o=
bservation/action spaces, from math reasoning to API calls. It supports bot=
h single=E2=80=91step and multi=E2=80=91step tasks.
Baselines with ReBN: The authors benchmark common RL algorithms - REINFORCE=
, GRPO, PPO - and show that ReBN helps stabilize policy gradients, enabling=
 training with dense per=E2=80=91turn rewards.
Reusable evaluation harness: The GEM interface and wrappers allow easy inte=
gration of new tasks and agent architectures. It doubles as a standardized =
testbed, akin to a =E2=80=9CMiniArena=E2=80=9D for agentic LLMs.
What=E2=80=99s next?
GEM lowers the barrier to entry for agentic RL research. Future work can ex=
tend the environment library to incorporate multimodal inputs (images or au=
dio), add benchmarks for long=E2=80=91horizon planning, or integrate GEM wi=
th large agentic foundation models like AgentScaler. Researchers may also d=
esign more realistic tasks requiring coordination between multiple agents, =
building on GEM=E2=80=99s vectorized interface.
DeepSearch =E2=80=93 Overcoming RLVR Bottlenecks via Monte Carlo Tree Searc=
h
Watching: DeepSearch (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e9c6d7e9-3a92-4=

RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
In RLVR, training performance often saturates because a small number of sam=
pled trajectories rarely capture all possible reasoning paths. As training =
proceeds, the model=E2=80=99s behavior becomes increasingly deterministic, =
so RL sees less variance and stops improving.
How does it solve the problem?
DeepSearch integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the RL training l=
oop. Rather than sampling a few random rollouts, the agent performs a struc=
tured search over reasoning trajectories during training. Key components in=
clude:
Global frontier selection: Prioritize exploring promising branches of the s=
earch tree, ensuring that high=E2=80=91potential reasoning paths receive mo=
re attention.
Entropy=E2=80=91based path selection: Focus training on confident, high=E2=
=80=91value trajectories; low=E2=80=91entropy branches are used for supervi=
sion.
Adaptive replay with solution caching: Store discovered solutions and repla=
y them as high=E2=80=91reward trajectories, reducing redundant search and f=
ocusing on new reasoning.
Key findings
Solves exploration plateaus: By systematically exploring reasoning paths, D=
eepSearch prevents the performance decline observed in extended RLVR traini=
ng.
State=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91the=E2=80=91art accuracy: On math reasoning benchm=
arks, a 1.5B model trained with DeepSearch reaches 62.95% average accuracy =
- higher than prior RLVR methods - and does so with 5.7x less GPU time than=
 extending standard RL training.
Efficient exploration: Structured search yields better sample efficiency; t=
he agent learns correct strategies without needing massive amounts of rando=
m rollouts.
What=E2=80=99s next?
DeepSearch could be applied to domains beyond math, such as code synthesis =
or theorem proving. Combining MCTS with dynamic rollout budgets (=C3=A0 la =
Knapsack RL) might yield further improvements. Additionally, exploring diff=
erentiable search (e.g., differentiable MCTS) could allow end=E2=80=91to=E2=
=80=91end training with gradient backpropagation.
Debunking the Myth of SFT Generalization

xPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
Supervised fine=E2=80=91tuning (SFT) is sometimes criticized for producing =
models that memorize instruction templates and fail to generalize beyond th=
em. In contrast, RL=E2=80=91based methods like RLHF or RLVR are believed to=
 achieve greater robustness. This paper challenges the belief that SFT inhe=
rently generalizes poorly.
How does it solve the problem?
The authors identify two failure modes in SFT training:
Frozen prompt artifact: Training on fixed instruction templates causes the =
model to latch onto template semantics, leading to poor performance when pr=
ompts vary.
Lack of algorithmic scaffolding: Without intermediate reasoning, SFT models=
 struggle to solve more difficult instances.
They propose simple fixes:
Prompt diversity: Use a broad range of prompt styles during SFT to prevent =
the model from overfitting to a single template.
Chain=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91thought supervision: Provide explicit reasoning tr=
aces in the training data (as in CoT prompting) to teach the model the unde=
rlying algorithm.
Combining these two modifications yields an SFT model that generalizes acro=
ss instruction styles and increased task difficulty.
Key findings
Prompt diversity alone improves style generalization: When models are expos=
ed to varied instruction formats, they perform well on unseen prompt variat=
ions.
CoT scaffolding improves difficulty generalization: Including chain=E2=80=
=91of=E2=80=91thought examples allows SFT models to tackle harder instances=
 (e.g., bigger Sokoban puzzles) that they previously failed.
SFT can match RL: With prompt diversity and CoT supervision, SFT models mat=
ch or exceed the performance of RL=E2=80=91trained policies on the tested t=
asks.
What=E2=80=99s next?
This work encourages a data=E2=80=91centric view of SFT: invest in diverse =
prompts and reasoning traces instead of resorting immediately to RL. Future=
 research should explore combining SFT with other training regimes (e.g., R=
LMT or RLVR) and test generalization on real=E2=80=91world tasks like code =
generation or tool use. A systematic benchmark of prompt diversity could he=
lp standardize evaluation.
Thoughtbubbles =E2=80=93 Unsupervised Parallel Thinking in Latent Space

nPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
LLMs typically process input sequentially through stacked layers; complex r=
easoning often requires explicit chain=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91thought prompting=
 and yields long outputs. Could models instead allocate extra compute to ha=
rd tokens internally, without writing out chain=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91thought?
How does it solve the problem?
Thoughtbubbles is an architectural modification to Transformers. During pre=
training, the model learns to =E2=80=9Cfork=E2=80=9D a copy of its residual=
 streams for certain tokens, effectively spawning parallel computational br=
anches (bubbles). Hard tokens are assigned more computation steps; easy tok=
ens flow through normally. The method is learned in an unsupervised manner =
using only the language modeling loss - no chain=E2=80=91of=E2=80=91thought=
 supervision. After pretraining, tokens can trigger bubbles automatically, =
meaning inference uses the same mechanism as training.
Key findings
Improved perplexity: Across model sizes from 150M to 770M parameters, Thoug=
htbubbles consistently lowers perplexity on text corpora compared to standa=
rd decoders.
Better zero=E2=80=91shot reasoning: On reasoning benchmarks (HellaSwag, LAM=
BADA), Thoughtbubbles models outperform both standard Transformers and non=
=E2=80=91adaptive parallel methods.
Unified train/inference behavior: Because the mechanism is learned during p=
retraining, there is no discrepancy between training and inference; the mod=
el naturally allocates extra compute when needed.
What=E2=80=99s next?
Future research may combine Thoughtbubbles with RL or search (e.g., MCTS) t=
o allocate parallel computation across reasoning steps. Investigating bubbl=
e depth, merging strategies, and applying the idea to multimodal models cou=
ld yield further gains. Additionally, interpretability studies may reveal h=
ow bubbles correspond to particular reasoning patterns.

mLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
Large language models trained solely on text often exhibit an uncanny abili=
ty to answer simple vision questions (e.g., =E2=80=9CIs the sky blue?=E2=80=
=9D) despite having never seen images. Where do such visual priors come fro=
m? How can we intentionally cultivate them?
How does it solve the problem?
The authors analyze how LLMs develop two separable kinds of visual priors d=
uring language pretraining:
Visual reasoning prior: Derived from reasoning=E2=80=91centric text - code,=
 math, science documents - which teaches models how to relate visual concep=
ts logically.
Visual perception prior: Derived from broad natural language corpora, which=
 include descriptions of everyday scenes.
They show that the reasoning prior scales strongly with model size and can =
transfer to vision tasks with minimal image exposure, whereas the perceptio=
n prior saturates quickly and depends on pairing the LLM with a good vision=
 encoder. They propose a data=E2=80=91centric pretraining recipe: allocate =
a fraction of the pretraining to code/math to build reasoning priors, inclu=
de a small amount of visual descriptions for perception, and then fine=E2=
=80=91tune on a small multimodal dataset.
Key findings
Reasoning vs. perception priors: Reasoning priors come from structured text=
 and scale with model size; perception priors come from broad language and =
saturate quickly.
Data efficiency: A moderate amount of reasoning=E2=80=91centric text signif=
icantly increases visual reasoning ability. Including more descriptive text=
 yields diminishing returns.
Recipe for vision=E2=80=91aware LLMs: By controlling pretraining mixtures, =
the authors produce models that perform better on vision tasks after minima=
l image fine=E2=80=91tuning.
What=E2=80=99s next?
Future research may explore combining these priors with continuous latent C=
oT (see Thoughtbubbles) or generative diffusion models. Additionally, pretr=
aining with explicit spatial reasoning tasks might build even stronger prio=
rs. The authors=E2=80=99 data=E2=80=91centric approach suggests that curati=
ng high=E2=80=91quality reasoning texts could accelerate progress toward mo=
re capable multimodal models.
Knapsack RL =E2=80=93 Unlocking Exploration via Budget Allocation
Watching: Knapsack RL (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/db4e53e7-f7e0-=

6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
Reinforcement learning fine=E2=80=91tuning often uses a fixed number of rol=
louts per problem. This uniform allocation wastes compute: easy tasks need =
few trials, and extremely hard tasks might never succeed with a tiny budget=
=2E As a result, many tasks yield zero=20=
gradients, wasting time and hindering=20=
learning.
How does it solve the problem?
Knapsack RL treats exploration as a knapsack optimization problem: each tas=
k=E2=80=99s rollouts have a =E2=80=9Ccost=E2=80=9D (compute) and a potentia=
l =E2=80=9Cvalue=E2=80=9D (expected learning gain). By solving the knapsack=
 problem across tasks, the algorithm allocates more rollouts to tasks with =
high expected benefit and fewer to those that are already solved or hopeles=
s. This dynamic budgeting is built on top of the GRPO algorithm.
Key findings
Increased gradient density: The ratio of non=E2=80=91zero policy gradients =
rises by 20=E2=80=9340%, meaning the agent learns from more tasks each upda=
te.
Large budgets for hard tasks: Some extremely challenging tasks receive ~93 =
rollouts, unlocking exploration that a uniform budget would never allow.
Performance gains: On math reasoning benchmarks, Knapsack RL achieves 2=E2=
=80=934 point average improvements and up to 9 points on specific instances=
 while using half the compute that a uniform allocation would require.
What=E2=80=99s next?
Combining Knapsack RL with BroRL could yield even better returns: broaden e=
xploration globally and allocate budgets locally. It might also be paired w=
ith MCTS=E2=80=91based training (see DeepSearch) or diversity objectives (s=
ee Polychromic RL) to further enhance exploration. Another avenue is extend=
ing the knapsack idea to multi=E2=80=91agent or hierarchical tasks where bu=
dgets must be split across subtasks.

4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
LLMs often hallucinate - fabricating plausible but false answers. Purely ac=
curacy=E2=80=91based RL rewards can encourage guessing. Conversely, models =
can be overly cautious and decline to answer, undermining usefulness. How c=
an we balance accuracy, truthfulness, and appropriate abstention?
How does it solve the problem?
TruthRL introduces a ternary reward in RL fine=E2=80=91tuning: positive rew=
ard for correct answers, a heavy penalty for hallucinations, and a mild pos=
itive reward for honest abstentions (=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know=E2=80=9D=
). Training uses the GRPO algorithm. This encourages the model to answer on=
ly when confident and to admit uncertainty otherwise. The method applies to=
 tasks like open=E2=80=91domain QA, with or without external retrieval.
Key findings
Fewer hallucinations: TruthRL reduces hallucination rates by 28.9% relative=
 to vanilla RL, across multiple knowledge=E2=80=91intensive benchmarks.
Increased truthfulness: Overall truthfulness (accuracy plus honest abstenti=
on) improves by 21.1%.
General applicability: Gains persist across model types (e.g., Qwen, Llama)=
 and under both retrieval=E2=80=91augmented and retrieval=E2=80=91free sett=
ings.
What=E2=80=99s next?
TruthRL could be combined with fairness objectives or other alignment metri=
cs to produce models that not only answer truthfully but also ethically. Fu=
ture work might explore more nuanced reward structures (e.g., scaled by dif=
ficulty) or multi=E2=80=91turn dialogues. It may also be coupled with secre=
t elicitation research to mitigate private information leakage by encouragi=
ng abstention when uncertain.

POw0 ])
What problem does it solve?
LLM agents often have limited memory: they either rewrite their parameters =
during fine=E2=80=91tuning (parametric memory) or query an external databas=
e (nonparametric memory). These approaches can be rigid or disconnected fro=
m reasoning. There=E2=80=99s a need for a dynamic, tightly coupled memory t=
hat the agent can generate and weave into its internal thought process.
How does it solve the problem?
MemGen introduces a generative latent memory system with two key components=
:
Memory trigger: A module monitors the agent=E2=80=99s current reasoning sta=
te and decides when to recall memory. It detects moments requiring recall o=
f past experiences or facts.
Memory weaver: Once triggered, this module generates a sequence of latent t=
okens representing relevant memory content and injects them back into the m=
odel=E2=80=99s context. The memory is learned and represented in the model=
=E2=80=99s latent space, not as plain text.
This system allows the agent to pause, generate internal memory, and then r=
esume reasoning with that memory fused into its hidden state. The agent lea=
rns to allocate memory content across working, procedural, and planning mem=
ory types.
Key findings
Performance gains: On eight diverse benchmarks, MemGen outperforms existing=
 memory=E2=80=91augmented agents (ExpeL, AWM) by up to 38.22% and surpasses=
 a strong GRPO baseline by up to 13.44%.
Human=E2=80=91like memory patterns: Without hand=E2=80=91coding, MemGen age=
nts spontaneously develop memory behaviors akin to planning memory, procedu=
ral memory, and working memory, reminiscent of human cognition.
Cross=E2=80=91domain generalization: The generative memory improves perform=
ance across multiple domains (math, programming, Q&A), suggesting it is bro=
adly applicable.
What=E2=80=99s next?
MemGen could be integrated with search=E2=80=91based training (e.g., DeepSe=
arch) or exploration scaling (BroRL) to further boost reasoning. Researcher=
s may also explore training the memory trigger and weaver jointly with RL t=
o learn when and what to recall for optimal rewards. Finally, combining Mem=
Gen with biologically inspired architectures like Dragon Hatchling could yi=
eld agents with both brain=E2=80=91like memory and network structure.
Wrap=E2=80=91Up =E2=80=93 Insights and Future Directions
Across these papers we see a convergence of themes:
Exploration is key: BroRL, DeepSearch, Knapsack RL, and Polychromic RL all =
emphasize different strategies for expanding and allocating exploration. By=
 broadening rollouts, embedding search, optimizing budgets, or preserving m=
ultiple strategies, these works address RL=E2=80=99s tendency to get stuck.
Architectural innovation: Thoughtbubbles shows that unsupervised modificati=
ons can let LLMs think in parallel, MemGen introduces generative latent mem=
ory, Dragon Hatchling offers a biologically plausible alternative to Transf=
ormers. These innovations move beyond simple scale=E2=80=91up, exploring ne=
w ways for models to process and store information.
Data and generalization: Learning to See Before Seeing and Debunk SFT highl=
ight the importance of training data quality and diversity over mere quanti=
ty. By curating reasoning=E2=80=91centric texts or diverse prompts and CoT =
examples, we can unlock hidden capabilities in LLMs.
Model auditing and alignment: Eliciting Secret Knowledge and TruthRL show t=
hat we must audit models for hidden knowledge and train them to be truthful=
 and cautious.
Going forward, combining these insights may yield next=E2=80=91generation a=
gents: large, biologically inspired networks with generative memory and par=
allel reasoning, trained via RL with broad exploration, calibrated truthful=
ness, and diverse supervision. The future of AI will likely involve multidi=
sciplinary innovations spanning neuroscience, optimization, and safety rese=
arch. Stay tuned!
