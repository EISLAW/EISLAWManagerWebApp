Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
- System prompt: The initial instructions that tell an AI model how to beha=
ve throughout a conversation - like giving a new employee their job descrip=
tion
- Context engineering: The art of structuring information and instructions =
to get better AI outputs (evolved from "prompt engineering")
- Planning tools: Functions that help AI break down complex tasks into step=
s - sometimes just forcing it to think before acting
- Sub-agents: Specialized AI instances spawned to handle specific subtasks,=
 like hiring contractors for parts of a project
- No-op: A programming term for an operation that does nothing - like a "th=
ink about it" button that just makes you pause
1. AI-Q: Open-Source Blueprint to Chat with Enterprise Data
Watching: AI-Q (blog [ https://substack.com/redirect/dfa1062c-3d45-47bf-b9b=
5-40ae559c47e1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ])
NVIDIA=E2=80=99s AI-Q blueprint integrates multimodal data ingestion, retri=
eval-augmented generation, and agentic reasoning to deliver enterprise-grad=
e answers in a secure, high-speed pipeline. The architecture features compo=
nents like NeMo Retriever for accelerated data extraction and embedding, a =
vector database (cuVS) for at-scale knowledge storage, and a Llama-based =
=E2=80=9CNemotron=E2=80=9D reasoning module that iteratively plans, reflect=
s, and refines outputs.
What problem does it solve? Modern enterprises drown in data =E2=80=93 from=
 emails and PDFs to chat logs and databases =E2=80=93 much of which goes un=
used. Employees struggle to find answers buried in these silos, leading to =
lost productivity and untapped institutional knowledge. The challenge is to=
 securely leverage internal data (often proprietary or sensitive) with AI, =
so workers can =E2=80=9Cchat=E2=80=9D with their enterprise=E2=80=99s infor=
mation and get accurate, fast answers without exposing data to third-party =
services.
How does it solve the problem? NVIDIA=E2=80=99s AI-Q provides a fully open-=
source blueprint for building an Artificial General Agent (AGA) that connec=
ts to private enterprise data. It defines a developer-friendly workflow wit=
h three building blocks: (1) NeMo Retriever microservices for multimodal da=
ta extraction and embedding (text, PDFs, tables, images, etc.) at up to 15=
=C3=97 faster speeds via GPU acceleration; (2) a high-performance vector da=
tabase (NVIDIA cuVS) to index and store embeddings for retrieval; and (3) t=
he NeMo Agent toolkit, featuring a Llama-based reasoning model (=E2=80=9CLl=
ama Nemotron=E2=80=9D) that can dynamically toggle between fast responses a=
nd an =E2=80=9Cextended thinking=E2=80=9D mode. In extended mode, the agent=
 can invoke tools like web search (via Tavily) or code execution, iterative=
ly plan, reason, and refine its answers. The blueprint shows how an agent i=
ngests up-to-date enterprise data, uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG=
) to ground responses in facts, and employs chain-of-thought reasoning to p=
roduce coherent, detailed answers =E2=80=93 all integrated with enterprise =
authentication, security, and monitoring.
What are the key findings? AI-Q=E2=80=99s reference implementation =E2=80=
=93 an AI Research Assistant that digests hours of research papers in minut=
es =E2=80=93 demonstrates the blueprint=E2=80=99s effectiveness. Another ex=
ample, a Biomedical Research Agent, was built to rapidly synthesize medical=
 studies for pharma R&D. The system consistently delivers accurate, source-=
grounded answers across domains like IT, finance, and healthcare, thanks to=
 its combination of up-to-date retrieval and agent reasoning. Notably, NVID=
IA reports 5=C3=97 faster inference from their optimized Llama models (dubb=
ed =E2=80=9CNemotron=E2=80=9D) which can selectively dial down reasoning fo=
r simple queries or ramp up for complex ones. By maintaining a local =E2=80=
=9Cmemory file=E2=80=9D of important facts, the agent avoids forgetting con=
text over long sessions. Early adopters found that AI-Q drastically reduces=
 the time employees spend searching for information, while keeping data on-=
premises. The open blueprint has also sparked community contributions, exte=
nding it to new data sources and custom tools.
Why does it matter? AI-Q moves enterprises from passive data hoards to inte=
ractive knowledge bases. Crucially, it=E2=80=99s fully open-source =E2=80=
=93 lowering the barrier for companies to deploy their own ChatGPT-like ass=
istant without handing data to a third party. This empowers organizations t=
o harness LLMs for internal use cases (like answering employee IT questions=
, summarizing legal documents, or debugging code) with transparency and cus=
tomization. By demonstrating that a thoughtfully designed pipeline (multimo=
dal ingestion + RAG + agent reasoning) can achieve robust results with mode=
st resources, NVIDIA=E2=80=99s blueprint could accelerate adoption of AI be=
hind the firewall.
2. Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving
Watching: Seed-Prover (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/e29723d0-2945-=
42e9-8020-38f3fbbf2801?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Solving advanced mathematics =E2=80=93 especial=
ly writing full formal proofs for contest-level problems =E2=80=93 has rema=
ined a =E2=80=9Choly grail=E2=80=9D for AI. While large language models can=
 handle many textbook math questions, they struggle with Olympiad problems =
requiring creative, multi-step proofs and rigorous verification. The challe=
nge is twofold: searching the enormous proof space (many possible lemmas an=
d strategies) and ensuring the solution is correct (something traditional L=
LM outputs can=E2=80=99t guarantee). Prior systems could only prove a small=
 fraction of contest problems, often via brute-force search or heavy hand-h=
olding, highlighting the gap between superficial reasoning and the deep log=
ic needed for theorem proving.
How does it solve the problem? Seed-Prover (from ByteDance=E2=80=99s Seed A=
I4Math team) marries Large Language Model intuition with formal proof verif=
ication in a closed-loop. During training, it uses the Lean theorem prover =
as a sandbox: the model proposes proof steps which are immediately checked =
for correctness, giving a clear success/failure signal (unlike vague =E2=80=
=9Cright or wrong=E2=80=9D feedback in natural language). The model learns =
a lemma-focused strategy: instead of jumping straight to the final answer, =
it generates intermediate lemmas (sub-problems) and proves those, gradually=
 building up to the full solution. At inference (problem-solving) time, See=
d-Prover employs three complementary strategies to explore proofs both deep=
 (following a long chain of reasoning) and broad (trying alternative approa=
ches). One strategy, for instance, allows the model to refine or restart it=
s proof based on Lean=E2=80=99s feedback (if a line of reasoning fails, it =
backtracks and tries a different approach), while another strategy leverage=
s a specialized geometry solver (Seed-Geometry) for tackling challenging ge=
ometry problems. By iteratively generating, verifying, and adjusting proof =
steps, the system essentially performs a guided search through the space of=
 possible proofs =E2=80=93 harnessing the creativity of LLMs but anchored b=
y the strict rules of formal math.
What are the key findings? Seed-Prover achieved a breakthrough result in au=
tomated math: it successfully found formal proofs for 5 out of 6 problems f=
rom the IMO 2025 competition =E2=80=93 a feat unparalleled by previous AI s=
ystems. During the live contest, the system fully solved 4 problems within =
the allotted time (and solved the fifth shortly after). These included prob=
lems in geometry, number theory, combinatorics, and algebra =E2=80=93 domai=
ns that demand diverse techniques. Overall, Seed-Prover can now prove 78% o=
f past IMO problems when formalized, and it set new state-of-the-art scores=
 on benchmarks like MiniF2F and PutnamBench, dramatically outperforming pri=
or models. Qualitatively, the model=E2=80=99s proofs often mirrored human-l=
ike approaches, discovering key lemmas and insights (and in one case even f=
inding a novel solution variant for a problem). The use of Lean verificatio=
n meant that every step of the proof was checked =E2=80=93 significantly re=
ducing errors or =E2=80=9Challucinations=E2=80=9D in the reasoning. This ri=
gorous feedback loop was crucial: a version of the model trained without fo=
rmal verification signals could generate plausible-looking proofs that were=
 actually wrong. In contrast, Seed-Prover=E2=80=99s proofs are guaranteed c=
orrect by construction, instilling new confidence in AI-driven mathematics.
Why does it matter? Mathematics has long been a litmus test for intelligenc=
e, since it requires abstract thinking, creativity, and flawless logic =E2=
=80=93 far beyond regurgitating patterns from data. By effectively bridging=
 LLMs with formal methods, Seed-Prover shows a viable path to overcoming th=
e reliability issues of =E2=80=9Cblack-box=E2=80=9D neural reasoning. The s=
ystem=E2=80=99s lemma-by-lemma approach also makes its reasoning more inter=
pretable (each proved lemma is a verifiable milestone), pointing toward AI =
that not only reaches correct answers but can explain and justify them step=
 by step. Practically, these techniques could transform fields like softwar=
e verification, engineering, and pure math research: AI assistants may soon=
 help discover new proofs or check the correctness of others=E2=80=99 work.=
 Moreover, the success on IMO problems =E2=80=93 often seen as requiring tr=
ue ingenuity =E2=80=93 is an uplifting sign that AI might eventually tackle=
 open mathematical conjectures. Seed-Prover underscores the power of hybrid=
 systems that combine the strengths of neural networks (flexible reasoning)=
 with symbolic systems (exact verification), and it pushes us one step clos=
er to AI that can =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=80=9D through the toughest problems in =
a human-like yet superhuman way.
3. Self-Questioning Language Models
Watching: Self-Questioning LMs (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/8522a=
bdf-60e6-428c-aa5a-a711bb2906d8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Today=E2=80=99s LLMs typically learn from fixed=
 datasets curated by humans, which limits their growth. Once trained, they =
passively rely on user prompts or additional fine-tuning =E2=80=93 they don=
=E2=80=99t actively ask new questions on their own. In contrast, humans (an=
d especially researchers) often learn by self-questioning: we pose ourselve=
s problems, attempt solutions, identify gaps, and try again. The question h=
ere: Can an AI improve its reasoning abilities by generating and answering =
its own questions? If so, an LLM could continuously sharpen itself without =
needing constant human-provided training data. This would also help address=
 the =E2=80=9Cdata bottleneck=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 high-quality instruction t=
uning data is expensive to obtain =E2=80=93 and could mitigate issues like =
models drifting when fine-tuned only on user-facing style rather than under=
lying problem-solving skills.
How does it solve the problem? The authors propose an asymmetric self-play =
framework called Self-Questioning LMs (SQLM). They create two roles from a =
single pre-trained model: a =E2=80=9CProposer=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9CSolve=
r.=E2=80=9D The Proposer takes a general topic or domain (for example, =E2=
=80=9Cthree-digit multiplication=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Calgebra word problems=
=E2=80=9D) and generates a question that an expert in that domain should be=
 able to solve. The Solver then tries to answer the Proposer=E2=80=99s ques=
tion. Because these roles are played by the same underlying model, the syst=
em essentially tasks itself with challenges. The interaction is driven by r=
einforcement learning: if the Proposer=E2=80=99s question is too easy or to=
o hard, it gets a low reward =E2=80=93 it should pose questions that are so=
lvable but non-trivial. The Solver, on the other hand, is rewarded for prod=
ucing correct answers, but since there=E2=80=99s no external answer key, co=
rrectness is gauged via self-consistency (e.g. majority voting among multip=
le attempts). For coding tasks, the Proposer generates unit tests as =E2=80=
=9Cquestions,=E2=80=9D and the Solver writes code that must pass those test=
s. Over many rounds of this self-play, the model adapts: the Proposer learn=
s to craft more and more interesting, challenging questions (because trivia=
l ones yield no reward), and the Solver correspondingly improves by tacklin=
g them. The key is that no external data or human evaluation is needed =E2=
=80=93 the model=E2=80=99s own ability to solve or not solve a question pro=
vides the learning signal.
What are the key findings? Using this method, a base language model was abl=
e to significantly improve its performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks=
 without any new human-labeled data. For instance, starting from a model al=
ready good at math, the self-questioning training boosted its accuracy on 3=
-digit multiplication and algebra problems (from the OMEGA benchmark) beyon=
d the original capabilities =E2=80=93 solely through the model=E2=80=99s ne=
wly acquired habit of proposing tricky problems to itself and solving them.=
 On Codeforces programming challenges, the model similarly became better at=
 generating correct solutions after iteratively testing itself with unit-te=
st questions. An interesting qualitative observation: as training progresse=
d, the Proposer began generating questions that curriculum-like increased i=
n difficulty, mirroring how a human teacher might start with simpler tasks =
and ramp up to harder ones as the student improves. This automatic curricul=
um happened without explicit scheduling =E2=80=93 it emerged from the rewar=
d setup (easy questions quickly saturate the Solver=E2=80=99s performance, =
so to get higher reward the Proposer had to make the questions harder over =
time). The study also found that the model, through self-play, discovered g=
aps in its own knowledge and then filled them: for example, if it was weak =
on a certain pattern of word problem, it would eventually generate those ca=
ses and learn from them. Overall, the self-trained model matched or surpass=
ed the performance of models fine-tuned on thousands of human-written promp=
ts, highlighting that a sufficiently intelligent model can be its own best =
teacher under the right setup.
Why does it matter? Self-Questioning LMs hint at a future where AI systems =
can continuously improve themselves by creating their own training curricul=
um. This could drastically reduce the need for large-scale human annotation=
 when refining models for complex reasoning tasks, making the improvement p=
rocess more scalable and autonomous. It=E2=80=99s also a step towards addre=
ssing the alignment problem: a model that learns through self-posed queries=
 could potentially identify flaws in its reasoning or harmful responses by =
=E2=80=9Cthinking out loud=E2=80=9D and then correcting itself, all interna=
lly. In reinforcement learning terms, this is like having the model generat=
e its own environment for skill acquisition =E2=80=93 a concept that has le=
d to huge breakthroughs in games (e.g. AlphaGo=E2=80=99s self-play). Applyi=
ng it to general reasoning is novel and powerful. Moreover, this approach o=
pens up a new paradigm for LLM training beyond next-token prediction: using=
 the model=E2=80=99s internal consistency (can it solve what it asks?) as a=
 training signal. It could inspire other asymmetric self-play setups (imagi=
ne a =E2=80=9Ccritic=E2=80=9D model that generates tricky corner cases for =
a =E2=80=9Cdebater=E2=80=9D model to tackle, etc.). Ultimately, Self-Questi=
oning LMs represent a move toward autonomous research agents =E2=80=93 AI t=
hat not only solves problems but figures out which problems to practice on =
to become smarter. And perhaps one day, such agents will pose and solve sci=
entific questions that humans haven=E2=80=99t even thought to ask.

d agents. Agent Lightning cleanly decouples agent decision-making from trai=
ning: it treats an agent=E2=80=99s action trajectory as a Markov Decision P=
rocess and introduces a unified data interface plus a hierarchical RL algor=
ithm (LightningRL) for credit assignment. This allows one to plug in agents=
 built with LangChain, AutoGen, etc., and improve them via RL without custo=

MRMPOw0 ]: Proposes a clever technique to improve an LLM=E2=80=99s adherenc=

ff: models tuned heavily for chain-of-thought reasoning can become less fol=
lowable. They leverage the model=E2=80=99s own internal signals (e.g. likel=
iness of following instructions in its reasoning trace) as a self-supervise=
d reward. By applying RL on these signals, the model significantly improved=
 its instruction-following ability while retaining its reasoning prowess. I=
n short, it aligned itself better to user prompts without sacrificing probl=

ors propose an </span><strong>asymmetric self-play framework</strong><span>=
 called </span><strong>Self-Questioning LMs (SQLM)</strong><span>. They cre=
ate two roles from a single pre-trained model: a </span><strong>=E2=80=9CPr=
oposer=E2=80=9D</strong><span> and a </span><strong>=E2=80=9CSolver.=E2=80=
=9D</strong><span> The Proposer takes a general </span><em>topic</em><span>=
 or domain (for example, =E2=80=9Cthree-digit multiplication=E2=80=9D or =
=E2=80=9Calgebra word problems=E2=80=9D) and generates a question that an e=
xpert in that domain should be able to solve. The Solver then tries to answ=
er the Proposer=E2=80=99s question. Because these roles are played by the s=
ame underlying model, the system essentially tasks itself with challenges. =
The interaction is driven by reinforcement learning: if the Proposer=E2=80=
=99s question is </span><em>too easy</em><span> or </span><em>too hard</em>=
<span>, it gets a low reward =E2=80=93 it should pose questions that are so=
lvable but non-trivial. The Solver, on the other hand, is rewarded for prod=
ucing correct answers, but since there=E2=80=99s no external answer key, co=
rrectness is gauged via </span><em>self-consistency</em><span> (e.g. majori=
ty voting among multiple attempts). For coding tasks, the Proposer generate=
s unit tests as =E2=80=9Cquestions,=E2=80=9D and the Solver writes code tha=
t must pass those tests. Over many rounds of this self-play, the model adap=
ts: the Proposer learns to craft more and more interesting, challenging que=
stions (because trivial ones yield no reward), and the Solver corresponding=
ly improves by tackling them. The key is that </span><strong>no external da=

to </span><strong>significantly improve its performance on multiple reasoni=

rough the model=E2=80=99s newly acquired habit of proposing tricky problems=

 </span><em>curriculum-like</em><span> increased in difficulty, mirroring h=
ow a human teacher might start with simpler tasks and ramp up to harder one=

uickly saturate the Solver=E2=80=99s performance, so to get higher reward t=

nd that the model, through self-play, discovered gaps in its own knowledge =
and then filled them: for example, if it was weak on a certain pattern of w=
ord problem, it would eventually generate those cases and learn from them. =
Overall, the self-trained model matched or surpassed the performance of mod=
