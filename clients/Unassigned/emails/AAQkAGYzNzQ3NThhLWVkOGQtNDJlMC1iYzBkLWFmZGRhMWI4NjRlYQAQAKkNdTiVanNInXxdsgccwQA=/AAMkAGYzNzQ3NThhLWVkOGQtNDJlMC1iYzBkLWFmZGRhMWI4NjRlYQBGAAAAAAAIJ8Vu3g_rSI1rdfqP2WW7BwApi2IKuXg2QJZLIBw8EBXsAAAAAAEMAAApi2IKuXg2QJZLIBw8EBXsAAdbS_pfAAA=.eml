MODERN WARFIGHTING AND THE DECLINE OF THE COLD WAR DOCTRINE [3]
THE AGE OF MASS IS OVER.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
For more than a generation, the international system was organized along the lines of the Cold War. Though the United States and the Soviet Union were the primary belligerents in the conflict, the
foreign policies of nearly all nations were conceived through the lens of the Cold War. Naturally, this resulted in a bespoke military doctrine.
The doctrine was built for a specific kind of war: one fought between industrial superpowers across well-defined fronts with massive armies, heavy armor and deep logistical lines. It assumed time to
mobilize, the ability to mass forces and relatively secure rear areas. Military power was measured in divisions, tanks and firepower. Volume mattered more than precision.
This model fit the structure of a bipolar world, one characterized by static alliance blocs, clearly defined borders and predictable escalation patterns. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the model persisted. Without a near-peer threat to force structural change, the U.S. retained its global garrison posture and logistics-heavy force design. The post-9/11 wars reinforced large-scale
logistics networks, forward operating bases and centralized command structures – keeping the Cold War logic alive even in asymmetric environments. Yet even in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the
adversary lacked mass and maneuverability, the U.S. often relied on static bases, armored patrols and top-down command. This mismatch between Cold War force design and irregular threats undermined
long-term strategic success. Conventional formations and centralized logistics sustained the fight, but they encouraged static operations, predictable patterns and strategic rigidity.
But the 21st-century battlefield has changed. The proliferation of precision-guided munitions, persistent satellite and drone surveillance, and the rise of cyber and electronic warfare have rendered
massed forces vulnerable before they engage. Enemies can now strike deep, they can blind command and control networks, and they can expose large formations in real time. Rear areas are no longer
sanctuaries; they are targets.
Recent conflicts, especially in Ukraine and in the Indo-Pacific, have accelerated this shift. The era of mass is giving way to mobility, deception and integrated kill chains. The new model demands
dispersion, survivability and digital integration across contested domains.
OBSOLESCENCE
The Cold War model was rooted not only in doctrine, but in force structure and geography. Victory depended on the ability to deploy and sustain large, heavily equipped formations – divisions of
troops, tanks, artillery and support units – operating from permanent garrisons and supplied by centralized logistics hubs. Military success rested on the ability to overwhelm adversaries through
depth and firepower.
Strategic geography reinforced the model. Battlefields were envisioned as linear and static, centered on chokepoints for enemy thrusts. U.S. and allied forces were forward-deployed in fixed positions,
relying on geographic predictability to deter aggression and enable rapid response. But this rigidity locked force posture into brittle assumptions about the predictability of geography, time to
mobilize and rear safety.
These assumptions shaped the doctrines that followed. The U.S. AirLand Battle doctrine, for example, replaced the short-lived Active Defense doctrine of the 1970s, which focused on stopping a Soviet
assault through linear defense. Active Defense was widely seen as too static and attritional, prompting the Army to adopt a more aggressive, deep-strike concept in 1982. AirLand Battle did not replace
the logic of mass; it refined it. Despite its focus on simultaneity and deep strikes, it still assumed conventional formations, secure communications and uncontested logistics corridors. Its
operational effectiveness depended on centralized decision-making and structured battlespaces – conditions increasingly incompatible with a transparent, strike-saturated environment.
Following the Cold War, AirLand Battle evolved into Full-Spectrum Operations, formalized in 2001 to encompass peace enforcement, stability operations and conventional combat. But the foundational
logic of mass, centralized logistics and domain-specific command endured. It still worked because it still functioned under the conditions of rear-area security, uncontested air dominance and
prolonged timelines for buildup. The U.S. military retained its global garrison posture and legacy systems because no near-peer threat forced doctrinal or structural overhaul. Instead, Cold War-era
systems were repurposed for new missions from the Balkans to Iraq and Afghanistan, reinforcing large operating bases, long logistical tails and centralized control. The model’s utility sufficed for
the demands of protracted occupations in the post-9/11 wars, though over time it became increasingly clear that the model no longer matched the emerging threat environment.

_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
The result was an obsolete force model optimized for an obsolete kind of warfare. The Cold War model was designed for opacity, sanctuary and scale. Continuous surveillance, precision weapons and
rapid-strike capabilities have collapsed the window for buildup and erased the rear as a safe zone. The Cold War model’s strength, its mass, has become a liability under modern conditions that
demand transparency and speed.
The information environment has fundamentally changed too. Cold War-era concealment and deception were viable at scale. Satellite coverage was infrequent, resolution limited and tactical intelligence
slow. Today’s battlespace, saturated as it is with commercial ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) platforms, drones and open-source intelligence, renders operational security and
surprise nearly obsolete. Large movements are now detectable, and logistics networks are exposed in real time.
New domains have emerged to exploit these vulnerabilities. Cyber and electronic warfare now target the connective tissue of modern militaries: logistics networks, command systems and decision
architecture.
Warfare today favors speed, dispersion and digital adaptation. The Russia-Ukraine war has tested the Cold War model in real time and exposed its vulnerabilities. Russia entered the conflict with a
doctrine rooted in Soviet-era operational logic despite being tactically modernized with drones, electronic warfare and some networking. Ukrainian forces, backed by Western ISR and precision weapons,
operated with agility and dispersion, targeting Russian formations, depots and command and control nodes in real time. Rear areas proved vulnerable. Electronic warfare blinded drones and severed
communications. Both sides found that mass without survivability led to losses, and movement without concealment invited strikes. The limited maneuver on the battlefield reflects not stagnation but
the collapse of assumptions that once enabled large-scale operations.
That the Russia-Ukraine war has featured trench lines, artillery duels and territorial attrition has invited comparisons to 20th-century warfare, but the comparison is misleading. The war is not a
revival of Cold War doctrine; it is a transitional conflict that reveals why the legacy model no longer holds. Ukraine’s ability to hold ground has depended not on mass but on agility, decentralized
kill chains and rapid adaptation. The Russia-Ukraine war is instructive not because attrition returned but because it is now shaped by precision and transparency.
In this environment, relying on the Cold War model is no longer just inefficient – it's operationally dangerous. Recognizing the vulnerabilities of legacy force structures in a transparent,
high-threat environment, the United States has begun reorienting its military doctrine and operational concepts toward survivability, dispersion and cross-domain integration. This new model reflects a
fundamental shift in how military power is generated, sustained and applied under conditions of nonstop surveillance, cyber disruption and long-range targeting capabilities.
REFORM
The U.S. military has thus undertaken structural and doctrinal reforms to reduce its dependence on mass and static infrastructure while increasing its ability to operate in contested, data-rich
environments. The Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment concept emphasizes rapid dispersal to austere or civilian airfields, mobile support teams and pre-positioned fuel and munitions. It’s designed
to complicate adversary targeting and ensure continuity of air operations under missile or electromagnetic threat. The concept is already being stress-tested in exercises like REFORPAC 2025, the
largest Air Force Pacific drill in decades, involving more than 300 aircraft in more than 50 locations to demonstrate real-time dispersed operations across six time zones.
The Marine Corps, through Force Design 2030, has restructured around archipelagic and littoral warfare, marking a shift from its recent use as a second land army. Tanks and heavy artillery are being
phased out in favor of Marine Littoral Regiments – small, highly mobile units capable of operating inside contested maritime zones and executing distributed kill chains. These forces are optimized
for speed, low signature and integration with naval and joint fires.
The U.S. Army’s Multi-Domain Operations doctrine treats land, air, space, cyber and the electromagnetic spectrum as a single, integrated battlespace. It prioritizes long-range precision fire,
cross-domain maneuver and real-time data flows to achieve decision advantage. Instead of traditional armored thrusts, dispersed units leverage sensors and networks to deny or disrupt adversary
capabilities before close contact.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has embraced Distributed Maritime Operations to increase fleet survivability and operational unpredictability. This includes a growing role for smaller combatants, unmanned
platforms and decentralized command and control.
The Competitive Endurance doctrine the Space Force uses recognizes space as a domain that is no longer safe due to anti-satellite weapons. Its strategy emphasizes resilience through satellite
disaggregation, reconstitution and integration with joint and commercial space networks to maintain access under contested conditions.
At the institutional level, the Department of Defense is investing in Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and its multinational counterpart (CJADC2), replacing legacy hierarchical systems
with dynamic sensor-to-shooter networks. These architectures aim to connect platforms and units across services, allies and domains in real time, enabling faster targeting cycles and decentralized
decision-making.
The doctrinal shift underway is already being operationalized through defense-industrial adaptation. The Pentagon’s pivot toward resilient, modular and software-defined systems is reshaping
procurement priorities. Legacy acquisition timelines are under pressure as services demand systems that can be updated rapidly, deployed flexibly and scaled across dispersed formations. The emphasis
on unmanned systems, open architectures and multi-mission payloads reflects a growing alignment between operational concepts and industrial capacity. Recent legislation, including the “Big Beautiful
Bill” and its Section 2000-series authorities, reinforces this momentum by expanding multiyear procurement to support high-attrition next-generation systems.
THE FUTURE
These efforts are paving the way for a fundamentally different force design. The U.S. and its allies are now building for wars defined by speed, dispersion and integration. This does not mean mass is
irrelevant. As the Russia-Ukraine war has shown, total force size and sustained manpower still matter, but mass can no longer be concentrated as it once was. Survivability now requires dispersing mass
across networks, nodes and domains to avoid detection and destruction.
In a world where satellites and long-range strike capabilities compress time and erase freedom of maneuver on the rear lines, military advantage belongs to those who can sense, decide and act faster
than their adversary. Power is measured by the speed and resilience of networks connecting sensors, shooters and decision-makers across domains.
Future forces will be dispersed, mobile and low-signature, constantly shifting configurations to complicate enemy targeting. Drones, autonomous platforms and modular ISR systems will dominate ISR and
strike missions. Kill chains will prioritize small, adaptable units able to plug into joint networks and deliver effects in seconds rather than hours. Large, permanent bases will give way to flexible
“lily pad” networks that support distributed operations from austere locations.
Strategically, the model demands more than new platforms. It requires reimagining command and control: data-centric architectures, automated decision aids and AI-augmented targeting to function in
high-tempo environments. Rather than seeking dominance in a single domain, the goal is cross-domain advantage where space, cyber and the electromagnetic spectrum shape outcomes on land and sea before
the first shot is fired.
But doctrine alone cannot drive this shift. It also requires an industrial base designed for scale, speed and adaptability. Systems like loitering munitions, counter-drone platforms and mobile
logistics kits are essential, but they cannot be built on Cold War-era procurement timelines. The age of mass is over. The age of maneuver, networks and resilience has begun. Strategy and structure
must match reality.

														</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For more than a ge=
neration, the international system was organized along the lines of the Col=
d War. Though the United States and the Soviet Union were the primary belli=
gerents in the conflict, the foreign policies of nearly all nations were co=
nceived through the lens of the Cold War. Naturally, this resulted in a bes=
poke military doctrine.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The doctrine was b=
uilt for a specific kind of war: one fought between industrial superpowers =
across well-defined fronts with massive armies, heavy armor and deep logist=
ical lines. It assumed time to mobilize, the ability to mass forces and rel=
atively secure rear areas. Military power was measured in divisions, tanks =
and firepower. Volume mattered more than precision.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This model fit the=
 structure of a bipolar world, one characterized by static alliance blocs, =
clearly defined borders and predictable escalation patterns. Even after the=
 collapse of the Soviet Union, the model persisted. Without a near-peer thr=
eat to force structural change, the U.S. retained its global garrison postu=
re and logistics-heavy force design. The post-9/11 wars reinforced large-sc=
ale logistics networks, forward operating bases and centralized command str=
uctures =E2=80=93 keeping the Cold War logic alive even in asymmetric envir=
onments. Yet even in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the adversary lacked mass =
and maneuverability, the U.S. often relied on static bases, armored patrols=
 and top-down command. This mismatch between Cold War force design and irre=
gular threats undermined long-term strategic success. Conventional formatio=
ns and centralized logistics sustained the fight, but they encouraged stati=
c operations, predictable patterns and strategic rigidity.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But the 21st-centu=
ry battlefield has changed. The proliferation of precision-guided munitions=
, persistent satellite and drone surveillance, and the rise of cyber and el=
ectronic warfare have rendered massed forces vulnerable before they engage.=
 Enemies can now strike deep, they can blind command and control networks, =
and they can expose large formations in real time. Rear areas are no longer=
 sanctuaries; they are targets.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Recent conflicts, =
especially in Ukraine and in the Indo-Pacific, have accelerated this shift.=
 The era of mass is giving way to mobility, deception and integrated kill c=
hains. The new model demands dispersion, survivability and digital integrat=
ion across contested domains.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Obsolescen=
ce</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Cold War model=
 was rooted not only in doctrine, but in force structure and geography. Vic=
tory depended on the ability to deploy and sustain large, heavily equipped =
formations =E2=80=93 divisions of troops, tanks, artillery and support unit=
s =E2=80=93 operating from permanent garrisons and supplied by centralized =
logistics hubs. Military success rested on the ability to overwhelm adversa=
ries through depth and firepower.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Strategic geograph=
y reinforced the model. Battlefields were envisioned as linear and static, =
centered on chokepoints for enemy thrusts. U.S. and allied forces were forw=
ard-deployed in fixed positions, relying on geographic predictability to de=
ter aggression and enable rapid response. But this rigidity locked force po=
sture into brittle assumptions about the predictability of geography, time =
to mobilize and rear safety.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These assumptions =
shaped the doctrines that followed. The U.S. AirLand Battle doctrine, for e=
xample, replaced the short-lived Active Defense doctrine of the 1970s, whic=
h focused on stopping a Soviet assault through linear defense. Active Defen=
se was widely seen as too static and attritional, prompting the Army to ado=
pt a more aggressive, deep-strike concept in 1982. AirLand Battle did not r=
eplace the logic of mass; it refined it. Despite its focus on simultaneity =
and deep strikes, it still assumed conventional formations, secure communic=
ations and uncontested logistics corridors. Its operational effectiveness d=
epended on centralized decision-making and structured battlespaces =E2=80=
=93 conditions increasingly incompatible with a transparent, strike-saturat=
ed environment.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Following the Cold=
 War, AirLand Battle evolved into Full-Spectrum Operations, formalized in 2=
001 to encompass peace enforcement, stability operations and conventional c=
ombat. But the foundational logic of mass, centralized logistics and domain=
-specific command endured. It still worked because it still functioned unde=
r the conditions of rear-area security, uncontested air dominance and prolo=
nged timelines for buildup. The U.S. military retained its global garrison =
posture and legacy systems because no near-peer threat forced doctrinal or =
structural overhaul. Instead, Cold War-era systems were repurposed for new =
missions from the Balkans to Iraq and Afghanistan, reinforcing large operat=
ing bases, long logistical tails and centralized control. The model=E2=80=
=99s utility sufficed for the demands of protracted occupations in the post=
-9/11 wars, though over time it became increasingly clear that the model no=
 longer matched the emerging threat environment.</p>

</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The result was an =
obsolete force model optimized for an obsolete kind of warfare. The Cold Wa=
r model was designed for opacity, sanctuary and scale. Continuous surveilla=
nce, precision weapons and rapid-strike capabilities have collapsed the win=
dow for buildup and erased the rear as a safe zone. The Cold War model=E2=
=80=99s strength, its mass, has become a liability under modern conditions =
that demand transparency and speed.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The information en=
vironment has fundamentally changed too. Cold War-era concealment and decep=
tion were viable at scale. Satellite coverage was infrequent, resolution li=
mited and tactical intelligence slow. Today=E2=80=99s battlespace, saturate=
d as it is with commercial ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissan=
ce) platforms, drones and open-source intelligence, renders operational sec=
urity and surprise nearly obsolete. Large movements are now detectable, and=
 logistics networks are exposed in real time.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">New domains have e=
merged to exploit these vulnerabilities. Cyber and electronic warfare now t=
arget the connective tissue of modern militaries: logistics networks, comma=
nd systems and decision architecture.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Warfare today favo=
rs speed, dispersion and digital adaptation. The Russia-Ukraine war has tes=
ted the Cold War model in real time and exposed its vulnerabilities. Russia=
 entered the conflict with a doctrine rooted in Soviet-era operational logi=
c despite being tactically modernized with drones, electronic warfare and s=
ome networking. Ukrainian forces, backed by Western ISR and precision weapo=
ns, operated with agility and dispersion, targeting Russian formations, dep=
ots and command and control nodes in real time. Rear areas proved vulnerabl=
e. Electronic warfare blinded drones and severed communications. Both sides=
 found that mass without survivability led to losses, and movement without =
concealment invited strikes. The limited maneuver on the battlefield reflec=
ts not stagnation but the collapse of assumptions that once enabled large-s=
cale operations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">That the Russia-Uk=
raine war has featured trench lines, artillery duels and territorial attrit=
ion has invited comparisons to 20th-century warfare, but the comparison is =
misleading. The war is not a revival of Cold War doctrine; it is a transiti=
onal conflict that reveals why the legacy model no longer holds. Ukraine=E2=
=80=99s ability to hold ground has depended not on mass but on agility, dec=
entralized kill chains and rapid adaptation. The Russia-Ukraine war is inst=
ructive not because attrition returned but because it is now shaped by prec=
ision and transparency.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In this environmen=
t, relying on the Cold War model is no longer just inefficient =E2=80=93 it=
's operationally dangerous. Recognizing the vulnerabilities of legacy force=
 structures in a transparent, high-threat environment, the United States ha=
s begun reorienting its military doctrine and operational concepts toward s=
urvivability, dispersion and cross-domain integration. This new model refle=
cts a fundamental shift in how military power is generated, sustained and a=
pplied under conditions of nonstop surveillance, cyber disruption and long-=
range targeting capabilities.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Reform</st=
rong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. military =
has thus undertaken structural and doctrinal reforms to reduce its dependen=
ce on mass and static infrastructure while increasing its ability to operat=
e in contested, data-rich environments. The Air Force=E2=80=99s Agile Comba=
t Employment concept emphasizes rapid dispersal to austere or civilian airf=
ields, mobile support teams and pre-positioned fuel and munitions. It=E2=80=
=99s designed to complicate adversary targeting and ensure continuity of ai=
r operations under missile or electromagnetic threat. The concept is alread=
y being stress-tested in exercises like REFORPAC 2025, the largest Air Forc=
e Pacific drill in decades, involving more than 300 aircraft in more than 5=
0 locations to demonstrate real-time dispersed operations across six time z=
ones.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Marine Corps, =
through Force Design 2030, has restructured around archipelagic and littora=
l warfare, marking a shift from its recent use as a second land army. Tanks=
 and heavy artillery are being phased out in favor of Marine Littoral Regim=
ents =E2=80=93 small, highly mobile units capable of operating inside conte=
sted maritime zones and executing distributed kill chains. These forces are=
 optimized for speed, low signature and integration with naval and joint fi=
res.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. Army=E2=
=80=99s Multi-Domain Operations doctrine treats land, air, space, cyber and=
 the electromagnetic spectrum as a single, integrated battlespace. It prior=
itizes long-range precision fire, cross-domain maneuver and real-time data =
flows to achieve decision advantage. Instead of traditional armored thrusts=
, dispersed units leverage sensors and networks to deny or disrupt adversar=
y capabilities before close contact.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, the U.S=
. Navy has embraced Distributed Maritime Operations to increase fleet survi=
vability and operational unpredictability. This includes a growing role for=
 smaller combatants, unmanned platforms and decentralized command and contr=
ol.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Competitive En=
durance doctrine the Space Force uses recognizes space as a domain that is =
no longer safe due to anti-satellite weapons. Its strategy emphasizes resil=
ience through satellite disaggregation, reconstitution and integration with=
 joint and commercial space networks to maintain access under contested con=
ditions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">At the institution=
al level, the Department of Defense is investing in Joint All-Domain Comman=
d and Control (JADC2) and its multinational counterpart (CJADC2), replacing=
 legacy hierarchical systems with dynamic sensor-to-shooter networks. These=
 architectures aim to connect platforms and units across services, allies a=
nd domains in real time, enabling faster targeting cycles and decentralized=
 decision-making.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The doctrinal shif=
t underway is already being operationalized through defense-industrial adap=
tation. The Pentagon=E2=80=99s pivot toward resilient, modular and software=
-defined systems is reshaping procurement priorities. Legacy acquisition ti=
melines are under pressure as services demand systems that can be updated r=
apidly, deployed flexibly and scaled across dispersed formations. The empha=
sis on unmanned systems, open architectures and multi-mission payloads refl=
ects a growing alignment between operational concepts and industrial capaci=
ty. Recent legislation, including the =E2=80=9CBig Beautiful Bill=E2=80=9D =
and its Section 2000-series authorities, reinforces this momentum by expand=
ing multiyear procurement to support high-attrition next-generation systems=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The Future=
</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These efforts are =
paving the way for a fundamentally different force design. The U.S. and its=
 allies are now building for wars defined by speed, dispersion and integrat=
ion. This does not mean mass is irrelevant. As the Russia-Ukraine war has s=
hown, total force size and sustained manpower still matter, but mass can no=
 longer be concentrated as it once was. Survivability now requires dispersi=
ng mass across networks, nodes and domains to avoid detection and destructi=
on.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In a world where s=
atellites and long-range strike capabilities compress time and erase freedo=
m of maneuver on the rear lines, military advantage belongs to those who ca=
n sense, decide and act faster than their adversary. Power is measured by t=
he speed and resilience of networks connecting sensors, shooters and decisi=
on-makers across domains.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Future forces will=
 be dispersed, mobile and low-signature, constantly shifting configurations=
 to complicate enemy targeting. Drones, autonomous platforms and modular IS=
R systems will dominate ISR and strike missions. Kill chains will prioritiz=
e small, adaptable units able to plug into joint networks and deliver effec=
ts in seconds rather than hours. Large, permanent bases will give way to fl=
exible =E2=80=9Clily pad=E2=80=9D networks that support distributed operati=
ons from austere locations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Strategically, the=
 model demands more than new platforms. It requires reimagining command and=
 control: data-centric architectures, automated decision aids and AI-augmen=
ted targeting to function in high-tempo environments. Rather than seeking d=
ominance in a single domain, the goal is cross-domain advantage where space=
, cyber and the electromagnetic spectrum shape outcomes on land and sea bef=
ore the first shot is fired.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But doctrine alone=
 cannot drive this shift. It also requires an industrial base designed for =
scale, speed and adaptability. Systems like loitering munitions, counter-dr=
one platforms and mobile logistics kits are essential, but they cannot be b=
uilt on Cold War-era procurement timelines. The age of mass is over. The ag=
e of maneuver, networks and resilience has begun. Strategy and structure mu=
st match reality.</p>
