GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: AI IN ANALYSIS, MILITARY SPENDING AS A PATH TO PEACE [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
_Question: Hi George. Please, no more AI-generated articles! They lack the insight and brevity normally associated with your team. This is the fifth or sixth in the last month. Please please, no
more._
Response: My answer to this comment was, “To be polite, you are mistaken. You can imagine what my impolite answer might be.” In truth, the use of artificial intelligence by students in
universities and analysts in my shop represents the damage AI technologists can cause – in this case, creating an atmosphere of distrust in matters such as this, with a reader accusing one of my
staff of plagiarism. AI is an extreme form of plagiarism. Plagiarism was traditionally the theft of another person’s ideas. Artificial intelligence is the theft of small parts of many people’s
thoughts strung together. The total theft of one person’s ideas is illegal and known as copyright infringement. The theft of many people’s ideas strung together seems not to be illegal.
When I was a professor years ago, plagiarism was an ever-present possibility. The problem was not the theft itself but the fact that the student was avoiding the difficult process of learning. That is
the problem of AI now, which universities often encounter: How can we know if the paper submitted by the student was actually written by the student?
The solution is quite simple, and rarely used by professors. In the classroom or an office, the professor should tell the student that he has written a superb paper and ask if he has any further
thoughts on a statement made in the essay. If the student were the true author, he would have something to say. If he plagiarized it, he would be silent or gibbering. In class, I would ask other
questions and publicly show the student’s lack of knowledge if the work was not his own. The academic fear of AI is simply the result of laziness or indifference on the part of professors.
Discussing assignments with students will reveal if they were plagiarized. The problem in academia is that tenures and promotions are awarded based on the number of articles published in the Journal
of Obscure Studies, and not based on how well you teach.
At Geopolitical Futures, we hold a meeting of all our analysts around the world at 9 a.m. central time, every weekday. At these meetings, the director of analysis organizes the information gathered in
the past 24 hours by all the analysts and centers the meeting around it. All analysts who submitted intelligence then present and explain why it matters and how it fits or doesn’t fit into our
model. Then comes the best part where I get involved by challenging their analysis, demanding more detail or giving my own analysis. This makes them frustrated and uncomfortable. It makes me feel good
and is essential for analysis. The whole team gets the same treatment, including me.
All articles, as they are written, are distributed to all analysts and critiqued as necessary. Then the editors take over, smooth out the rough parts to make them more understandable, do a fact check
and, as needed, make sure they are grammatically sound, as English is a second language for most of our global analysts. Our team speaks over 20 languages, which helps them avoid missing small but
important points that a non-native speaker might overlook. Our graphics team creates maps or charts to help visually explain the main points in the analysis. The final step is a copy edit, and then
the analysis gets published. A long way from automation.
So to answer the reader, anyone simply using AI to write, especially in universities, would rapidly be detected by their inability to explain and defend a point. Plagiarism in all of its forms is
detectable by anyone who can discuss a paper with the author. But publication of the article for the Journal of Obscure Studies might be delayed, along with tenure!
-------------------------
_Question: The Trump administration’s success in getting the various NATO countries and Japan to increase their military spending to 5 percent of their GDP should be applauded on the grounds of
geopolitical fairness. However, there is the concern that as you expand, the “military industrial complex” may create global conflicts. Does this worry you over the longer term? Could it recreate
an arms race?_
Response: During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union spent vast amounts of money on nuclear weapons and technology to detect threats and defend against them, as well as retaliate.
There was no nuclear war. The creation of substantial military power decreases, in my mind, the possibility of war. Nations that start wars are less likely to do so if there is a significant
possibility of being defeated. Wars start when a nation believes it runs little risk of losing. The great guarantor of peace is balanced and significant military power, known to other nations. It is
important to be publicly and honestly able to demonstrate power. Hitler invaded Russia because he saw it as weak. The U.S. and Russia never fought a war because each understood the power of the other.
If we had understood the power of the North Vietnamese, we would never have gone to war. But the key is to have a clear understanding of what power consists of in different circumstances.
-------------------------
ON THE UPCOMING TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMIT AND TARIFFS ON INDIA [4]
Aug. 11, 2025
_Question: Why does George have so much conviction over the “depth of defense against NATO” concept. After all that’s come out, this seems an untenable point of view. And does the timing really
matter for a peace deal to be achieved? How can one be so sure Trump will not get played by Putin?_
Response: In order to understand war, or anything for that matter, you must understand how it began. The war in Ukraine began with President Vladimir Putin’s fear of a threat from the West. It
continued when Putin failed to achieve his goal of building a buffer. Putin had two reasons to continue the war. One was the hope that in the long run, he could occupy Ukraine. The second was the
knowledge that ending the war without success would be a political catastrophe for him inside Russia. The many dead Russians, the severe damage to the economy (which many Russians expected to flourish
after the collapse of the Soviet Union), the attempted coup by the Wagner group – all these outcomes make a peace agreement for Putin very difficult.
If we look at how and why the war began and at what the Russians expected and what actually happened, we can understand Putin’s unwillingness to make peace in these circumstances. Peace with only a
small part of Ukraine in Russian hands would mean that much was lost for very little. It would also mean that Putin failed. His actions in these talks strike me as the actions of a desperate man. The
end of the war under these circumstances is dangerous for Putin himself. So the end of the war depends on the United States threatening greater damage for Russia – which, bluff or not, strengthens
the hand of Russians wanting an end to the conflict. But if we don’t remember the reason the war began, we will not understand the situation Russia finds itself in now, or why Putin acts as he does.

eorge. Please, no more AI-generated articles! They lack the insight and bre=
vity normally associated with your team. This is the fifth or sixth in the =
last month. Please please, no more.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: My answe=
r to this comment was, =E2=80=9CTo be polite, you are mistaken. You can ima=
gine what my impolite answer might be.=E2=80=9D In truth, the use of artifi=
cial intelligence by students in universities and analysts in my shop repre=
sents the damage AI technologists can cause =E2=80=93 in this case, creatin=
g an atmosphere of distrust in matters such as this, with a reader accusing=
 one of my staff of plagiarism. AI is an extreme form of plagiarism. Plagia=
rism was traditionally the theft of another person=E2=80=99s ideas. Artific=
ial intelligence is the theft of small parts of many people=E2=80=99s thoug=
hts strung together. The total theft of one person=E2=80=99s ideas is illeg=
al and known as copyright infringement. The theft of many people=E2=80=99s =
ideas strung together seems not to be illegal.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">When I was a profe=
ssor years ago, plagiarism was an ever-present possibility. The problem was=
 not the theft itself but the fact that the student was avoiding the diffic=
ult process of learning. That is the problem of AI now, which universities =
often encounter: How can we know if the paper submitted by the student was =
actually written by the student?</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The solution is qu=
ite simple, and rarely used by professors. In the classroom or an office, t=
he professor should tell the student that he has written a superb paper and=
 ask if he has any further thoughts on a statement made in the essay. If th=
e student were the true author, he would have something to say. If he plagi=
arized it, he would be silent or gibbering. In class, I would ask other que=
stions and publicly show the student=E2=80=99s lack of knowledge if the wor=
k was not his own. The academic fear of AI is simply the result of laziness=
 or indifference on the part of professors. Discussing assignments with stu=
dents will reveal if they were plagiarized. The problem in academia is that=
 tenures and promotions are awarded based on the number of articles publish=
ed in the Journal of Obscure Studies, and not based on how well you teach.<=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">At Geopolitical Fu=
tures, we hold a meeting of all our analysts around the world at 9 a.m. cen=
tral time, every weekday. At these meetings, the director of analysis organ=
izes the information gathered in the past 24 hours by all the analysts and =
centers the meeting around it. All analysts who submitted intelligence then=
 present and explain why it matters and how it fits or doesn=E2=80=99t fit =
into our model. Then comes the best part where I get involved by challengin=
g their analysis, demanding more detail or giving my own analysis. This mak=
es them frustrated and uncomfortable. It makes me feel good and is essentia=
l for analysis. The whole team gets the same treatment, including me.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">All articles, as t=
hey are written, are distributed to all analysts and critiqued as necessary=
. Then the editors take over, smooth out the rough parts to make them more =
understandable, do a fact check and, as needed, make sure they are grammati=
cally sound, as English is a second language for most of our global analyst=
s. Our team speaks over 20 languages, which helps them avoid missing small =
but important points that a non-native speaker might overlook. Our graphics=
 team creates maps or charts to help visually explain the main points in th=
e analysis. The final step is a copy edit, and then the analysis gets publi=
shed. A long way from automation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">So to answer the r=
eader, anyone simply using AI to write, especially in universities, would r=
apidly be detected by their inability to explain and defend a point. Plagia=
rism in all of its forms is detectable by anyone who can discuss a paper wi=
th the author. But publication of the article for the Journal of Obscure St=
udies might be delayed, along with tenure!</p>

hould be applauded on the grounds of geopolitical fairness. However, there =

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: During t=
he Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union spent vast amounts of m=
oney on nuclear weapons and technology to detect threats and defend against=
 them, as well as retaliate. There was no nuclear war. The creation of subs=
tantial military power decreases, in my mind, the possibility of war. Natio=
ns that start wars are less likely to do so if there is a significant possi=
bility of being defeated. Wars start when a nation believes it runs little =
risk of losing. The great guarantor of peace is balanced and significant mi=
litary power, known to other nations. It is important to be publicly and ho=
nestly able to demonstrate power. Hitler invaded Russia because he saw it a=
s weak. The U.S. and Russia never fought a war because each understood the =
power of the other. If we had understood the power of the North Vietnamese,=
 we would never have gone to war. But the key is to have a clear understand=
ing of what power consists of in different circumstances.</p>

l to be achieved? How can one be so sure Trump will not get played by Putin=
?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: In order=
 to understand war, or anything for that matter, you must understand how it=
 began. The war in Ukraine began with President Vladimir Putin=E2=80=99s fe=
ar of a threat from the West. It continued when Putin failed to achieve his=
 goal of building a buffer. Putin had two reasons to continue the war. One =
was the hope that in the long run, he could occupy Ukraine. The second was =
the knowledge that ending the war without success would be a political cata=
strophe for him inside Russia. The many dead Russians, the severe damage to=
 the economy (which many Russians expected to flourish after the collapse o=
f the Soviet Union), the attempted coup by the Wagner group =E2=80=93 all t=
hese outcomes make a peace agreement for Putin very difficult.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">If we look at how =
and why the war began and at what the Russians expected and what actually h=
appened, we can understand Putin=E2=80=99s unwillingness to make peace in t=
hese circumstances. Peace with only a small part of Ukraine in Russian hand=
s would mean that much was lost for very little. It would also mean that Pu=
tin failed. His actions in these talks strike me as the actions of a desper=
ate man. The end of the war under these circumstances is dangerous for Puti=
n himself. So the end of the war depends on the United States threatening g=
reater damage for Russia =E2=80=93 which, bluff or not, strengthens the han=
d of Russians wanting an end to the conflict. But if we don=E2=80=99t remem=
ber the reason the war began, we will not understand the situation Russia f=
inds itself in now, or why Putin acts as he does.</p>
