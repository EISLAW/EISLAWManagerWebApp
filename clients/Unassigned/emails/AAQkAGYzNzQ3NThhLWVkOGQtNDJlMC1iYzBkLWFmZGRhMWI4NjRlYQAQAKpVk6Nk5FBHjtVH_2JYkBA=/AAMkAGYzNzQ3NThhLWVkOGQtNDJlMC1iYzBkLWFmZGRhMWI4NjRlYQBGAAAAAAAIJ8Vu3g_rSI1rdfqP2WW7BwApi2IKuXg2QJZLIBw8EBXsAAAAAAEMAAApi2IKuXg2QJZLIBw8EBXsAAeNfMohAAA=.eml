It=E2=80=99s been the biggest week for business numbers since the calculato=
r (ok, maybe since Excel).
And no one is paying attention!=20
In the three days we=E2=80=99ve had a massive launch from Claude that drama=
tically improves Excel file performance (Sonnet 4.5 [ https://substack.com/=
redirect/4ba33e1b-13ef-4ad6-acdb-421e2958b8b0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy8=
8YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) plus the launch of a MUCH more po=
werful CoPilot for Excel.=20
Together, these models really are strong enough to speed your Excel work up=
 by 1000x, and for the FIRST time they can actually start to edit your exis=
ting sheets.=20
Which is a huge deal.=20
I=E2=80=99m not kidding about the 1000x. I=E2=80=99ve seen a financial anal=
ysis built in about ~5 minutes that would have taken me 3-4 days previously=
, which is ~1000x longer. I dig into that prompt on the video actually.
So why did I build these prompts? Well when Claude launched Sonnet 4.5, and=
 when CoPilot launched their Excel AI tool, neither the company bothered wi=
th explaining how powerful prompts can be. Claude talked about coding, Saty=
a Nadella talked about test scores.
Who cares. I looked around for Excel AI prompts that could help me build a =
revenue analysis for a client. What I found was useless garbage: =E2=80=9CH=
elp me create a pivot table.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CGenerate a SUMIFS formula.=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CAnalyze this data.=E2=80=9D=20
Maybe not quite that bad, but close.
Not a single prompt addressed what I actually needed: a board-ready revenue=
 model with variance analysis, currency conversions, and scenario toggles. =
So I wrote my own prompt. Three iterations later, I had a complete analysis=
 that would have taken six hours to build manually. Done in just a few minu=
tes.
Then I tried something harder=E2=80=94a custom 6-currency revenue sheet bui=
lt entirely from a screenshot of a client=E2=80=99s existing model. Worked =
perfectly. That=E2=80=99s when I realized the Excel AI landscape just shift=
ed dramatically, but nobody=E2=80=99s writing the prompts that unlock what =
these tools actually do.
So I decided to write about it, and I came up with 18 production prompts fo=
r Excel that are designed to save you hundreds of hours.
Here=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re getting:
Why existing Excel AI prompts dramatically undervalue AI and what changed i=
n the last three weeks that makes this urgent
18 production-ready prompts=20
Four prompt packs with 18 production-ready prompts covering everything from=
 investor-grade financial models to quick operational fixes
These are organized around actual deliverables=E2=80=94board decks, financi=
al models, executive dashboards=E2=80=94not AI features
For the first time, AI can one-shot these, and we should build for that
Also for the first time, a pack of EDIT prompts (I don=E2=80=99t think anyo=
ne has done this yet)
A video breakdown of the prompts so you understand WHY they work
A framework for building your own deliverable prompts in 15 minutes instead=
 of searching for generic garbage
Head-to-head analysis of what just launched from Microsoft and Claude, with=
 benchmarks on what actually works for complex Excel builds
Most people who use Excel (and that=E2=80=99s a lot of us) are barely keepi=
ng up with the AI news, and have no idea how powerful these models are. The=
 1% who get it are losing their sh*t over the leverage. This is the prompt =
library I built for my own consulting work because nothing else exists that=
=E2=80=99s remotely useful for real deliverables.
If you build financial models, board materials, or executive analysis in Ex=
cel, this is probably the most useful thing you=E2=80=99ll read about Excel=
 AI this year.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Quick Start: Build Your Own Deliverable Prompts
You don=E2=80=99t need to wait for someone else to write prompts for your s=
pecific deliverables. Here=E2=80=99s how to build effective Excel AI prompt=
s in about 15 minutes.
Start with the outcome, not the task. Ask yourself: what does the finished =
deliverable look like? Who sees it? What decisions does it support?
Bad starting point: =E2=80=9CI need to analyze revenue data.=E2=80=9D Good =
starting point: =E2=80=9CI need a one-page revenue summary for Monday=E2=80=
=99s exec meeting showing Q3 performance versus plan, with the top three va=
riance drivers highlighted and formatted for a 60-second readout.=E2=80=9D
Use this four-part prompt structure:
Context and Purpose - Who is this for and why does it matter? =E2=80=9CBuil=
d a quarterly revenue analysis for CFO review to identify budget variances =
requiring action.=E2=80=9D
Specific Components - What exactly needs to be in the output? =E2=80=9CIncl=
ude: monthly actuals versus budget by product line, cumulative year-to-date=
 comparison, top 5 variance drivers with explanations, trend analysis showi=
ng 3-month moving average, and conditional formatting highlighting variance=
s >10%.=E2=80=9D
Data Structure - What are you working with? =E2=80=9CSource data: raw trans=
action export with columns for date, product, customer, amount. Expects mon=
thly updates. Needs to handle 10K+ rows.=E2=80=9D
Quality Checks - How do you verify it=E2=80=99s correct? =E2=80=9CValidate:=
 all revenue ties to source data total, no formulas reference external shee=
ts, monthly subtotals equal grand total, conditional formatting applies con=
sistently.=E2=80=9D
Test and iterate. Your first prompt won=E2=80=99t be perfect. Run it, see w=
hat breaks or what=E2=80=99s missing, then add specificity. I typically go =
through 2-3 iterations before a prompt is production-ready.
Document what works. When you nail a prompt, save it with notes on what dat=
a format it expects and what edge cases to watch for. Your future self will=
 thank you when you need to run this again in three months.
The prompts I=E2=80=99m sharing below took me a month to build and test. Bu=
t you can create a custom prompt for your specific deliverable in one after=
noon using this framework. Start with whatever you build most often=E2=80=
=94your weekly dashboard, your monthly board materials, your quarterly mode=
l refresh=E2=80=94and build that prompt first.
Wondering what this all looks like? Dig into the prompt packs below and my =
video for TONS of hands-on examples.

our board for three quarters. The 3-Year Business Plan package gives you ev=

tack: MRR waterfalls, cohort retention, cap table modeling, the works.=20
These aren=E2=80=99t quick dashboards. They=E2=80=99re comprehensive models=
 that would normally take two days to build properly. With these prompts, y=

Each prompt produces a clean, formatted output you can drop straight into b=

This pack solves a different problem=E2=80=94you already have a spreadsheet=
, and it=E2=80=99s broken or ugly or both. Someone sent you a data export t=
hat=E2=80=99s formatted like garbage. Your model has #REF! errors everywher=
e. The dashboard looks like it was built in 2008. These prompts take existi=
ng files and make them usable. Clean up messy exports into categorized summ=
aries.=20
Fix broken formulas across an entire workbook. Transform raw data dumps int=
o board-ready dashboards. Add scenario modeling to static models. The editi=
ng prompts are what I use most often in practice because client files are r=
arely clean. They send me their =E2=80=9Cfinancial model=E2=80=9D and it=E2=
=80=99s actually three broken spreadsheets with circular references and har=
dcoded values. These prompts handle the reality of working with other peopl=
e=E2=80=99s Excel files.
A Note on Model Flavors: CoPilot vs. Claude
So first off: most people don=E2=80=99t have the choice. I recognize that. =
Excel is currently available in Claude Max plans, and coming downmarket to =
other plans soon. CoPilot is conveniently out now wherever Windows exists (=
pretty much) so it=E2=80=99s much easier for most people to get.
That being said, it=E2=80=99s helpful to understand what each model seems t=
o be good at:
CoPilot: Operates within Excel itself, which makes it handy for point edits=
=2E Also able to take prompts and build=
 sheets out and organize data. BUT is=20=
not quite as smart as Claude, and has less solid prompt adherence for long =
hard tasks.
Claude: In my experience unbeaten at prompt adherence across very large, co=
mplex Excel sheets. Treats Excel like an output and is able to use python f=
or complex analysis prior to putting it all into Excel. Not as simple or ea=
sy to do point edits as CoPilot since it operates from outside.
Detail: Microsoft=E2=80=99s Bet on =E2=80=9CVibe Working=E2=80=9D
Microsoft=E2=80=99s new Agent Mode for Excel is their play for what they=E2=
=80=99re calling =E2=80=9Cvibe working=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94using natural langu=
age to steer AI agents through complex spreadsheet tasks. It=E2=80=99s part=
 of their $30/month Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription, and it fundamentall=
y changes how you interact with Excel.
Instead of asking Copilot to =E2=80=9Ccreate a formula,=E2=80=9D you tell A=
gent Mode to =E2=80=9Cbuild a 13-week cash flow model with scenario analysi=
s and variance flagging.=E2=80=9D The AI breaks this down into steps, execu=
tes them, and validates results. Early demos show 80-85% accuracy on formul=
a-heavy edits, with strong performance on orchestration tasks like =E2=80=
=9Cflag outliers in sales data using trend analysis.=E2=80=9D
The new COPILOT function embeds AI directly in cells, auto-updating when da=
ta changes. Python integration means advanced users can leverage full data =
science libraries. For Office workflows, it=E2=80=99s seamless=E2=80=94pull=
 context from Teams, update shared workbooks, collaborate in real-time.
But here=E2=80=99s the thing: Agent Mode launched 48 hours ago. No comprehe=
nsive benchmarks exist yet. Reviews praise usability and multistep automati=
on, but we don=E2=80=99t have hard numbers on complex deliverables. Microso=
ft claims 20-50% time savings on routine tasks. That=E2=80=99s fine for eve=
ryday Excel work. It doesn=E2=80=99t tell us much about building actual str=
ategic deliverables.
Detail: Claude Just Be Shipping
While Microsoft made headlines, Claude has been quietly destroying Excel be=
nchmarks for weeks.
Claude 4.5 (released September 9) hits 72.5% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified=
=E2=80=94a coding benchmark that translates to precision on formulas and VB=
A. It scores 91% on model building tasks and 92% on data cleaning in recent=
 head-to-head tests against 14 AI Excel tools. Users report 50-70% time sav=
ings on executive dashboards.
More importantly, Claude creates actual Excel files. Not suggestions for fo=
rmulas. Not guidance on pivot tables. It generates polished .xlsx files wit=
h formulas, formatting, multiple sheets, and complex logic. Upload raw data=
, describe what you need, and Claude builds it.
I=E2=80=99ve tested this extensively over the past two weeks. The revenue a=
nalysis prompt I mentioned? Claude handled currency conversions, variance c=
alculations, and conditional formatting without me touching Excel once. The=
 6-currency sheet from a screenshot? Claude understood the visual structure=
, inferred the calculation logic, and replicated it perfectly across curren=
cies.
This isn=E2=80=99t theoretical. Finance users who understand what=E2=80=99s=
 possible are reporting transformation-level productivity gains. One commen=
t I saw: =E2=80=9CGame-changing for automation.=E2=80=9D Another: =E2=80=9C=
This is a power tool for experts.=E2=80=9D
The limitation is cost=E2=80=94Claude Pro runs $20-30/month depending on us=
age. But for anyone building complex spreadsheet deliverables regularly, th=
e ROI is immediate.
The Prompt Gap Strikes=E2=80=94Again
This is reminding me of my note yesterday on OpenAI=E2=80=99s terrible prom=
pt packs [ https://substack.com/redirect/7ae64581-09d2-49d7-b914-b2d8fed715=
b2?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
Here=E2=80=99s what bothers me. Both tools are extraordinarily capable. Mic=
rosoft has enterprise distribution and Office integration. Claude has super=
ior benchmarks and file creation. The technology is ready.
But when I search for Excel AI prompts, I find trash. =E2=80=9C10 ChatGPT P=
rompts to Boost Excel Productivity.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CBest Copilot Prompts =
for Excel.=E2=80=9D They=E2=80=99re all variations of the same useless cate=
gories:
Formula helpers: =E2=80=9CCreate a VLOOKUP for...=E2=80=9D
Basic analysis: =E2=80=9CAnalyze this dataset and find trends=E2=80=9D
Generic productivity: =E2=80=9CHelp me clean this data=E2=80=9D
These prompts assume users know what they want to build. They treat AI as a=
 faster way to execute Excel tasks you already understand. That=E2=80=99s n=
ot how people actually work.
When a CFO asks me for a financial model, they don=E2=80=99t say =E2=80=9Cb=
uild me formulas.=E2=80=9D They say =E2=80=9CI need board materials showing=
 revenue attribution by channel with variance explanations.=E2=80=9D When a=
 VP of Sales needs pipeline analysis, they want =E2=80=9Ca forecast with co=
nfidence intervals and deal stage progression, not a tutorial on SUMIFS.=E2=
=80=9D
Real work happens at the deliverable level. Board decks. Client presentatio=
ns. Investment memos. Regulatory reports. Budget reviews. These are outcome=
s, not tasks. And there are zero=E2=80=94literally zero=E2=80=94comprehensi=
ve prompt libraries organized around actual business deliverables.
Why This Matters More Than You Think
Most finance teams have no idea how powerful these models are. They=E2=80=
=99re still thinking about Excel AI as =E2=80=9Ca better formula builder=E2=
=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cfaster data analysis.=E2=80=9D The mental model is wrong=
=2E
But the 1% who get it? They=E2=80=99re losing their shit over how much leve=
rage these tools provide. I=E2=80=99m watching consultants build client del=
iverables in 20 minutes that used to take half a day. Finance teams are gen=
erating board materials in one iteration that used to require three rounds =
of manual updates. Analysts are producing investment committee presentation=
s with scenario modeling that would have taken two people a week.
This isn=E2=80=99t incremental productivity. It=E2=80=99s a structural shif=
t in what=E2=80=99s possible to deliver, and how fast you can deliver it.
The gap exists because prompt libraries are written by people optimizing fo=
r clicks, not by people who actually build financial models or strategy doc=
uments for clients. They=E2=80=99re optimizing for search traffic (=E2=80=
=9DExcel prompts=E2=80=9D), not for outcomes (=E2=80=9Dbuild a DCF model wi=
th sensitivity analysis for a board presentation=E2=80=9D).
What Deliverable-Focused Prompts Actually Look Like
The difference between task prompts and deliverable prompts is context and =
specificity.
A task prompt says: =E2=80=9CCreate a revenue analysis with formulas.=E2=80=
=9D
A deliverable prompt says:=20
=E2=80=9CBuild a revenue attribution analysis for Q3 board presentation sho=
wing channel performance versus targets, with variance explanations for any=
 channel missing target by >10%. Include month-over-month growth rates, yea=
r-over-year comparisons, and a summary table highlighting top 3 overperform=
ing and underperforming channels. Format for executive readability with con=
ditional formatting for variances.=E2=80=9D
The second prompt embeds business context, output format, quality criteria,=
 and audience needs. Claude or Copilot can execute this. But nobody=E2=80=
=99s writing prompts at this level of specificity.
Here=E2=80=99s what a real prompt framework would include:
Industry-specific deliverable templates. Not =E2=80=9Canalyze sales data=E2=
=80=9D but =E2=80=9Cgenerate a SaaS revenue cohort analysis showing monthly=
 recurring revenue by signup cohort, retention curves, and lifetime value p=
rojections for investor updates.=E2=80=9D
Role-based output specifications. CFO board materials look different from o=
perational dashboards. Consulting deliverables have different formatting th=
an internal reports. Prompts should specify audience and context.
Quality validation checkpoints. =E2=80=9CVerify all formulas trace to sourc=
e data. Flag any circular references. Ensure subtotals match grand totals. =
Highlight cells requiring manual review.=E2=80=9D These aren=E2=80=99t add-=
ons=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re essential for deliverables going to executives =
or clients.
Complexity escalation paths. Start with =E2=80=9Cbuild a three-statement fi=
nancial model.=E2=80=9D Then =E2=80=9Cadd scenario analysis with three case=
s.=E2=80=9D Then =E2=80=9Cinclude Monte Carlo simulation for key assumption=
s.=E2=80=9D Each level builds on the previous, giving users a path from bas=
ic to sophisticated.
This isn=E2=80=99t complicated. It=E2=80=99s just specific. And nobody=E2=
=80=99s building it.
The Real Opportunity
The Claude versus Copilot debate misses the point. Both tools are capable e=
nough. Claude leads on complex builds=E2=80=94the benchmarks are clear. Cop=
ilot wins on Office integration and collaborative workflows. For most deliv=
erables, either tool works fine if you know how to prompt it.
The opportunity isn=E2=80=99t explaining which tool is better. It=E2=80=99s=
 building the prompt infrastructure that lets people actually use these too=
ls for real work.
That means prompt libraries organized by deliverable type=E2=80=94board pre=
sentations, client models, regulatory reports, investment memos=E2=80=94not=
 by AI feature. It means templates with embedded quality checks and busines=
s context. It means examples that show what =E2=80=9Cgood=E2=80=9D actually=
 looks like.
Right now, we=E2=80=99re in this bizarre situation where the technology is =
ahead of the implementation knowledge. The models can build sophisticated f=
inancial deliverables in minutes. But users are still searching for =E2=80=
=9Cpivot table prompts=E2=80=9D because that=E2=80=99s all the existing lib=
raries offer.
This gap won=E2=80=99t last long. The 1% who understand what=E2=80=99s poss=
ible are already building internal prompt libraries. Finance teams with str=
ong AI literacy are documenting their workflows. Consultants who get it are=
 creating proprietary templates.
But there=E2=80=99s a window here=E2=80=94probably six months=E2=80=94befor=
e this becomes standard practice. The first comprehensive, deliverable-focu=
sed prompt library for Excel AI will define how people think about using th=
ese tools for real business outputs.
I=E2=80=99m building mine now. Starting with the revenue analysis and finan=
cial modeling prompts I=E2=80=99ve already tested. Then expanding to the co=
nsulting deliverables I build most often for clients=E2=80=94profitability =
models, scenario planning, market sizing, capacity analysis.
If you=E2=80=99re doing similar work, you should probably be doing the same=
=2E The tools are ready. The prompts=
 aren=E2=80=99t. And that gap represents=20=
real competitive advantage for anyone willing to bridge it.

laude launched Sonnet 4.5, and when CoPilot launched their Excel AI tool, n=
either the company bothered with explaining how powerful prompts can be. Cl=
aude talked about coding, Satya Nadella talked about test scores.</p><p sty=

ree iterations later, I had a complete analysis that would have taken six h=
ours to build manually. Done in just a few minutes.</p><p style=3D"margin: =

=E2=80=99t have the choice. I recognize that. Excel is currently available =
in Claude Max plans, and coming downmarket to other plans soon. CoPilot is =
conveniently out now wherever Windows exists (pretty much) so it=E2=80=99s =
much easier for most people to get.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=
: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That being said, it=E2=

rgin: 0;">CoPilot: Operates within Excel itself, which makes it handy for p=
oint edits. Also able to take prompts and build sheets out and organize dat=
a. BUT is not quite as smart as Claude, and has less solid prompt adherence=
 for long hard tasks.</p></li><li style=3D"margin: 8px 0 0 32px;mso-special=

e, complex Excel sheets. Treats Excel like an output and is able to use pyt=
hon for complex analysis prior to putting it all into Excel. Not as simple =
or easy to do point edits as CoPilot since it operates from outside.</p></l=

rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The Claude versus Copilot=
 debate misses the point. Both tools are capable enough. Claude leads on co=
mplex builds=E2=80=94the benchmarks are clear. Copilot wins on Office integ=
ration and collaborative workflows. For most deliverables, either tool work=
s fine if you know how to prompt it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=

p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=

=94board presentations, client models, regulatory reports, investment memos=
=E2=80=94not by AI feature. It means templates with embedded quality checks=
 and business context. It means examples that show what =E2=80=9Cgood=E2=80=

izarre situation where the technology is ahead of the implementation knowle=

But users are still searching for =E2=80=9Cpivot table prompts=E2=80=9D bec=

gap won=E2=80=99t last long. The 1% who understand what=E2=80=99s possible =
are already building internal prompt libraries. Finance teams with strong A=
I literacy are documenting their workflows. Consultants who get it are crea=
ting proprietary templates.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

re=E2=80=94probably six months=E2=80=94before this becomes standard practic=
e. The first comprehensive, deliverable-focused prompt library for Excel AI=
 will define how people think about using these tools for real business out=
