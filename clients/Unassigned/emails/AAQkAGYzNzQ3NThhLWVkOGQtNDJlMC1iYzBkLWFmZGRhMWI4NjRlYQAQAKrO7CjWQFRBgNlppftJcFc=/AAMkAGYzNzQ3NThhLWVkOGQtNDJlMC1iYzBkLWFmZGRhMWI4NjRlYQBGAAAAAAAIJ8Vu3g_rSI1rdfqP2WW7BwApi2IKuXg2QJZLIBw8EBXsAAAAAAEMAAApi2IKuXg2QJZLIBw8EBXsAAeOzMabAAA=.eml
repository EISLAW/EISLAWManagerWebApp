DAILY MEMO: GERMANY'S DEFENSE REFORMS [3]
BERLIN IS INTRODUCING CHANGES TO MAKE ITS MILITARY WAR-READY.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
CHANGES. Germany is overhauling [4] its Defense Ministry structure, concentrating authority over military planning and operations in the hands of the inspector general of the Bundeswehr. The reform is
meant to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency, helping make the German military increasingly war-ready in a time of mounting tensions with Moscow and uncertainty in Washington's commitment to
European defense. The Defense Ministry has also created the new Innovation and Cyber Department to unify a number of projects related to AI, cybersecurity, space defense and IT infrastructure. It’s
also launching the Growth Directorate to address recruitment, training and infrastructure.
HAMAS ON THE U.S. PLAN. The head of Hamas’ military wing in Gaza, Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, has reportedly made clear [5] to mediators that he does not agree with the U.S. plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
He apparently believes the proposal was designed to destroy Hamas and is therefore determined to continue fighting. Some of Hamas’ political leadership based in Qatar are, however, reportedly
willing to accept the plan with some changes. But their influence is limited, since they do not have control of the hostages in Gaza. Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported [6] that the U.S. is
increasing pressure on Hamas to accept the plan and on intermediary countries – Qatar, Egypt and Turkey – to push Hamas in that direction.
FINANCIAL SUPPORT. The United States will send $230 million to Lebanon to support its security apparatus amid the country’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah, Reuters reported [7]. The funding includes
$190 million for the Lebanese armed forces and $40 million for the Internal Security Forces.
PUTIN'S COMMENTS. European leaders are exaggerating the threat posed by Russia and trying to convince their people that Moscow is planning to attack NATO, Russian President Vladimir Putin said [8] in
a speech at the Valdai Discussion Club. He also accused European countries of escalating the Ukraine conflict, as other governments are calling for a resolution and offering to act as mediators. He
said non-military methods – including information warfare and influencing popular opinion – are becoming increasingly important in solving military conflicts. He also reiterated his view that a
multipolar world is evolving with no single power controlling global affairs.
WAR PREPARATION. Russian Ambassador to the Netherlands Vladimir Tarabrin accused [9] the Dutch government of encouraging the Dutch public to prepare for confrontation with Russia within five to seven
years. As evidence of Europe’s preparation for war, Tarabrin cited the Netherlands’ plan to boost its military capabilities and troop numbers by 2030 and the U.K.’s expanding military budget.
ARMS TRADE. A Russian cargo ship suspected of facilitating weapons trade between North Korea and Russia was spotted [10] at North Korea’s Rason port this week for the first time in two months. The
same vessel was seen on satellite images at Russia’s Vostochny port in late September. It has been sanctioned by Western countries for its suspected role in delivering North Korean weapons to
Russia.
OLIVE BRANCH? Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko proposed [11] that his country could work with European nations to restore bilateral relations. He made the comment while congratulating Germany
on its German Unity Day, adding that Belarus has already decided to extend visa-free travel for citizens of EU countries.
MOUNTING TENSIONS. Venezuela said [12] it detected five U.S. F-35 fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast. According to a government statement, the aircraft were spotted 75 kilometers (about 45
miles) from its coastline. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez called the incident a “provocation” that posed a threat to national security.
ECONOMIC TIES. A delegation of French businessmen met [13] in Damascus with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. They discussed prospects for cooperation in energy, aviation, tourism, digital
transformation and resource management. The CEO of MEDEF International led the delegation, while representatives from Airbus, Thales, Bureau Veritas, Accor Hotels and utility company Suez were also
present.
BORDER SECURITY. Officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection have arrived [14] in Armenia for a two-week mission. They will assess the capabilities of Armenia’s border guard and identify areas
for improvement as part of the memorandum of understanding signed between the two countries at the White House in August.
INVESTMENT. China and Brazil have agreed [15] to create a $1 billion fund to invest in energy, infrastructure, mining and other sectors in Brazil. Brazil’s BNDES development bank will contribute
$400 million to the fund, while the Export-Import Bank of China will contribute $600 million.
MENDING TIES. India and China will resume direct flights following a five-year ban, the Indian Foreign Ministry announced [16]. According to the ministry, the move will contribute to a gradual
normalization of bilateral exchanges.
