GERMANY ACTS [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
Germany’s decision to deploy a permanent force of 5,000 soldiers to Lithuania is extremely significant because it signals the next phase of a new geopolitical era. One of the most fundamental
questions of this era is the extent to which the U.S. will limit its military and financial exposure to the global system. Toward that end, Washington has demanded that Europe assume primary
responsibility for its own security and has made initial attempts to reshape the international economic order that had been in place since World War II to facilitate the change. We have been waiting
to see how Europe reacts.
The German deployment is the first response. The size of the deployment is not designed to resist a full Russian attack, of course, but it is meant to trigger a massive response in Europe and instill
a sense of caution in Russia. With Germany having thus created a concrete military commitment in Europe, the question now is whether the deployment is the first of many European actions or simply a
solitary act. As I have argued, Europe is merely the name of the Continent, a landmass slightly larger than the continental U.S. comprising 44 sovereign states. A coordinated European response means
one thing; 44 individual responses would mean quite another. Similarly, it will be important to see not how the entirety of NATO responds but how the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Poland – the
alliance’s strongest and most geographically relevant members – respond. Though it remains unlikely that they would permanently place military forces in positions to block a westward Russian
attack, the Ukraine war has made the prospect possible.
But even if Germany’s was a solitary act, it is a critical shift in Europe. The country has been a pariah state, albeit to a decreasing extent, since World War II – arguably, since World War I. It
initiated combat in both wars, against countries that are now members of NATO, against countries now outside the alliance and, crucially, against the Soviet Union. It emerged from World War II not as
a sovereign nation but as a divided territory, occupied by both the West and the Soviet Union until the 1990s. After it was reunited, it quickly became the Continent’s economic center of gravity.
And though its economic weight makes it the first among equals in the EU, it has been careful to avoid asserting military power. Europe has a long memory, and for centuries, its history was the
history of all-against-all warfare. Germany’s decision to deploy troops in Europe – which has been welcomed by the U.S. as well as other European countries – violates its commitment to modest
ambitions for European leadership. Put simply, the deployment to Lithuania could presage the reemergence of Germany as a geopolitical force. Had the U.K., France or Poland made the military
commitment, we likely wouldn’t bat an eye. But it was Germany that did, so now Europe will have to consider not just what the U.S. wants but also what Germany may become. It’s possible that the
fear of German power is obsolete, but I suspect it isn’t.
[Germany to Russia]
(_click to enlarge [4]_)
There is, meanwhile, the Russian question that must also be considered. The decision to send troops to Lithuania was well thought out strategically. Lithuania borders Latvia, Poland and Belarus; it
has no border with Russia or Ukraine. In the event, say, Russia moves rapidly to occupy Ukraine and then retake the nations that had been part of the Soviet Union, or moves to reclaim influence in the
European satellites it once occupied, a German armored brigade based permanently in Lithuania would raise the stakes. Again, a single German brigade wouldn’t stop the full weight of the Russian
military, but the attack on Lithuania through Belarus would raise the risk of a NATO, and thus U.S., intervention. It’s a prime location to place troops and drive home to Russia the risks
expansionism would carry. At the same time, neither Germany nor Lithuania borders Ukraine, so Moscow can’t see this as a military threat to Ukraine, nor can it threaten Lithuania without first
showing its hand to other countries. This gives NATO, Europe and the United States time to react.
Germany may have also provided a blueprint for European self-defense: Deploying troops into forward positions near but not on the Russian border will show that actions beyond Ukraine will give
European countries a chance to act quickly while still giving NATO options to respond. (As I have said before, it may seem crazy to think that Russia would venture past Ukraine today, but countries
don’t make long-term strategic plans hoping for the best.)
The U.S. decision to recuse itself from European security has created a crisis on the Continent. Fortunately for Europe, U.S. measures to that end have been so far rhetorical; for all its bluster, the
U.S. has not withdrawn troops from NATO, and it has yet to clarify the precise nature of its comments. Still, nations are nations, and they will act in their own interest as such. An alliance like
NATO exists only when nations see the world in the same way. Germany’s deployment could force Europe to decide what to do – and not deciding is a decision. The shock to Europe has generated the
kind of response it wanted. Germany may be likely to be emulated, but given history, it is unlikely to be allowed to lead. The Europeans have long memories.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Germany=E2=80=99s =
decision to deploy a permanent force of 5,000 soldiers to Lithuania is extr=
emely significant because it signals the next phase of a new geopolitical e=
ra. One of the most fundamental questions of this era is the extent to whic=
h the U.S. will limit its military and financial exposure to the global sys=
tem. Toward that end, Washington has demanded that Europe assume primary re=
sponsibility for its own security and has made initial attempts to reshape =
the international economic order that had been in place since World War II =
to facilitate the change. We have been waiting to see how Europe reacts.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The German deploym=
ent is the first response. The size of the deployment is not designed to re=
sist a full Russian attack, of course, but it is meant to trigger a massive=
 response in Europe and instill a sense of caution in Russia. With Germany =
having thus created a concrete military commitment in Europe, the question =
now is whether the deployment is the first of many European actions or simp=
ly a solitary act. As I have argued, Europe is merely the name of the Conti=
nent, a landmass slightly larger than the continental U.S. comprising 44 so=
vereign states. A coordinated European response means one thing; 44 individ=
ual responses would mean quite another. Similarly, it will be important to =
see not how the entirety of NATO responds but how the United Kingdom, Germa=
ny, France and Poland =E2=80=93 the alliance=E2=80=99s strongest and most g=
eographically relevant members =E2=80=93 respond. Though it remains unlikel=
y that they would permanently place military forces in positions to block a=
 westward Russian attack, the Ukraine war has made the prospect possible.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But even if German=
y=E2=80=99s was a solitary act, it is a critical shift in Europe. The count=
ry has been a pariah state, albeit to a decreasing extent, since World War =
II =E2=80=93 arguably, since World War I. It initiated combat in both wars,=
 against countries that are now members of NATO, against countries now outs=
ide the alliance and, crucially, against the Soviet Union. It emerged from =
World War II not as a sovereign nation but as a divided territory, occupied=
 by both the West and the Soviet Union until the 1990s. After it was reunit=
ed, it quickly became the Continent=E2=80=99s economic center of gravity. A=
nd though its economic weight makes it the first among equals in the EU, it=
 has been careful to avoid asserting military power. Europe has a long memo=
ry, and for centuries, its history was the history of all-against-all warfa=
re. Germany=E2=80=99s decision to deploy troops in Europe =E2=80=93 which h=
as been welcomed by the U.S. as well as other European countries =E2=80=93 =
violates its commitment to modest ambitions for European leadership. Put si=
mply, the deployment to Lithuania could presage the reemergence of Germany =
as a geopolitical force. Had the U.K., France or Poland made the military c=
ommitment, we likely wouldn=E2=80=99t bat an eye. But it was Germany that d=
id, so now Europe will have to consider not just what the U.S. wants but al=
so what Germany may become. It=E2=80=99s possible that the fear of German p=
ower is obsolete, but I suspect it isn=E2=80=99t.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There is, meanwhil=
e, the Russian question that must also be considered. The decision to send =
troops to Lithuania was well thought out strategically. Lithuania borders L=
atvia, Poland and Belarus; it has no border with Russia or Ukraine. In the =
event, say, Russia moves rapidly to occupy Ukraine and then retake the nati=
ons that had been part of the Soviet Union, or moves to reclaim influence i=
n the European satellites it once occupied, a German armored brigade based =
permanently in Lithuania would raise the stakes. Again, a single German bri=
gade wouldn=E2=80=99t stop the full weight of the Russian military, but the=
 attack on Lithuania through Belarus would raise the risk of a NATO, and th=
us U.S., intervention. It=E2=80=99s a prime location to place troops and dr=
ive home to Russia the risks expansionism would carry. At the same time, ne=
ither Germany nor Lithuania borders Ukraine, so Moscow can=E2=80=99t see th=
is as a military threat to Ukraine, nor can it threaten Lithuania without f=
irst showing its hand to other countries. This gives NATO, Europe and the U=
nited States time to react.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Germany may have a=
lso provided a blueprint for European self-defense: Deploying troops into f=
orward positions near but not on the Russian border will show that actions =
beyond Ukraine will give European countries a chance to act quickly while s=
till giving NATO options to respond. (As I have said before, it may seem cr=
azy to think that Russia would venture past Ukraine today, but countries do=
n=E2=80=99t make long-term strategic plans hoping for the best.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. decision =
to recuse itself from European security has created a crisis on the Contine=
nt. Fortunately for Europe, U.S. measures to that end have been so far rhet=
orical; for all its bluster, the U.S. has not withdrawn troops from NATO, a=
nd it has yet to clarify the precise nature of its comments. Still, nations=
 are nations, and they will act in their own interest as such. An alliance =
like NATO exists only when nations see the world in the same way. Germany=
=E2=80=99s deployment could force Europe to decide what to do =E2=80=93 and=
 not deciding is a decision. The shock to Europe has generated the kind of =
response it wanted. Germany may be likely to be emulated, but given history=
, it is unlikely to be allowed to lead. The Europeans have long memories.</=
