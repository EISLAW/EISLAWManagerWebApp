The discipline of talking out loud is very underrated. We say do it for int=
erviews to practice. Do it for powerpoint presentations you don=E2=80=99t w=
ant to mess up. That=E2=80=99s all true. (It=E2=80=99s still hard to make y=
ourself do it.)
But it turns out it=E2=80=99s good for learning too (shocker I know). I=E2=
=80=99m beginning to think we need to start to practice talking aloud throu=
gh any material in order to really internalize anything we deeply want to l=
earn.=20
I had digested this deck for my piece on Meeker from earlier this week [ ht=
tps://substack.com/redirect/d55645f7-4103-4232-97de-8c0961bc3d0c?j=3DeyJ1Ij=
oiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
But it was different going through slide by slide and forcing myself to tal=
k out loud to camera about what I saw. I saw stuff Mary didn=E2=80=99t talk=
 about. I got insights around the roots of the AI revolution, how we are ac=
tually getting such rapid adoption that I hadn=E2=80=99t fully grasped befo=
re.
And I put them all down here. You can grab them in the video or get them in=
 digested and crystallized form below as well. Just as a teaser trailer: di=
d you know how important the chipset Volta was in catalyzing the AI revolut=
ion? Do you know what breakthroughs are missing for AGI? I get into both of=
 those a bit below. It sounds geeky, but this stuff explains a ton about ou=
r current world, so I thought it was worth the deep dive.
Enjoy!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Ok we=E2=80=99re gonna get right to it. What are the top seven takeaways fr=
om digging through the first 142 pages of Mary=E2=80=99s deck [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/d8bc19de-bb81-4bdc-911e-9f5aaaba46aa?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] and forcing myself to ta=
lk about everything I=E2=80=99m learning and seeing out loud?
1. 2019 Was the Hidden Inflection Point=E2=80=94When Machine Learning Quiet=
ly Became AI
Most people point to ChatGPT as the beginning of the AI boom. Especially af=
ter staring at this deck, I don=E2=80=99t buy that. I think the real turnin=
g point happened in 2019=E2=80=94and almost nobody talks about it.
Here=E2=80=99s what I saw: AI startup funding jumped from $18B in 2017 to $=
26B in 2019. That=E2=80=99s not just a money story=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a m=
indset shift. Around the same time, OpenAI pulled off something wild: they =
trained a robot hand, Dactyl, entirely in simulation and it managed to solv=
e a Rubik=E2=80=99s Cube in the real world. That was a leap in transfer lea=
rning. Meanwhile, DeepMind was reinventing reinforcement learning with Temp=
oral Value Transport, a method for passing lessons from the future back to =
earlier decision points.
At the same time, big companies figured out that AI was going to be a thing=
=2E And Mary captures this in her deck. Look at 2019!
You get the idea.
This was also when Nvidia=E2=80=99s Volta architecture started showing what=
 was possible. With over 125 TFLOPs per chip and a 5x improvement over Pasc=
al, suddenly experiments that used to take weeks could be run over a weeken=
d. The hardware showed up. The breakthroughs started stacking. And capital =
followed.
So when people say =E2=80=9CChatGPT changed everything=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94I g=
et it. But in my view, the real AI arms race began in 2019. By the time Cha=
tGPT hit, it was the consumer explosion built on years of building the AI r=
ails.=20
And I think I hadn=E2=80=99t realized quite how key that infrastructure was=
 until I stared at it in this deck and talked out loud for 40 minutes=E2=80=
=94and I worked at Amazon in 2019 for crying out loud. Sometimes you=E2=80=
=99re too close to the forest to really see the trees lol.
2. Volta Was the Real Catalyst=E2=80=94Not the Transformer Paper
When I look at the history of this field, one chip stands out more than any=
 paper: Nvidia=E2=80=99s Volta GPU. Yes even that paper [ https://substack.=
com/redirect/47e6245e-9a17-464e-b7ca-2312b559f90e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.z=
dzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
Volta didn=E2=80=99t just deliver 125 TFLOPs of performance=E2=80=94it chan=
ged the unit economics of AI. It fused CUDA and Tensor Cores to crank out 1=
2x the throughput of the prior generation. That was a structural leap, not =
a marginal gain.
Our world would not be possible without the Volta breakthough.
To put it in concrete terms: training the image recognition model ResNet-50=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/71519c2a-b16f-495c-8438-830ba6b6922a?j=3De=
yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] used to co=
st ~$1,000. By 2019, it cost $10. That 100x drop flipped the economic table=
=2E Suddenly, every startup and researc=
h lab could afford to run serious expe=
riments. One V100 could train ResNet-50 at 1,075 images/sec=E2=80=944x fast=
er than Pascal.
Papers like Attention is All You Need [ https://substack.com/redirect/47e62=
45e-9a17-464e-b7ca-2312b559f90e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] were critical to lay the theoretical groundwork =
for the AI revolution we=E2=80=99re living through. But none of it would ha=
ve actually happened if we hadn=E2=80=99t had technical breakthroughs at th=
e silicon level like Volta.
People focus on software breakthroughs, but I=E2=80=99ll say it flat-out: I=
 think Volta mattered more to get to the world we live in today, and I hadn=
=E2=80=99t realized that so profoundly until I walked this deck out loud.=
=20
Without the Volta cost collapse, the transformer revolution wouldn=E2=80=99=
t have had the fuel. I think we underestimate just how much progress since =
2018 rode on the back of this one architecture. We had the steam engine for=
 a long time before trains.=20
Technological leaps require multiple converging breakthroughs, and it=E2=80=
=99s good to have a tiny bit of perspective on what made these massive brea=
kthroughs possible in the last half decade.
3. AI is Proliferating, not Centralizing
Mary frames this as a =E2=80=9Cglobal AI leadership race.=E2=80=9D I see it=
 differently and I see echoes of a different take in her own deck too as I =
walk it.=20
I think we=E2=80=99re watching a full-scale proliferation. Walking the deck=
 reinforced how differently we=E2=80=99re thinking, and I think this feels =
like a disagreement between operators (who see multiple models on leaderboa=
rds daily) and policymakers comfortable in DC, who frame things in national=
 security terms a lot.
How can you secure a model when sys prompts leak within 48 hours verbatim? =
When no one has a good answer to the problem of just asking an LLM nicely f=
or its system prompt? These are different technologies, and Cold War assump=
tions about application hardening aren=E2=80=99t valid here.
Since 2019, countries around the world=E2=80=94through Nvidia=E2=80=99s AI =
Nations initiative and beyond=E2=80=94have been building sovereign AI infra=
structure. Not to beat Silicon Valley. Just to not be dependent on it. And =
they=E2=80=99ve put serious capital behind it. Nvidia projects tens of bill=
ions in revenue from governments going forward.
Everywhere I look, I see this pattern: Denmark funding supercomputers with =
Ozempic profits. Southeast Asia building models to represent regional diale=
cts. The African Union calling out the risk of importing AI that ignores th=
eir values. This isn=E2=80=99t a leadership race. It=E2=80=99s a diversific=
ation wave.
Mary notes in the deck that we see 27,000+ AI startups globally. That=E2=80=
=99s probably low. And walking the deck out loud showed me that there=E2=80=
=99s a disconnect between claiming a vibrant global ecosystem of AI startup=
s and also claiming in the same breath that it it=E2=80=99s possible to win=
 an AI dominance race.=20
Do best practices matter globally? Absolutely. I do not put my data on clou=
d-hosted DeepSeek for a reason. Their Terms of Service are really worrying.=
 But there=E2=80=99s a difference between pushing for excellence and framin=
g AI growth reductively in terms of just China vs. US.=20
I don=E2=80=99t think we=E2=80=99re headed toward one dominant AI anymore. =
We already live in a world of hundreds of capable systems=E2=80=94each shap=
ed by different priorities, languages, and power structures. That=E2=80=99s=
 not a race. That=E2=80=99s a pluralist ecosystem.
Something Mary herself notes in the deck.
4. We=E2=80=99re Living Through a Cost vs. Usage Paradox
Here=E2=80=99s one thing I think Mary glossed over as I talked it out loud,=
 and I didn=E2=80=99t see it quite so clearly until this second time throug=
h: the economics of AI right now are unstable. I am calling this the Two-Tr=
ack Problem.
Track 1: Costs Collapse. GPT-4-level compute has gotten 240x cheaper in the=
 last 18 months=E2=80=94dropping from $180 per million tokens to less than =
$1. Image classification? Down multiple orders of magnitude as well. Everyt=
hing in AI has a log scale lol.
Track 2: Usage Explodes. OpenAI was rumored to spend ~$4B partial year for =
2024 just running inference on Microsoft=E2=80=99s infrastructure. That mig=
ht be something like ~290,000 servers at near full load. And inference isn=
=E2=80=99t a one-time cost=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s forever. Every chatbot ping=
, every user prompt, every API call adds up.
The training gets all the press, but inference is the real economic weight.=
 It accounts for 80=E2=80=9390% of lifetime cost in many orgs. Meanwhile, t=
he amortized cost of training these huge models keeps going up=E2=80=942.4x=
 per year since 2016.
So we=E2=80=99re stuck in a paradox: costs per token are falling, usage is =
soaring, but margins are razor thin. That=E2=80=99s why, despite 800 millio=
n users, OpenAI reportedly lost $5B in 2024. That math doesn=E2=80=99t work=
 unless something changes.
And saying it out loud as I walked through Mary=E2=80=99s deck makes me wan=
t to do a deep dive on that piece alone. Because that is a massive problem =
for the industry. And I do not think an all-or-nothing bet on AGI is a rati=
onal approach to fixing it.
5. AGI Is Missing More Than One Piece
Let me be blunt. After staring at this deck a fair bit, I have higher convi=
ction that the path from where we are to AGI isn=E2=80=99t just scale of pr=
etraining data. It=E2=80=99s not just better. I expect both to keep getting=
 better for a bit. But that is now the the easiest stuff we=E2=80=99ve alre=
ady done.
The big leaps Mary outlines correctly=E2=80=94in particular pretraining, in=
ference, and GPU unit economics=E2=80=94got us to this plateau. But the nex=
t frontier? It=E2=80=99s even harder.
I found myself looking for these in Mary=E2=80=99s deck, and I didn=E2=80=
=99t see them. And now I think I want to write a piece on AGI and what=E2=
=80=99s in the way.
Continuous learning still isn=E2=80=99t real. Our models don=E2=80=99t impr=
ove over time in a persistent way. They don=E2=80=99t retain internal state=
 between tasks. No matter how many conversations you have with an LLM, it f=
orgets. That=E2=80=99s a brick wall.
Memory and context remain shallow. Even with long-context models, we=E2=80=
=99re still dealing with very short-term memory. There=E2=80=99s no concept=
 of true longterm memory. There=E2=80=99s also no ability to wide-screen co=
ntext and bring all that fuzzy context to a problem as the context itself e=
volves. Humans do that.
Real-world adaptability? These models aren=E2=80=99t evolving and adapting =
in the wild, and right now it=E2=80=99s not clear anybody wants them to if =
we could build them that way. There are alignment problems there.=20
I am fully aware that there are Nobel prize winners (looking at you Demis) =
on the other side of this bet. These may indeed be solvable in the next 3-5=
 years. If money can solve it, we will solve it. But I think the question I=
 have is: what if all the money gives us really really IQ smart tools power=
ed by inference and pretrain without enough of these three core qualities t=
o be true AGI? What then? Meeker=E2=80=99s deck doesn=E2=80=99t really lay =
out the counterfactuals here, and I realized how much I missed that walking=
 the deck again.
6. AI Didn=E2=80=99t Build Its Own Rails=E2=80=94It Rode the Mobile Wave
Most people think AI needed new infrastructure to grow. I see it differentl=
y: it piggybacked on what mobile already built. And that popped for me as I=
 went through some of the explosive adoption slides in this deck.
You wanna know how those numbers are popping like that? They build on decad=
es of investment in mobile internet across the globe.=20
Global internet penetration is now 66%. Nearly everyone goes online via mob=
ile=E2=80=9495.9% of users. In many regions, mobile is the internet. And th=
at=E2=80=99s what made ChatGPT=E2=80=99s explosive growth possible.
Take India: In 2016, Jio offered 4GB of free data per day. Internet subscri=
ptions exploded 58% in a year. Fast forward, and 20% of the global internet=
 user base is Indian=E2=80=94despite low PC usage. Why? Phones. And that sh=
ows up in ChatGPT usage numbers! You know who the #2 country is for ChatGPT=
 after the US? India!
Anyway, by 2023, 5G was everywhere. 1.5 billion global subscriptions, deliv=
ering fast, low-latency connectivity. That=E2=80=99s what ChatGPT tapped in=
to. It wasn=E2=80=99t just a good chatbot. It was a text-based, mobile-firs=
t service. It ran on the infrastructure already in everyone=E2=80=99s pocke=
t.
This is one of the biggest reasons AI scaled fast. It didn=E2=80=99t wait f=
or new networks. It rode the one we=E2=80=99d already built. I hadn=E2=80=
=99t realized that clearly until I forced myself to walk out loud through t=
he full global story in the Meeker deck.
7. Enterprises Talk Revenue, But Act on Cost
There=E2=80=99s a huge mismatch between what companies say about AI and wha=
t they actually do.
Publicly, it=E2=80=99s all about new revenue. But in the trenches, it=E2=80=
=99s automation, efficiency, and cost-cutting.
45% of leaders say AI helps with cost transformation. 9 out of 10 service w=
orkers using generative AI say it helps them serve customers faster. That=
=E2=80=99s efficiency.
Support chatbots? 31% adoption. Dev and IT ops? Top use cases. This is wher=
e the real traction is. The creative, revenue-generating stuff=E2=80=94like=
 sales and marketing=E2=80=94has been easy to launch a startup about, but h=
ard to prove value for.=20
Look I=E2=80=99m not saying we don=E2=80=99t have a loads of sales AI solut=
ions. It=E2=80=99s enough for clickbait now! Ditto marketing.
But measuring top line impact is tougher without clear cost-cutting goals. =
And I notice even in sales and marketing tools, the AI tools that are launc=
hed usually attack cost centers because the measurability is easier.
Why? Because messy data and fuzzy objectives on the top line make that terr=
ain much harder. Humans have always been not so good at explaining how comp=
lex and fuzzy logic shapes something as critical as making money. And that =
human ambiguity is not something AI is great at. AI does better in places w=
here the rewards are clear, and a lot of the challenge with marketing and s=
ales is that rewards are interrelated and ambiguous, and these rewards ofte=
n take months to appear with unclear causal relationships. This makes it ha=
rd for humans, let alone AI!
This is probably why 75% of mid-size businesses say AI might boost revenue=
=E2=80=94but as I=E2=80=99ve reported elsewhere most enterprise AI projects=
 fail to produce ROI. If wishes were fishes.=20
Walking the deck out loud made me realize that I want to dig much more deep=
ly into the disconnect between what businesses say they want to do (make mo=
ney with AI) and what they choose to focus on (cut costs).
Absolutely=E2=80=94here=E2=80=99s a sharp, reflective conclusion that cente=
rs the process of talking it out loud as the real unlock:
Final Thought: Talking It Out Was the Real Breakthrough
I didn=E2=80=99t expect this. I thought I was just going to walk through Ma=
ry Meeker=E2=80=99s deck, call out a few big trends, and maybe synthesize s=
ome insights for the newsletter.
But forcing myself to talk it all out loud=E2=80=94every chart, every stat,=
 every implied assumption=E2=80=94completely changed what I saw.
This wasn=E2=80=99t just a summary. It became a lens. The act of explaining=
 forced me to confront where my intuitions were fuzzy, where my mental mode=
ls needed updating, and where the industry narrative felt incomplete. I sta=
rted seeing second-order effects, unstated tradeoffs, missing counterfactua=
ls. It gave me clarity.
I realized that Volta might matter more than transformers. That proliferati=
on, not dominance, is the real shape of AI in 2025. That cost and usage are=
 locked in a tension no one knows how to resolve. That AGI isn=E2=80=99t ju=
st a question of scale=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a question of missing architect=
ure. That mobile infrastructure=E2=80=94not new chips=E2=80=94was the quiet=
 hero of AI distribution. And that most enterprises still talk a revenue ga=
me while betting on cost reduction.
None of that came from just reading slides.
It came from doing the work of saying it out loud. I learned more by walkin=
g through this deck in real time than I have from months of industry analys=
is.
So if there=E2=80=99s a meta-lesson here, it=E2=80=99s this: when the story=
 feels too smooth, too pre-packaged, say it out loud. See what breaks. What=
 sharpens. What surprises you.
That=E2=80=99s how insight actually happens.

 beginning of the AI boom. Especially after staring at this deck, I don=E2=

 AI startup funding jumped from $18B in 2017 to $26B in 2019. That=E2=80=99=
s not just a money story=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a mindset shift. Around the s=

yl, entirely in simulation and it managed to solve a Rubik=E2=80=99s Cube i=
n the real world. That was a leap in transfer learning. Meanwhile, DeepMind=
 was reinventing reinforcement learning with Temporal Value Transport, a me=
thod for passing lessons from the future back to earlier decision points.</=

color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The training gets =
all the press, but inference is the real economic weight. It accounts for 8=
0=E2=80=9390% of lifetime cost in many orgs. Meanwhile, the amortized cost =

hout clear cost-cutting goals. And I notice even in sales and marketing too=
ls, the AI tools that are launched usually attack cost centers because the =
measurability is easier.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=
,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Why? Because messy data and fuzzy =
objectives on the top line make that terrain much harder. Humans have alway=
s been not so good at explaining how complex and fuzzy logic shapes somethi=
ng as critical as making money. And that human ambiguity is not something A=
I is great at. AI does better in places where the rewards are clear, and a =
lot of the challenge with marketing and sales is that rewards are interrela=
ted and ambiguous, and these rewards often take months to appear with uncle=
ar causal relationships. This makes it hard for humans, let alone AI!</p><p=

 for the newsletter.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=

letely changed what I saw.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This wasn=E2=80=99t just a summa=
ry. It became a lens. The act of explaining forced me to confront where my =
intuitions were fuzzy, where my mental models needed updating, and where th=
e industry narrative felt incomplete. I started seeing second-order effects=
, unstated tradeoffs, missing counterfactuals. It gave me clarity.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">I realized that Volta might matter more than transformers. That pro=
liferation, not dominance, is the real shape of AI in 2025. That cost and u=
sage are locked in a tension no one knows how to resolve. That AGI isn=E2=
=80=99t just a question of scale=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a question of missing=
 architecture. That mobile infrastructure=E2=80=94not new chips=E2=80=94was=
 the quiet hero of AI distribution. And that most enterprises still talk a =
revenue game while betting on cost reduction.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

came from just reading slides.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It came from doing the work =
of saying it out loud. I learned more by walking through this deck in real =
