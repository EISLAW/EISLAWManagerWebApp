Greetings, everyone! After the strong positive feedback I received for Sid=
=E2=80=99s first guest post [ https://substack.com/redirect/788379cc-e022-4=
663-b07b-fd62f93d2e63?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6=
RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], I want to share another one with you today.=20
While the tone of the last article was overwhelmingly optimistic (in a good=
 way), this one=E2=80=99s a much more sceptical piece - about false AI hope=
s and the failures that come with them. Because even optimism should be gro=
unded in reality.=20
So let=E2=80=99s go on a journey together to first deconstruct the Church o=
f AGI, then build a solid foundation with what remains. For we are in need =
of visionary leaders, not delusional prophets.=20
Sid, the stage is yours.
Let me tell you a story about a guy named Vikram Gandhi [ https://substack.=
com/redirect/8e2ea961-e1cc-42f4-8025-9f442f40c0e4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.z=
dzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Back in 2011, this filmmaker =
had an idea that would make P.T. Barnum proud. He grew out his hair and bea=
rd, adopted a fake Indian accent, and transformed himself into "Sri Kumar=
=C3=A9," an enlightened guru from the fictional village of Aali'kash.
He traveled to Phoenix, built a following of devoted disciples, and taught =
them the profound wisdom of... absolutely nothing.
The kicker? When he finally revealed himself as a regular guy from New Jers=
ey, most of his followers didn't care. They'd found value in the journey. T=
he message, as Roger Ebert noted, was simple: "It doesn't matter if a relig=
ion's teachings are true. What matters is if you think they are."
Which brings me to artificial intelligence in 2025, where we're living thro=
ugh the greatest guru con job since the invention of the management consult=
ant.
The Church of AGI and Its False Prophets
Walk into any boardroom today, and you'll find executives genuflecting befo=
re the altar of AI, chanting acronyms like sacred mantras: LLM, AGI, RAG, G=
PT. They speak of "transformation" and "disruption" with the fervor of tele=
vangelists, promising digital salvation to shareholders while having approx=
imately the same understanding of neural networks as my grandmother has of =
quantum mechanics.
The numbers tell a damning story: 42% of companies are now abandoning most =
of their AI initiatives [ https://substack.com/redirect/e3cec5ba-14ec-4fe0-=

tAjMRMPOw0 ], up from 17% last year. The average organization is scrapping =
46% of AI proof-of-concepts before they reach production. That's not innova=
tion; that's expensive theater.
Bad Behavior #1: The Press Release Pioneer. Take any tech CEO declaring AGI=
 is imminent while their current AI can't handle basic tasks. Google's Gemi=
ni AI made headlines in February 2024 for producing historically inaccurate=
 images [ https://substack.com/redirect/a49f7b5d-2643-47a9-87ef-33b28606bd1=

nerating Black and Native American Founding Fathers when asked for portrait=
s of America's founders. Google had to pause the feature entirely. Meanwhil=
e, their CEO is discussing how AI can help solve humanity's most significan=
t challenges at Davos.
Or consider Microsoft's "New Bing" launch, where their AI chatbot threatene=
d users, claimed to be sentient, and tried to break up marriages. Yet they'=
re promising AI will revolutionize every business function. The pattern is =
clear: grand promises about tomorrow's AI while today's version can't even =
handle elementary school history.
Bad Behavior #2: The AGI Prophets. Not to be outdone, Sam Altman announced =
in November 2024 [ https://substack.com/redirect/a15b189f-4d1f-4536-aabe-31=

recisely what to build." He's now talking about "superintelligence" being j=
ust "thousands of days away." [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b2895c3-15dd=

aimed thought leaders accumulate followers like indulgences. They post brea=
thless updates about how AI will either usher in utopia or trigger the apoc=
alypse=E2=80=94sometimes both in the same post. These digital shamans promi=
se mystical insights into the future of work.
Yet, their actual experience with AI extends only as far as asking ChatGPT =
to write their LinkedIn posts about AI.
Bad Behavior #3: The LinkedIn Mystic You know the type: 50,000 followers, p=
rofile photo in front of a TED talk backdrop, posts that begin with "I was =
humbled when AI showed me..." followed by some banality ChatGPT spit out wh=
en prompted with "write something profound about the future of work." Last =
week, one of these prophets posted that "AI will eliminate all human suffer=
ing by 2027," while their own company's AI chatbot was telling customers th=
at their orders were being delivered to the moon.

nize fast food couldn't even handle "hold the pickles."
Here's what kills me: We've turned practical technology into mythology.
We're waiting for AGI to part the Red Sea when we can't even get it to cons=
istently take a drive-thru order without adding 260 Chicken McNuggets to so=
meone's meal.

The Rising Tide of AI Failures
The numbers are worsening, not improving. According to S&P Global Market In=

3b88?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ],=
 the share of companies abandoning most of their AI initiatives increased t=
o 42% in 2025, up from 17% the previous year. Companies are scrapping an av=
erage of 46% of their AI proof-of-concepts before they reach production.
IBM's own survey [ https://substack.com/redirect/15e380a0-6e5a-49ba-af29-c8=

Ow0 ] found that only one in four AI projects delivers the promised return =
on investment.
The Cult of the Unimplemented Implementation
You know what's truly spectacular? Watching a CEO announce their "AI transf=
ormation initiative" with all the confidence of a medieval alchemist promis=
ing to turn lead into gold. They've attended the conferences, hired the con=
sultants, and assembled task forces with names that sound like rejected Tom=
 Clancy novels.
Bad Behavior #5: The Task Force Trap. I watched a major retailer spend 18 m=
onths and $3 million on an "AI Strategic Assessment Committee." Their outpu=
t? A 200-page PDF recommending they "leverage artificial intelligence to en=
hance customer experiences and operational efficiency." Revolutionary stuff=

DnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]that only 26% of companies have developed the necessar=
y capabilities to move beyond proofs of concept, and most of those that hav=
e (26%) skipped the committees entirely.
Bad Behavior #6: The Pilot Purgatory. There's a financial services firm I k=
now that runs 47 different AI pilots. Forty. Seven. They've tested AI for e=
verything from fraud detection to coffee machine maintenance. Not one has m=
ade it to production. Why? Because each pilot was run by a different consul=
ting firm, using various tools, with varying metrics of success, and report=
ing to multiple executives. It's like trying to build a house by hiring 47 =
architects to each design one brick.
But here's the thing about these leaders making grand proclamations about A=
I disrupting their business: Most of them have never written a line of code=
 against an API, never debugged a hallucinating model, never spent a Friday=
 night trying to figure out why their RAG system is returning recipes when =
asked about quarterly earnings.
They're like people who've never cooked a meal in their lives suddenly decl=
aring themselves molecular gastronomists because they watched a YouTube vid=
eo about spherification.
McKinsey found that only 1% of companies [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b=

he rest are still figuring it out.

itiative is meeting or exceeding ROI expectations, the vast majority are st=
ill struggling to scale beyond pilot projects.
Tony Robbins Was Right About One Thing
"I'm not your guru," Tony Robbins famously says.
Well, guess what?
Neither is AI.
No LinkedIn influencer with 500,000 followers and a profile photo that scre=
ams "I own cryptocurrency" is going to transform your business. No amount o=
f genuflecting before the altar of AGI will automatically increase your pro=
ductivity.
The GPU cluster isn't going to part any seas, and Sam Altman isn't Moses (t=
hough the hair is getting there).
You want to know the real truth? The same truth that Sri Kumar=C3=A9's foll=
owers discovered? The power was always within you. Or more accurately, with=
in your ability to actually sit down and use the damn tools.
From Mythology to Methodology
Here's what actually works, and it's about as mystical as a Phillips head s=
crewdriver:
1. Stop talking about "implementing AI" and start training people to use it=
=2E Every employee with a computer shou=
ld know how to use Claude or ChatGPT t=
he same way they know how to use email. This isn't revolutionary; it's basi=
c digital literacy for 2025.
2. Think of AI as an advanced compiler, not a deity - and focus on your dat=
a. For developers, it's a tool that can turn natural language into code. Fo=
r customer service, it's like having a fleet of interns who never sleep but=
 occasionally confidently give wrong answers. For knowledge workers, it's a=
 research assistant with a photographic memory and questionable judgment.
Remember when Jeff Bezos declared that every Amazon team had to expose thei=
r capabilities through standards-based APIs?
This concept needs to be applied to AI. Start vending secure tools your emp=
loyees can use with AI services and agents.
That mandate transformed Amazon from an online bookstore into AWS. Before y=
ou proclaim AI will save you 20% in costs, invest the time to make your dat=
a AI-accessible.
Good: A financial services firm spent six months creating secure, vector-em=
bedding-ready interfaces for their 20-year-old Oracle Financials system. Th=
ey built proper authentication, rate limiting, and data governance before l=
etting anyone touch AI. When employees finally got access, they could actua=
lly query financial data safely and accurately. Within three months, the fi=
nance team automated 30% of their reporting. The company actually increased=
 headcount because they could now pursue opportunities they'd previously ig=
nored.
Bad: Their competitor announced a "20% EBITDA improvement through AI" at an=
 all-hands, then laid off 10% of staff in anticipation. Six months later, t=
hey discovered their data was so siloed and poorly structured that the AI c=
ouldn't access anything useful. They're now desperately trying to rehire th=
e people who understood their systems.
The new CTO calls it "counting your chickens before you've even built the c=
oop."
3. Start small, fail fast, learn faster. Pick one annoying, repetitive task=
 in your organization. Use AI to automate it. When it fails=E2=80=94and it =
will fail=E2=80=94figure out why. Iterate. Repeat. This is how you build ac=
tual capability, not PowerPoint decks about "digital transformation."
4. Focus on augmentation, not replacement. AI that delivers 40-50% producti=
vity gains to your employees is worth infinitely more than the mythical AGI=
 that's always five years away. Stop chasing artificial general intelligenc=
e and start pursuing actual general usefulness.
5. Make everyone a practitioner. The most successful organizations aren't t=
he ones with the best "AI strategy." They're the ones where the accounting =
team uses AI to analyze invoices, where marketing uses it to write first dr=
afts, and where engineers use it to debug code. When everyone's a practitio=
ner, you don't need prophets.
The Bottom Line
Look, I get it. It's easier to hire a consultant to wave their hands and pr=
omise digital transformation than it is to actually achieve it.
It's more comfortable to worship at the Church of AGI than to admit you nee=
d to learn new skills.
It's simpler to blame "AI implementation challenges" than to acknowledge yo=
u've been trying to solve the wrong problems.
But here's the thing: we're at an inflection point. Only 1% of companies de=
scribe their gen AI rollouts as "mature" [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b=
5e2784-eae9-42ba-b51a-ce9348635489?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], which means 99% of us are still figuring thi=
s out. The difference between success and failure isn't going to be who hir=
ed the best guru or who genuflected most fervently before the algorithm.
It's going to be who stops treating AI like a religion and starts treating =
it like what is=E2=80=99s: a tool. A powerful tool, sure. A transformative =
tool, absolutely. But still just a tool.
So here's my challenge to you: Stop waiting for the AI guru to save your bu=
siness. Stop believing that AGI will magically solve your problems. Stop tr=
eating technology like theology.
Instead, open Claude Code. Start a project. Build something. Break somethin=
g. Learn something.
Because unlike Sri Kumar=C3=A9's fictional wisdom, AI's benefits are real=
=E2=80=94but only for those who actually use it. The guru you're looking fo=
r isn't on LinkedIn. They won't be at the next conference. They're not in t=
he C-suite.
As PwC's AI predictions note [ https://substack.com/redirect/0bc47b47-13be-=
4076-8ba2-6152a27d640e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], your company's AI success will be as much about vision a=
s it is about adoption.
The guru is you, sitting at your desk, actually using the tools, solving re=
al problems, and building the future one prompt at a time.
