I think we all need to know this, so I=E2=80=99m pulling it from behind the=
 paywall and I=E2=80=99m sending it right now instead of waiting until Mond=
ay.=20
It=E2=80=99s absolutely horrifying. And no, I=E2=80=99m not going to commen=
t on the merits of the case itself. My focus here is exclusively on the cho=
ice that the NYT made to ask for Judge Wang to archive every single piece o=
f text the vast majority of users has entered into ChatGPT, including so-ca=
lled temporary chats and chats deleted by these same users, all in order to=
 make that very personal data eligible for data discovery in a public case.
This is overreach.
Judge Wang=E2=80=99s discovery order in the NYT case compels OpenAI to stoc=
kpile every consumer chat and many business chats, forcing OpenAI to break =
its own privacy commitments to users.
The NYT-backed overreach disregards user privacy, sets up massive legal con=
flicts with GDPR in the EU, and likely does nothing substantive to prove co=
pyright infringement. It=E2=80=99s overreach that reflects a fundamental mi=
sunderstanding of how LLMs work.
What the heck is going on?
Filing date & venue. The New York Times Co. v. OpenAI & Microsoft was filed=
 on December 27 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District o=
f New York (case no. 23-cv-11195, now part of MDL 25-md-3143).
Core allegation. The Times says the defendants copied =E2=80=9Cmillions=E2=
=80=9D of Times articles to train GPT models, infringing copyright and thre=
atening its subscription business.
Preservation order. On May 13 2025 Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang ordered Ope=
nAI to =E2=80=9Cpreserve and segregate all output log data that would other=
wise be deleted=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94including chats users had already erased=
=E2=80=94until further notice. She later denied OpenAI=E2=80=99s motion to =
narrow or reconsider that directive.
District Judge Sidney H. Stein is the Article III judge presiding over the =
broader case (The New York Times Co. v. OpenAI & Microsoft). OpenAI filed a=
n objection/appeal to him on June 3 2025 asking that he vacate or modify Ju=
dge Wang=E2=80=99s order.
Scope of the order. It sweeps in all data from ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, Tea=
m, and standard API users; only Enterprise, Edu, and Zero-Data-Retention (Z=
DR) API customers are excluded.
OpenAI=E2=80=99s policy conflict. Before the order, consumer chats were era=
sed after 30 days, and ZDR API calls were never logged.
Reconsideration denied. Judge Wang rejected OpenAI=E2=80=99s motion to narr=
ow the order on May 16 2025.
Appeal. OpenAI asked District Judge Sidney H. Stein to vacate the order on =
June 3 2025 and went public with its objections on June 6 2025.
Public stance. CEO Sam Altman said on X, =E2=80=9CWe will fight any demand =
that compromises our users=E2=80=99 privacy,=E2=80=9D even floating an =E2=
=80=9CAI privilege=E2=80=9D akin to attorney=E2=80=93client confidentiality=
=2E
Potential legal clash. Commentators note the order is hard to square with G=
DPR data-minimization and the EU =E2=80=9Cright to erasure.=E2=80=9D That=
=E2=80=99s putting it mildly.
Why this matters (opinions ahead!)
I try to be even-handed a lot, and I think this is pretty even-handed tbh
I=E2=80=99m not making this call to protect OpenAI in any way. They aren=E2=
=80=99t perfect. They make mistakes. I will continue to call those out. The=
 last time I called out a poor product implementation on their side was thi=
s week [ https://substack.com/redirect/d927e1b2-6f73-46b2-b499-7dcaf31c12f8=
?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
But no matter what the merits of the case, this ruling is an absolute trave=
sty for AI users. Not just ChatGPT users! It casts a chilling effect across=
 the entire industry. And it=E2=80=99s horrendous that a so-called safeguar=
d of the consumer (the NYT) has demanded it. We need to demand better LLM f=
luency from the media.
I=E2=80=99m particularly furious because the court has just forced OpenAI t=
o do the very thing critics always complain about=E2=80=94hoard our persona=
l conversations=E2=80=94yet the long arm of government rooting through mill=
ions of private conversations solves exactly none of the copyright question=
s in The New York Times v. OpenAI.=20
Yep. NONE.
Here=E2=80=99s why the log-hoarding demand is a dead end for the copyright =
claims: the lawsuit hinges on what went into GPT-4=E2=80=99s weights during=
 training and whether that ingestion was transformative fair use or straigh=
t-up infringement.=20
Those training runs were frozen months before ChatGPT ever launched. Captur=
ing billions of post-training chats tells you nothing about that historical=
 data set=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s like subpoenaing every email sent from an iP=
hone to prove Apple stole a song to train Siri.=20
At best, user logs might reveal occasional snippets of Times prose the mode=
l regurgitates, but the Times already demonstrated that in its complaint wi=
th a handful of cherry-picked prompts.=20
If they need more examples, a targeted test suite would surface them in an =
afternoon; forcing OpenAI to warehouse the entire global chat stream is mas=
sive overkill. Most critically, the presence (or absence) of a verbatim quo=
te in an output log cannot answer the legal question the court must decide:=
 whether ingesting those articles in the first place was lawful. That turns=
 on statutory factors like transformation and market harm=E2=80=94not on wh=
at random users typed to the model last night.
Bottom line: neither Judge Wang nor the NYT understands how LLMs actually w=
ork. It shows. And it=E2=80=99s hurting all of us.
And this isn=E2=80=99t a one-time thing! As I noted above in the facts=E2=
=80=94in May Judge Wang ordered the company to =E2=80=9Cpreserve and segreg=
ate all ChatGPT output logs indefinitely,=E2=80=9D a directive prompted by =
the Times=E2=80=99 discovery demands. Indefinitely. While the case runs on.=
 Possibly for years. It=E2=80=99s nothing less than a torpedo at the heart =
of AI trust.
The sheer scope of the order is breathtaking. It sweeps in every prompt and=
 response from anyone on ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, Team, or the standard API=
=E2=80=94even data users already deleted. Only Enterprise, Edu, and Zero-Da=
ta-Retention API customers are exempt. OpenAI is absolutely right to warn t=
hat this contradicts its long-standing 30-day deletion policy and =E2=80=9C=
abandons privacy norms=E2=80=9D that protect everyday users.
Why is the Times asking for this trove? As I noted, the newspaper claims it=
 needs the logs to show that OpenAI encourages infringement. But that betra=
ys a fundamental misunderstanding of how large-language models work. The qu=
estion in a copyright case is whether training data contained protected tex=
t=E2=80=94not what users later typed into the chat box. Preserving billions=
 of post-training conversations won=E2=80=99t reveal what went into GPT-4=
=E2=80=99s weights two years ago; it merely warehouses private data that is=
 irrelevant to the alleged wrongdoing.
Judge Stein=E2=80=99s decision therefore creates a perverse situation: to =
=E2=80=9Cprotect=E2=80=9D an 18-month-old newspaper archive, the court unde=
rmines live, private conversations between millions of citizens and AI chat=
 instances they regard as personal companions. That is the definition of ju=
dicial overreach. It also hands ammunition to every critic who warns that A=
I companies can=E2=80=94and now must=E2=80=94keep everything we say forever=
=2E Public trust in AI was fragile before; this is a sledgehammer blow.
There is also a blatant ethical hypocrisy here. The Times routinely positio=
ns itself as a principled watchdog on technology, lecturing Silicon Valley =
on surveillance and privacy abuses. Yet it has asked a court to impose one =
of the most sweeping data-retention orders in tech-policy history. That req=
uest does not =E2=80=9Celevate the ethics of AI=E2=80=9D in any recognizabl=
e sense; it weaponizes discovery to score legal points while disregarding t=
he collateral damage to user privacy.
Nor does the order make sense under global privacy regimes. OpenAI now risk=
s conflict with the GDPR=E2=80=99s data-minimization and right-to-erasure d=
octrines for European users, and similar statutes elsewhere, because a U.S.=
 judge insists the company must hold on to data those very laws tell it to =
delete. OpenAI says it will store the logs in a sealed, audited enclave acc=
essible only to a small legal team, but that doesn=E2=80=99t cure the under=
lying legal paradox.
The chilling effect is immediate. There are going to be enterprises who pau=
se internal ChatGPT pilots until the appeal is resolved. If courts can comp=
el indefinite retention on a whim, every compliance team in the Fortune 500=
 will rethink AI adoption. Ironically, a lawsuit meant to =E2=80=9Cprotect =
journalism=E2=80=9D now risks slowing the responsible deployment of the ver=
y technology that could help newsrooms thrive.
And I can=E2=80=99t help but wonder how unwelcome such a chilling effect wo=
uld be in the NYT newsroom=E2=80=94if the Grey Lady really does see this as=
 an existential war with OpenAI, then attacking your enemy=E2=80=99s abilit=
y to get revenue makes sense.
Part of what is frustrating is that there were narrower, saner paths. The T=
imes could have requested a capped sample of logs linked to specific allege=
d infringements or accepted hashed-match evidence rather than a raw data du=
mp. Instead, we got a blanket order that tramples user rights, teaches the =
public to distrust AI platforms, and still won=E2=80=99t answer whether GPT=
-4=E2=80=99s training set unlawfully copied Times articles. That is bad law=
 and worse technology policy, and I hope the district court vacates it befo=
re lasting damage is done.
A parting plea to journalists
Guys, I believe you mean well. I do. I don=E2=80=99t assume all of you have=
 a particular stance on this lawsuit! I=E2=80=99m certainly not blaming you=
 for what a judge decided or even for what one media company chose.=20
I can distinguish between journalists and boardrooms.=20
But there=E2=80=99s something you can do in all this that we desperately ne=
ed: take the time to understand AI so you can report on it accurately. My n=
ote on how AI actually works in pre-training and how that inherently impact=
s claims made in this case isn=E2=80=99t brilliant or new. It should be tab=
le stakes journalism to understand how LLMs work well enough to report on t=
hese kinds of claims correctly.=20
If anyone in journalism has serious claims they=E2=80=99re investigating an=
d want a perspective on how AI actually works, my DMs are open. So is my em=
ail. I do not care if you cite me or if I am on background. I just want you=
 to not misinform the public. Please.
And last but not least if you=E2=80=99re not in journalism, share this with=
 someone who doesn=E2=80=99t understand this case or needs to hear about th=
e privacy news! No one should be misinformed.
