So OpenAI launched Sora 2, but really they launched a social network. And i=
t=E2=80=99s a big enough deal for all of us that I want to write a free and=
 open post about it.
We=E2=80=99re all social media users. We should all get to debate whether t=
his is a good thing or not, so sound off in the comments!
Subscribers get all these posts!
OpenAI Just Launched a Social Network. Here=E2=80=99s Why That Actually Mak=
es Sense (for them)
OpenAI dropped Sora 2 last week, and the internet immediately started askin=
g the same question: why is a chat company building Instagram?
The answer tells you everything about where OpenAI is headed, and it=E2=80=
=99s not what most people think.
First, let=E2=80=99s get the obvious part out of the way. Sora 2 isn=E2=80=
=99t just a video generation tool. It=E2=80=99s a social network, full stop=
=2E You create videos, you share them w=
ith friends, you insert yourself as a=20=
cameo into AI-generated clips and send them back and forth. It=E2=80=99s de=
signed for the kind of ephemeral, playful interaction that used to define e=
arly Facebook and Instagram, before they became algorithmic content mills.
The product itself represents a meaningful step forward from Sora 1. Rememb=
er that splashy launch earlier in 2024 with the beautiful demo page? And th=
en the somewhat underwhelming reality when it actually shipped a few months=
 later? OpenAI clearly learned from that. Sora 2 generates videos up to 16 =
seconds now, the sound is better, and most importantly, they=E2=80=99ve tho=
ught hard about what kind of social experience they want to create. They di=
dn=E2=80=99t just ship a tool. They shipped a context for how that tool sho=
uld be used. And it=E2=80=99s immediately useful (by invite at least).
Reading the text (and subtext) from launch: OpenAI is terrified of being as=
sociated with AI slop.
They=E2=80=99ve watched Meta get absolutely hammered in the press for AI gi=
rlfriends, fake charity scams, and generally making the internet worse. The=
y=E2=80=99ve seen the perception calcify that AI is ruining social media, f=
illing it with synthetic garbage that nobody asked for. And they know that =
if ChatGPT becomes synonymous with low-quality AI content flooding the web,=
 they=E2=80=99re cooked.
So Sora 2 is their answer. It=E2=80=99s a proof point that AI can power pos=
itive, creative interaction between real people. You can=E2=80=99t use Sora=
 2 without using AI, but you=E2=80=99re not using it to spam or scam or gen=
erate slop. You=E2=80=99re using it to make something genuinely fun with yo=
ur friends. The viral feature, the cameo insertion where you cast yourself =
and your friends into videos and send them back and forth, is brilliant pre=
cisely because it=E2=80=99s inherently social and inherently AI-powered. Yo=
u simply can=E2=80=99t do this without the technology, but the technology i=
s in service of genuine human connection.
Even if Sora 2 doesn=E2=80=99t become the next big social platform, it=E2=
=80=99s still a win for OpenAI because it demonstrates a constructive path =
forward. That matters more than most people realize, especially right now w=
hen the narrative around AI and social media is so toxic.
This is also functioning as training wheels for a generation of people lear=
ning to be creative with AI in new ways. The interactions are low-stakes, t=
he format is forgiving, and the social context makes it feel natural rather=
 than intimidating. That=E2=80=99s valuable infrastructure for OpenAI=E2=80=
=99s long-term vision.
But let=E2=80=99s talk about the elephant in the room: monetization.
OpenAI is building toward a billion users, likely this year. And there=E2=
=80=99s a gravitational pull on the internet that=E2=80=99s hard to resist.=
 When you hit that scale, you either become an ad network or you=E2=80=99re=
 leaving massive amounts of money on the table. Look at every consumer app =
that=E2=80=99s ever reached this scale. They all end up in the same place: =
attention plus relationships equals ads.
The moves are already in motion. OpenAI just hired a head of monetization. =
They launched Pulse for pro users, which looks suspiciously like a feed tha=
t could accommodate sponsored content. They=E2=80=99re working with Etsy an=
d Shopify on checkout within ChatGPT, which would give them the complete pu=
rchase funnel from discovery to transaction. And now they=E2=80=99ve launch=
ed Sora 2, which is basically a ready-made ad surface that doesn=E2=80=99t =
touch the core ChatGPT experience.
This is the strategic hedge. They can monetize through ads on new surfaces =
like Pulse and Sora 2 while keeping ChatGPT itself feeling trustworthy and =
uncompromised. You still go to ChatGPT for answers you can trust. But you g=
et served ads when you=E2=80=99re scrolling through Pulse or watching Sora =
videos, where the stakes are lower and the context is different.
The persistent concern I keep hearing is about integrity. How do you mainta=
in trust in a system that gives you answers when someone can pay to influen=
ce those answers? It feels like the kind of thing that rots a product from =
within. And OpenAI is clearly self-aware enough to know this is a problem t=
hey need to solve.
Launching separate surfaces might be how they thread that needle. You get a=
ds in Pulse. You get ads on Sora 2. But they don=E2=80=99t touch ChatGPT it=
self, at least not initially. The core product maintains its reputation for=
 trustworthiness while the newer, lower-stakes surfaces carry the monetizat=
ion load.
I=E2=80=99m not saying this is the complete solution. They may eventually n=
eed to figure out how to responsibly integrate ads into ChatGPT itself. But=
 starting with these other surfaces buys them time to figure out the right =
approach, and it gives them revenue without immediately compromising the pr=
oduct that built their brand.
The real question isn=E2=80=99t whether OpenAI will run ads. It=E2=80=99s w=
hether they can pull off this balancing act, keeping the core product prist=
ine while building new surfaces that generate revenue without generating ba=
cklash.
The timing here is also worth noting. They launched Sora 2 right before the=
 holidays, which means they=E2=80=99re clearly thinking about Q4, about Bla=
ck Friday and Cyber Monday, about getting telemetry on how people interact =
with this kind of product during peak shopping season. Even if they=E2=80=
=99re not running ads yet, they=E2=80=99re gathering the data they=E2=80=99=
ll need to make smart decisions about monetization down the line.
And there=E2=80=99s a competitive dimension to this launch that goes beyond=
 just beating other AI labs to market. They=E2=80=99re stealing a march on =
Google, Snap, and Meta. All three will now be looking at how to get into th=
is space, but OpenAI has first-mover advantage on the specific format of AI=
-powered social interaction between friends.
Google is currently leaning hard into Gemini Nano everywhere you look. TV a=
ds, TikTok ads, ads across the internet. They=E2=80=99re pushing Lovable du=
ring this build week. It=E2=80=99s a bit of a defensive play, trying to kee=
p attention on their cool thing so you don=E2=80=99t get too distracted by =
OpenAI=E2=80=99s cool thing. But they haven=E2=80=99t launched anything in =
the social network space in years, and there=E2=80=99s a reason for that. I=
t=E2=80=99s hard.
Meta is actively building in this direction, but they=E2=80=99ve been getti=
ng absolutely roasted in the press for how they=E2=80=99re approaching AI o=
n their platforms. The AI slop problem is real for them, and their brand re=
putation is suffering. OpenAI has a chance to position themselves as the re=
sponsible alternative, the company that figured out how to make AI social w=
ithout making social media worse.
And Snap? Snap should genuinely be worried.
Snap built its entire business on ephemeral, friend-to-friend interaction. =
That=E2=80=99s exactly what Sora 2 is designed for. The difference is that =
Sora 2 has AI superpowers baked in from day one, and it=E2=80=99s launching=
 on top of ChatGPT=E2=80=99s massive existing user base. If OpenAI can nail=
 the product experience and build the right culture early (which is why it=
=E2=80=99s invite-only right now), they could genuinely steal a march on Sn=
ap in a way that feels inevitable in retrospect.
The choice to go friend-oriented rather than content-oriented is interestin=
g. They could have built something more like TikTok, focused on algorithmic=
 content discovery and creator monetization. Instead they=E2=80=99re going =
for the old Facebook model, the old Instagram model, where it=E2=80=99s fun=
damentally about you and your friends. That=E2=80=99s a bet on a specific k=
ind of social graph and a specific kind of interaction pattern.
It=E2=80=99s early days. I remember when Threads launched and everyone thou=
ght it was going to be the Twitter killer, and then we watched the long, co=
mplicated fallout as people tried to figure out what Threads actually was a=
nd whether they wanted to use it. Sora 2 is on day one right now. The cultu=
re that develops around it, the ecosystem of creators they attract during t=
his invite-only phase, the norms that get established early, all of that wi=
ll determine whether this actually works.
But the strategic logic is clearer than most people realize. OpenAI isn=E2=
=80=99t pivoting. They=E2=80=99re not suddenly becoming a social media comp=
any because they ran out of ideas for AI. They=E2=80=99re showing you what =
they=E2=80=99ve been building toward all along.
So what is OpenAI, really? They=E2=80=99re not a chat company. They=E2=80=
=99re an intelligence company that=E2=80=99s figuring out how to wrap delig=
htful experiences around that intelligence at massive scale. Chat is one in=
terface. A social network is another. Checkout is another. Pulse is another=
=2E These all make sense once you stop=20=
thinking about OpenAI as a product and=
 start thinking about them as a platform.
The beating heart of the company is the billion-user base. Everything else =
follows from that. The enterprise arm and the R&D arm help with profitabili=
ty and the P&L, but the consumer brand is what keeps the engine running. Pa=
rt of why enterprise customers have ChatGPT on the table is because everyon=
e has heard of it. You need that popular support even on the B2B side. Bran=
d perception at consumer scale matters for everything else the company does=
=2E
And here=E2=80=99s the thing that makes this inevitable: OpenAI would be th=
e only billion-user company that isn=E2=80=99t an ad network if they didn=
=E2=80=99t do ads. They would be the only billion-user company that isn=E2=
=80=99t a social network if they didn=E2=80=99t do social. There are center=
s of gravity on the internet. When you get to a certain scale, you head tow=
ard ads and you head toward social. It=E2=80=99s just what happens. It=E2=
=80=99s how you make money off relationships and attention at scale.
The question was never whether OpenAI would get into these businesses. The =
question was always how they=E2=80=99d do it, and whether they could do it =
without compromising the thing that made them valuable in the first place.
Sora 2 is their first real answer to that question. We=E2=80=99ll see if it=
 works.

t Actually Makes Sense (for them)</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">OpenAI dropped =
Sora 2 last week, and the internet immediately started asking the same ques=
tion: why is a chat company building Instagram?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The answer =
tells you everything about where OpenAI is headed, and it=E2=80=99s not wha=
t most people think.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First, let=E2=80=99s get the obvious p=
art out of the way. Sora 2 isn=E2=80=99t just a video generation tool. It=
=E2=80=99s a social network, full stop. You create videos, you share them w=
ith friends, you insert yourself as a cameo into AI-generated clips and sen=
d them back and forth. It=E2=80=99s designed for the kind of ephemeral, pla=
yful interaction that used to define early Facebook and Instagram, before t=
hey became algorithmic content mills.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The product itself re=
presents a meaningful step forward from Sora 1. Remember that splashy launc=
h earlier in 2024 with the beautiful demo page? And then the somewhat under=
whelming reality when it actually shipped a few months later? OpenAI clearl=
y learned from that. Sora 2 generates videos up to 16 seconds now, the soun=
d is better, and most importantly, they=E2=80=99ve thought hard about what =
kind of social experience they want to create. They didn=E2=80=99t just shi=
p a tool. They shipped a context for how that tool should be used. And it=
=E2=80=99s immediately useful (by invite at least).</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Reading=
 the text (and subtext) from launch: OpenAI is terrified of being associate=
d with AI slop.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">They=E2=80=99ve watched Meta get absolutely=
 hammered in the press for AI girlfriends, fake charity scams, and generall=
y making the internet worse. They=E2=80=99ve seen the perception calcify th=
at AI is ruining social media, filling it with synthetic garbage that nobod=
y asked for. And they know that if ChatGPT becomes synonymous with low-qual=
ity AI content flooding the web, they=E2=80=99re cooked.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So=
 Sora 2 is their answer. It=E2=80=99s a proof point that AI can power posit=
ive, creative interaction between real people. You can=E2=80=99t use Sora 2=
 without using AI, but you=E2=80=99re not using it to spam or scam or gener=
ate slop. You=E2=80=99re using it to make something genuinely fun with your=
 friends. The viral feature, the cameo insertion where you cast yourself an=
d your friends into videos and send them back and forth, is brilliant preci=
sely because it=E2=80=99s inherently social and inherently AI-powered. You =
simply can=E2=80=99t do this without the technology, but the technology is =
in service of genuine human connection.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;c=
olor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Even if Sora 2 does=
n=E2=80=99t become the next big social platform, it=E2=80=99s still a win f=
or OpenAI because it demonstrates a constructive path forward. That matters=
 more than most people realize, especially right now when the narrative aro=
und AI and social media is so toxic.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is also functioni=
ng as training wheels for a generation of people learning to be creative wi=
th AI in new ways. The interactions are low-stakes, the format is forgiving=
, and the social context makes it feel natural rather than intimidating. Th=
at=E2=80=99s valuable infrastructure for OpenAI=E2=80=99s long-term vision.=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">But let=E2=80=99s talk about the elephant in the room: mon=
etization.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">OpenAI is building toward a billion users, likel=
y this year. And there=E2=80=99s a gravitational pull on the internet that=
=E2=80=99s hard to resist. When you hit that scale, you either become an ad=
 network or you=E2=80=99re leaving massive amounts of money on the table. L=
ook at every consumer app that=E2=80=99s ever reached this scale. They all =
end up in the same place: attention plus relationships equals ads.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">The moves are already in motion. OpenAI just hired a head of moneti=
zation. They launched Pulse for pro users, which looks suspiciously like a =
feed that could accommodate sponsored content. They=E2=80=99re working with=
 Etsy and Shopify on checkout within ChatGPT, which would give them the com=
plete purchase funnel from discovery to transaction. And now they=E2=80=99v=
e launched Sora 2, which is basically a ready-made ad surface that doesn=E2=
=80=99t touch the core ChatGPT experience.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is the stra=
tegic hedge. They can monetize through ads on new surfaces like Pulse and S=
ora 2 while keeping ChatGPT itself feeling trustworthy and uncompromised. Y=
ou still go to ChatGPT for answers you can trust. But you get served ads wh=
en you=E2=80=99re scrolling through Pulse or watching Sora videos, where th=
e stakes are lower and the context is different.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The persis=
tent concern I keep hearing is about integrity. How do you maintain trust i=
n a system that gives you answers when someone can pay to influence those a=
nswers? It feels like the kind of thing that rots a product from within. An=
d OpenAI is clearly self-aware enough to know this is a problem they need t=
o solve.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Launching separate surfaces might be how they thre=
ad that needle. You get ads in Pulse. You get ads on Sora 2. But they don=
=E2=80=99t touch ChatGPT itself, at least not initially. The core product m=
aintains its reputation for trustworthiness while the newer, lower-stakes s=
urfaces carry the monetization load.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=E2=80=99m not saying=
 this is the complete solution. They may eventually need to figure out how =
to responsibly integrate ads into ChatGPT itself. But starting with these o=
ther surfaces buys them time to figure out the right approach, and it gives=
 them revenue without immediately compromising the product that built their=
 brand.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">The real question isn=E2=80=99t whether OpenAI will=
 run ads. It=E2=80=99s whether they can pull off this balancing act, keepin=
g the core product pristine while building new surfaces that generate reven=
ue without generating backlash.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The timing here is also wor=
th noting. They launched Sora 2 right before the holidays, which means they=
=E2=80=99re clearly thinking about Q4, about Black Friday and Cyber Monday,=
 about getting telemetry on how people interact with this kind of product d=
uring peak shopping season. Even if they=E2=80=99re not running ads yet, th=
ey=E2=80=99re gathering the data they=E2=80=99ll need to make smart decisio=
ns about monetization down the line.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And there=E2=80=99s a =
competitive dimension to this launch that goes beyond just beating other AI=
 labs to market. They=E2=80=99re stealing a march on Google, Snap, and Meta=
. All three will now be looking at how to get into this space, but OpenAI h=
as first-mover advantage on the specific format of AI-powered social intera=
ction between friends.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Google is currently leaning hard int=
o Gemini Nano everywhere you look. TV ads, TikTok ads, ads across the inter=
net. They=E2=80=99re pushing Lovable during this build week. It=E2=80=99s a=
 bit of a defensive play, trying to keep attention on their cool thing so y=
ou don=E2=80=99t get too distracted by OpenAI=E2=80=99s cool thing. But the=
y haven=E2=80=99t launched anything in the social network space in years, a=
nd there=E2=80=99s a reason for that. It=E2=80=99s hard.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Me=
ta is actively building in this direction, but they=E2=80=99ve been getting=
 absolutely roasted in the press for how they=E2=80=99re approaching AI on =
their platforms. The AI slop problem is real for them, and their brand repu=
tation is suffering. OpenAI has a chance to position themselves as the resp=
onsible alternative, the company that figured out how to make AI social wit=
hout making social media worse.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And Snap? Snap should genui=
nely be worried.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Snap built its entire business on ephemera=
l, friend-to-friend interaction. That=E2=80=99s exactly what Sora 2 is desi=
gned for. The difference is that Sora 2 has AI superpowers baked in from da=
y one, and it=E2=80=99s launching on top of ChatGPT=E2=80=99s massive exist=
ing user base. If OpenAI can nail the product experience and build the righ=
t culture early (which is why it=E2=80=99s invite-only right now), they cou=
ld genuinely steal a march on Snap in a way that feels inevitable in retros=
pect.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">The choice to go friend-oriented rather than content-=
oriented is interesting. They could have built something more like TikTok, =
focused on algorithmic content discovery and creator monetization. Instead =
they=E2=80=99re going for the old Facebook model, the old Instagram model, =
where it=E2=80=99s fundamentally about you and your friends. That=E2=80=99s=
 a bet on a specific kind of social graph and a specific kind of interactio=
n pattern.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It=E2=80=99s early days. I remember when Threads=
 launched and everyone thought it was going to be the Twitter killer, and t=
hen we watched the long, complicated fallout as people tried to figure out =
what Threads actually was and whether they wanted to use it. Sora 2 is on d=
ay one right now. The culture that develops around it, the ecosystem of cre=
ators they attract during this invite-only phase, the norms that get establ=
ished early, all of that will determine whether this actually works.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">But the strategic logic is clearer than most people realize. Open=
AI isn=E2=80=99t pivoting. They=E2=80=99re not suddenly becoming a social m=
edia company because they ran out of ideas for AI. They=E2=80=99re showing =
you what they=E2=80=99ve been building toward all along.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So=
 what is OpenAI, really? They=E2=80=99re not a chat company. They=E2=80=99r=
e an intelligence company that=E2=80=99s figuring out how to wrap delightfu=
l experiences around that intelligence at massive scale. Chat is one interf=
ace. A social network is another. Checkout is another. Pulse is another. Th=
ese all make sense once you stop thinking about OpenAI as a product and sta=
rt thinking about them as a platform.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The beating heart of =
the company is the billion-user base. Everything else follows from that. Th=
e enterprise arm and the R&amp;D arm help with profitability and the P&amp;=
L, but the consumer brand is what keeps the engine running. Part of why ent=
erprise customers have ChatGPT on the table is because everyone has heard o=
f it. You need that popular support even on the B2B side. Brand perception =
at consumer scale matters for everything else the company does.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">And here=E2=80=99s the thing that makes this inevitable: OpenAI would =
be the only billion-user company that isn=E2=80=99t an ad network if they d=
idn=E2=80=99t do ads. They would be the only billion-user company that isn=
=E2=80=99t a social network if they didn=E2=80=99t do social. There are cen=
ters of gravity on the internet. When you get to a certain scale, you head =
toward ads and you head toward social. It=E2=80=99s just what happens. It=
=E2=80=99s how you make money off relationships and attention at scale.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">The question was never whether OpenAI would get into these bus=
inesses. The question was always how they=E2=80=99d do it, and whether they=
 could do it without compromising the thing that made them valuable in the =
first place.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Sora 2 is their first real answer to that ques=
tion. We=E2=80=99ll see if it works.</p><div class=3D"subscription-widget-w=
