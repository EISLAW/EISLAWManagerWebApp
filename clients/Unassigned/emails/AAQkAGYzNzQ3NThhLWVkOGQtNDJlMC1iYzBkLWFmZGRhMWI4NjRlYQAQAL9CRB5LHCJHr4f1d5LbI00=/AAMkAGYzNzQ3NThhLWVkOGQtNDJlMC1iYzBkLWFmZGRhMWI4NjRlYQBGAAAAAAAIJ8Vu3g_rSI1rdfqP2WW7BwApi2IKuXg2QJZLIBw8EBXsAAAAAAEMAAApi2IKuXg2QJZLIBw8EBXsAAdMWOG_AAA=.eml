I told myself I wouldn't do this again. After my 66-page prompt opus in Apr=
il [ https://substack.com/redirect/ad8dde63-ee49-404f-9592-6d8f981c21e5?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], I swo=
re I'd keep things shorter. More digestible. Reader-friendly.=20
[Narrator voice: He did not keep things shorter because there=E2=80=99s too=
 much good stuff.]
This collection is ~145 pages long. It contains 39 essential prompts in a d=
etailed Google Doc, many with multiple variants, plus 6 pages of context th=
at explains why prompting has fundamentally changed in 2025. And yes, there=
's a table of contents in that Google Doc so you can actually navigate this=
 beast and find exactly what you need.
Because my longing to suffer, why did I write another novel-length prompt g=
uide? Because something clicked for me recently. I realized my prompts and =
how I talk about them needed to evolve to keep pace with frontier model cap=
abilities. And with ChatGPT-5 on the horizon (rumored for July), I wanted t=
o bring the prompt stack up to snuff with what today=E2=80=99s models can d=
o.=20
These aren't random prompts I think might be useful. These are the 39 promp=
ts I have labored over, technically, repeatedly, as many different ways as =
I can think of to make them excellent.
How?=20
By checking them vs. actual published prompting guides (I list 18 of them b=
elow) to ensure they adhere to best practices (lots of these have been publ=
ished since April)
By developing multiple variants to give you different options depending on =
your level of effort
By choosing a range of prompts that cover the full spectrum of decision-mak=
ing I see actually cropping up in work (and life)
That last is key: I find a lot of my earlier prompt work has been a bit con=
strained by earlier model intelligence levels. I=E2=80=99ve felt like I nee=
ded to constrain to particular job families in the past because earlier mod=
els leaned into fairly defined work and task completion assignments. And th=
at has value!
But we can do more cool stuff with the newer models. There=E2=80=99s a chan=
ce with these newer models to ask much more ambiguous questions.
Like: When I need to make a decision that will affect the next five years. =
When I'm staring at feedback that stings and need to figure out what's actu=
ally useful in it. When a project is falling apart and I need structured th=
inking, not panic. When I'm trying to learn something new and don't want to=
 waste months on bad approaches.
I've been living with these frontier models=E2=80=94Claude 4, o3 Pro, Gemin=
i 2.5 Pro=E2=80=94like they're colleagues. Maybe closer than colleagues. We=
've developed a working relationship where I know exactly how to activate t=
heir best thinking, and they know (through my prompts) exactly what kind of=
 thought partnership I need.
Each prompt in this collection does something specific:
Turn vague anxiety into clear action (Future Regret Minimizer, Change Readi=
ness Evaluator)
Extract signal from noise (Dynamic Qualitative Insight Explorer, Strategic =
Feedback Interpreter)
Force hard choices (Comprehensive Tradeoff Analyzer, Meeting Killer)
Design better systems (Database Schema Designer, Automation Opportunity Sca=
nner)
Navigate complex human dynamics (Stakeholder Navigation Guide, Multi-Perspe=
ctive Simulator)
But here's what matters more: these prompts are really complete thinking sy=
stems, not just questions. They include context setup, phase-by-phase workf=
lows, specific output formats, and iteration loops. They assume the AI is g=
enuinely intelligent and just needs clear structure to be helpful. And that=
=E2=80=99s definitely a marker of the time we=E2=80=99re in=E2=80=94the blu=
rry, gentle singularity [ https://substack.com/redirect/e9356f11-892f-4da1-=
b624-acd985e78fe1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ].
The Google Doc is designed to be scannable and searchable. Eight major sect=
ions. Clear numbering. Purpose statements for each prompt so you know when =
to use it. You can bookmark it and come back whenever you face that type of=
 challenge. Think of it as your emergency toolkit for complexity.
I've also included something new: detailed notes on how prompting itself ha=
s evolved. How specificity works to drive model outputs. How to use the new=
 massive context windows strategically. Why breaking complex tasks into pha=
ses isn't about helping the AI anymore=E2=80=94it's about helping us.
These prompts work with any frontier model=E2=80=94Claude 4, o3 Pro, o3, Ge=
mini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3. And I=E2=80=99ve designed them to be built with the g=
rain of the emerging intelligence patterns we=E2=80=99re seeing, so they sh=
ould set you up for GPT-5 later in the summer. Yes I said it.=20
How?? I=E2=80=99ve cross-referenced these prompts across the different mode=
l makers=E2=80=99 prompting guides to make sure they can be used as-is as m=
uch as possible. The principles hold because they're based on the commonali=
ties in how these models actually process information, not on platform-spec=
ific tricks.
Fair warning: this isn't light reading. Each prompt is densely packed with =
structure and logic. But that's the point. When you need to think clearly a=
bout something that matters, you don't want a vague suggestion. You want a =
systematic process that reliably produces insight. And the point is that no=
w you can just take these prompts and be off to the races.
If you've been following my prompt journey for the last few months, this is=
 where it's led. If you're new, this is everything I've learned compressed =
into immediately usable tools. Either way, these 39 prompts will change how=
 you work with AI=E2=80=94from occasional assistant to genuine thinking par=
tner.
Time to dig in. The prompts are waiting.
PS. For those wanting both the full podcast from the video and a nice voice=
 reading the whole post=E2=80=94I got you covered. Separate audio for the p=
ost just below!
Subscribers get all these pieces!

8YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], from strategy to synthesis. I thi=
nk those posts resonated because they moved beyond "here's a template" to "=
here's how to think about prompting systematically."
Those foundations still matter. The techniques still work. But the landscap=
e keeps evolving, and so does our understanding of what's possible.
The Capability Ceiling Keeps Rising
When I wrote the Prompt Spellbook in February, we were working with models =
that are already a generation back. The techniques I shared=E2=80=94meta-pr=
ompting, error detection, iterative loops=E2=80=94remain powerful tools. Th=
ey taught us how to think systematically about AI interaction.
Now it's June 2025. Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Code, o3 Pro=E2=
=80=94these models build on their predecessors' strengths while adding new =
capabilities. They maintain complex analytical frameworks across tens of th=
ousands of tokens, or more. They apply judgment to ambiguous situations. Th=
ey reason through implications with increasing sophistication.
Bottom line: the new models open up new possibilities for how we structure =
our prompts and what we can achieve with them.
From Techniques to Complete Systems
Here=E2=80=99s how it all fits together: My earlier posts taught essential =
techniques=E2=80=94the building blocks of good prompting. Those remain valu=
able. You still need to understand meta-prompting, chain-of-thought, output=
 formatting. Those are fundamentals that everything else builds on.
These 39 prompts represent the next evolution. They're meant to be complete=
 thinking systems that incorporate those earlier techniques while pushing f=
urther. Each one is a fully-realized workflow that leverages what only toda=
y's (and tomorrow=E2=80=99) models can do. They don't replace the basics=E2=
=80=94they show what becomes possible when you master them.
Take the Fresh Perspective Generator (#1). It builds on the multi-perspecti=
ve techniques from February but adds layers of structural specificity that =
today's models can handle brilliantly: exactly three perspectives ordered f=
rom practical to radical, each with precise word counts and required elemen=
ts. It's the same foundation, evolved.
Why These 39 Prompts Specifically
I chose these 39 prompts because they reflect a fundamental shift in how we=
 use AI in 2025. It's not just about work anymore. These models have crosse=
d over into every aspect of how we think, decide, and navigate life.
The Life Stack Principle
Look at what these prompts actually cover:
Career decisions that shape decades (Future Regret Minimizer, #28)
Personal energy and how we spend our days (Energy Audit Protocol, #30)
Relationship dynamics at work and beyond (Stakeholder Navigation, #32)
Learning new skills for growth or joy (Skill Breakdown Blueprint, #27)
Crisis moments that test everything (Crisis Communications, #37)
Life transitions big and small (Change Readiness Evaluator, #20)
This isn't a random collection. It's a reflection of how AI partnership now=
 touches every significant moment=E2=80=94from morning energy management to=
 major life decisions. The prompts mirror the full spectrum of challenges w=
e actually face.
The Specificity Requirement
Every prompt had to pass a simple test: Is it specific enough to be immedia=
tely useful? Not "analyze my career" but "evaluate my leadership style agai=
nst Goleman's framework [ https://substack.com/redirect/999f54c8-425e-4024-=
b8a5-5fd7d50db535?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ] and create a 30-day development plan." Not "help me decide" bu=
t "run a comprehensive tradeoff analysis with second-order effects and scor=
ing."
This specificity isn't limiting=E2=80=94it's liberating. When you know exac=
tly what to ask for, you get exactly what you need. The models can handle t=
he specificity. More importantly, the specificity forces clarity in your ow=
n thinking.
And yes, I get that using fancy prompts is hard when you have to build them=
 from scratch. That=E2=80=99s why I built this for you lol
The Completeness Test
With 39 prompts, you have coverage for the pretty much the full range of wo=
rk and life problem solving with AI.
Strategic thinking and planning
Decision making under uncertainty
Communication across contexts
Time and energy optimization
Skill development and learning
Relationship navigation
Technical problem solving
Crisis management and recovery
Each prompt is complete enough to use immediately, yet modular enough to ad=
apt. Together, they form an operating system for navigating complexity=E2=
=80=94whether that complexity shows up at work, at home, or in the transiti=
ons between.
Building on What Came Before
These prompts don't invalidate the earlier work. They build on it. The Prom=
pt Spellbook taught you to think in terms of techniques and patterns. My Pr=
ompt Stack showed you how to apply those patterns to real work challenges. =
This collection takes the next step: showing what's possible when you combi=
ne mastery of technique with the expanded capabilities of current models.
If you're new to prompting, you might want to start with the earlier posts =
to build your foundation. If you've been following along, these 39 prompts =
show you where to go next. Either way, each piece of the journey has value.
What These Prompts Reveal About Modern Prompting
Looking across all 39, several principles emerge that extend what we learne=
d before:
Extreme specificity enhances rather than constrains. We always knew specifi=
city helped. Now we know that current models use ultra-specific constraints=
 as focusing mechanisms that actually improve creativity and usefulness.
Multi-phase workflows are now native. We used to break things into steps to=
 help models cope. Now we break things into steps because it matches how hu=
mans need to process complex work. The models handle the full journey seaml=
essly, and we humans are the bottleneck (see my note on Software 3.0 [ http=
s://substack.com/redirect/e5e6adbc-1dbc-4f48-9bca-9e75adb32b5e?j=3DeyJ1Ijoi=
NWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Life-work integration is the new normal. These prompts don't distinguish be=
tween "professional" and "personal" because neither do our actual challenge=
s. The same analytical rigor applies whether you're evaluating a business s=
trategy or a life transition.
Context windows enable true partnership. These prompts assume you'll provid=
e rich context=E2=80=94your full situation, constraints, history, hopes. Th=
is wasn't possible before. Now it's how we build genuine AI partnership.
Learning From the Collection
Each prompt teaches patterns you can apply elsewhere. They're like design p=
atterns in software=E2=80=94once you understand the pattern, you can adapt =
it to new situations.
The Energy Audit Protocol (#30) isn't just about personal energy. It's a te=
mplate for any audit process: systematically categorizing inputs and output=
s, identifying hidden drains, designing reallocation strategies. The patter=
n works for time, attention, money, or any scarce resource.
The Meeting Audit & Time Reclaimer (#23) shows how to quantify hidden costs=
 and propose specific alternatives. That pattern applies to any optimizatio=
n challenge where the status quo persists through inertia rather than value=
=2E
The Crisis Communications Command Center (#37) demonstrates real-time decis=
ion support under pressure. The pattern=E2=80=94assess, prioritize, communi=
cate in stages=E2=80=94works for any situation requiring rapid, structured =
response.
These Prompts as Learning Anchors
When you use these prompts, you're not just getting help with specific chal=
lenges. You're learning how prompting is evolving in 2025. Each interaction=
 teaches you:
How to structure complex requests
How to specify outputs that are actually useful
How to build in iteration and refinement
How to extract insights from messy reality
How to move from analysis to action
This is experiential learning. By using these fully-realized examples, you =
develop intuition for what's possible and how to achieve it in your own pro=
mpt design.
Why Now Matters
The timing isn't arbitrary. In 2025, we've reached a convergence point:
Models capable of sophisticated, extended reasoning
Context windows that can hold entire projects
Reliability that makes AI a trusted partner
Integration into every aspect of life and work
And the models are getting better
So this prompting guide aims to set you up for not just the best models out=
 there today, but for ChatGPT-5 as well. We=E2=80=99re skating to where the=
 puck is going.
We're not experimenting anymore. We're implementing. We're not asking "can =
AI help?" We're asking "what's the best way to structure this partnership?"=
 These 39 prompts represent accumulated wisdom about what that partnership =
can look like when it's designed thoughtfully.
Moving Forward
Use these prompts. Study them. Adapt them. But most importantly, understand=
 what they represent: the current state of the art in human-AI collaboratio=
n. Not the end point, but the takeoff point=E2=80=94where we are now. Good =
enough to rely on. Sophisticated enough to handle real complexity. Human en=
ough to be genuine partners in the full spectrum of life's challenges.
The journey continues. These prompts are tools for where we are today, buil=
t on everything we've learned so far, pointing toward what's possible tomor=
row.
