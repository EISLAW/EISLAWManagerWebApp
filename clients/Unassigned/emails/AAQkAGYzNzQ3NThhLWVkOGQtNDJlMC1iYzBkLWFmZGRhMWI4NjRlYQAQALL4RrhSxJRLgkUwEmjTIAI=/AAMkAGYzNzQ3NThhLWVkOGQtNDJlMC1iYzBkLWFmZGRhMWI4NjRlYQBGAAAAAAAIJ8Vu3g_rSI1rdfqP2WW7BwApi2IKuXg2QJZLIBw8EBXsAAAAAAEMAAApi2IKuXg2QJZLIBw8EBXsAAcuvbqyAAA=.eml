tell-my-mom-about-ai

I wrote this in hopes that it helps you in your conversations with friends =
and family in your life who don=E2=80=99t understand AI.=20
One of the things I reflect on a lot in these situations is that human pers=
uasion happens when the mind is open to possibility. When we get into a spa=
ce where we=E2=80=99re able to open ourselves to the chance to discover a s=
olution for ourselves.=20
It doesn=E2=80=99t happen when we say that the other person is wrong, howev=
er tempting that might be.=20
I know most of my writing is for what I=E2=80=99d call the AI-persuaded. He=
ck, you=E2=80=99re reading this because you care about AI.=20
But I bet you have people in your life who don=E2=80=99t get it. Honestly, =
most of the people in my life (if I just count up my circle of ~200 friends=
 and family) probably fall into the slightly-skeptical-to-totally-don=E2=80=
=99t-get-AI camp.=20
And I think this technology is worth getting. It=E2=80=99s worth trying to =
get to a moment of curiosity.
So I wrote this.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Mom,=20
I know it was a little weird to you when I was building computers in high s=
chool.=20
I know you asked me to fix the Pentium, and I know how to navigate weird TV=
 menus you can=E2=80=99t seem to find. I can get the Hulu login to work. An=
d I know why your iPhone is doing that thing where it won=E2=80=99t ring pr=
operly.=20
I know my job is a bit of a mystery. No, I don=E2=80=99t just write code.=
=20
In fact, that=E2=80=99s one of the things that=E2=80=99s changing. Less and=
 less code is getting written by people I work with. At least by hand.
Yes, I know Uncle George showed you the ChatGPT answer where it didn=E2=80=
=99t know who the president currently is. (I=E2=80=99m not telling Mom that=
 this is a tools access issue with the early GPT-4 instance that Uncle Geor=
ge had a few months ago.)
I know, how can the tool be that dumb and still write code.
But, it can Mom. It can.=20
Have you tried it? No? Not on your phone? You don=E2=80=99t want it taking =
your data.
Ok. And you heard it takes the water.=20
Ok.
And the children are going to use it for their homework.
Ok.=20
And they won=E2=80=99t learn anything.=20
Right. Actually, I=E2=80=99m careful about that one, too.
What if I told you a bit of a story, Mom? Would that be ok? Stories are how=
 humans have connected for 200,000 years, so maybe this one will help us co=
nnect, too.
The story begins a long time ago, when we were just figuring out how to get=
 machines to do math. Ada Lovelace. Automatic calculating machines. Machine=
s that could do calculus. I know it wasn=E2=80=99t much of a history you le=
arned, but for the nerds the idea that a machine could automatically, corre=
ctly, calculate answers was the beginning of it all.
That automated correctness is the thread we=E2=80=99ve been following ever =
since, and it=E2=80=99s led us to some surprising places. It=E2=80=99s led =
to ENIAC, a giant computer that filled a room where you had to fight for ti=
me and write your programs incredibly efficiently to make use of every minu=
te on the mainframe. It led to the ENGIMA machine, and to the mathematics t=
hat helped crack the ENIGMA code and win the war for the Allies.
It led to a computer that took us to the moon in the 1960=E2=80=99s. By the=
 way, Mom, did you know that the iPhone in your purse has more power than t=
hat computer? The one Neil Armstrong landed on the moon with? I found that =
such a cool stat when I learned about it.=20
Why am I tell you all this ancient stuff? I know I wasn=E2=80=99t alive for=
 the moon landing and you were, but part of the story here is that we=E2=80=
=99ve been exploring in silicon while you=E2=80=99ve been following some of=
 the news headlines that silicon made possible. So yes, the moon landing wo=
uldn=E2=80=99t have happened without computers.=20
And the 401k that=E2=80=99s allowing you to retire this year=E2=80=94that w=
as basically a computer thing, because silicon valley produced so many incr=
edibly valuable companies based on computers during the 1980=E2=80=99s and =
1990=E2=80=99s.=20
Remember how amazed I was when Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov at chess? That =
was one of the first publicly consumable news items about artificial intell=
igence out there, but we in the computing community had been working on AI =
for a long time.
Not AI you can talk with. That=E2=80=99s more recent. But AI that programs =
itself, to some extend. That reaches its own conclusions independently. Whe=
re we don=E2=80=99t exactly know what will come out.=20
I worked on that a lot at Amazon, Mom. AI that would help make movie recomm=
endations happen. AI that would help pick the right image for the movie. Or=
 that would predict which item would go in which warehouse at Amazon. Even =
then I remember you telling me that was all too complicated and you didn=E2=
=80=99t know about that stuff.
Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s cool about it: it=E2=80=99s actually really e=
asy to illustrate the concept even if we have to have fancy engineers to bu=
ild the system. Yes, really.
Imagine for a second that you have a bowling ball. We=E2=80=99ve gone bowli=
ng together. You know how bad I am at it. Well, let=E2=80=99s imagine that =
the bowling ball is going to get rolled, not down a bowling alley that=E2=
=80=99s nice and straight, but into a mysterious dark room with many valley=
s and peaks.=20
The bowling ball=E2=80=99s job is to find the very lowest valley in the roo=
m.=20
That=E2=80=99s it. That=E2=80=99s how AI works Mom! It is a function to fin=
d probability across a diverse mathematical landscape. We can visualize tha=
t space as a map of peaks and valleys. And it turns out machines are very g=
ood at optimizing for a max probability in that space. Here=E2=80=99s what =
it looks like:
I can see your eyes glazing over, so I=E2=80=99ll remind you this is the bo=
wling ball finding the lowest valley in our imaginary room again. Just let =
that bowling ball roll around a bit. A lot of our jobs in tech now involve =
preparing these landscapes, framing these problems, figuring out what kind =
of problem it is, what metaphorical bowling ball works in this situation. A=
nd then how to package up the result we find in a way that=E2=80=99s useful=
=2E
And that=E2=80=99s a bit of where the energy piece comes in. As you can ima=
gine, it takes the computer a fair bit of time to sort of roll the bowling =
ball through the whole landscape and find the optimal point. It takes energ=
y.=20
And I know it=E2=80=99s tempting to think it=E2=80=99s a waste. Like, why c=
an=E2=80=99t I just have a team that hand-picks those movie images? What ab=
out jobs for designers? Isn=E2=80=99t it good enough to just have the items=
 in a warehouse and ship them? Why does it have to be the optimal warehouse=
?
Well, Mom, you taught me that working hard really matters. And one of the t=
hings I=E2=80=99ve discovered by working hard is that correctness really ma=
tters at most things in life, and it doesn=E2=80=99t come easy.
In this case, that shows up in a couple ways. First, it turns out getting t=
he answer exactly right (getting the bowling ball to the true maximum in th=
e distribution) yields a way better answer than just a mostly right human g=
uess. And that makes a difference we can measure in human experience. Like,=
 people disproportionately choose to watch movies they prefer when we get t=
he title image exactly right, because it makes the choice easier for them. =
And sure, that one seems frivolous. But getting that gift for Mother=E2=80=
=99s Day? That was possible overnight because of these AI algorithms too.
And what=E2=80=99s interesting about correctness is that it=E2=80=99s often=
 so correct we can measure real savings vs. just our guess solution before.=
 So for instance, getting your Mother=E2=80=99s Day closer to you made it p=
ossible to ship overnight efficiently, but that also meant fewer carbon emi=
ssions. Now multiple that times ten million orders.
Sure, none of this is the AI you can talk with. I=E2=80=99m coming to that =
part.=20
It turns out that the same bowling ball thing works for human language, too=
=2E We just had to have a computer and=20=
data set big enough to do it. And we h=
ad to figure out the exact method that would work to help the computer lear=
n language. It=E2=80=99s called the Transformer, and I know it=E2=80=99s no=
t the movie. It=E2=80=99s basically a special method we=E2=80=99ve invented=
 of teaching a computer language space. Any language in the world, as long =
as we have a lot of it. It works by chopping up a sentence into little bits=
, and learning extensively about how humans fit those bits together, and th=
en reproducing human-like sentences that match those underlying patterns we=
 use when we talk and write.
And you know how it does that? With that same sort of bowling ball idea. It=
 picks the most probable next token (or word bit) out of a gigantic probabi=
lity landscape. And does that over and over again. And I wouldn=E2=80=99t t=
hink it would work either, but it turns out human language has such recogni=
zable patterns that it really does.
And so when Uncle George asks it about the current president, it is just go=
ing through and trying to find the correct word bit to put down, piece by p=
iece, until it gives him a sentence back. And if it=E2=80=99s the wrong sen=
tence, frankly the fact that it=E2=80=99s a sentence is still kind of a mir=
acle. And now these days we=E2=80=99ve given those tools internet access, s=
o they can get the right answer to the president question just about every =
time.
And you know what=E2=80=99s cool? It turns out most of our civilization was=
 built on language after all. So this one tiny part of AI has become sudden=
ly the most important thing in the world. Because language is the key to ju=
st about everything. Language is how we think. Language is how we communica=
te. Language is how we decide. All that stuff is now accessible to computer=
s, because they speak our language too.
I know, it=E2=80=99s scary. And yes, it does take a lot of energy. But I=E2=
=80=99ll let you in on a secret: humans are not particularly cheap to run e=
ither. Yes, that=E2=80=99s a very nerdy thing to say. But I want you to ima=
gine something with me for a second. This is based on a real story from my =
office. Let=E2=80=99s say one of my colleagues figured out how to get the A=
I (Deep Research, for those nerds reading along) to do three months=E2=80=
=99 worth of work for him on a complicated pricing problem.=20
Yes, Mom, we have pricing problems that are that complicated. In this case =
it was a multi-hundred million dollar problem around moving to a multi-clou=
d computing footprint, and I think it=E2=80=99s probably easiest to leave t=
he details out on that. The point was it was a really really complicated pr=
oblem, and ChatGPT helped him to save three months of work on a six month p=
roblem.=20
How much energy would three months of work have cost? Like, what if we aske=
d ourselves how much energy all those breakfasts and workouts and lunches a=
nd dinners and all the stuff that we consume to be human for three months c=
ost? Because that AI got it done in 30 minutes. Or two hundredths of 1 perc=
ent of the time it would have taken the human.=20
So yes, AI can take energy. But it=E2=80=99s incredibly efficient at what i=
t does. And humans have always consumed energy to be prosperous. A lot of o=
ur history as a species is a history of figuring out how to convert energy =
into prosperity (Mom, I might get you Vaclav Smil [ https://substack.com/re=

And yes, Mom, he still has a job. And yes, you could argue his living is a =
sunk cost. But you could argue the AI getting set up is a sunk cost too, ri=
ght? These things need to cut both ways.
The point is we=E2=80=99ve come a pretty long way from ENIAC. The computers=
 can now talk to us in our language. Which means they can think like us (al=
though weirdly not, in certain ways). They can help us make decisions. They=
 can help us reason.=20
And whatever Uncle George says, it=E2=80=99s a really big deal Mom. Your gr=
andkids are going to have their whole lives shaped by how their interact wi=
th this AI. It=E2=80=99s my job as Dad [ https://substack.com/redirect/11bf=

o use it or put it on your phone, I=
 wanted you to know about it, because it=E2=80=99s going to shape their who=
le world.
Yes Mom, it=E2=80=99s probably bigger than the internet. With the internet,=
 we figured out how billions of us could interact in one big messy complica=
ted space. And that idea generated countless new relationships, endless con=
versation, new modes of language, lots of very bad choices, and most of the=
 world=E2=80=99s most valuable companies. It was one idea that had lots of =
unforeseen consequences: positive and negative.
Now, let=E2=80=99s imagine it=E2=80=99s 1995 again. That=E2=80=99s where we=
 are with AI.=20
It=E2=80=99s all still ahead of us, Mom. I=E2=80=99m still the nerdy little=
 kid at heart, listening for that that internet connection ping [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/e9719f2c-631d-47e7-8650-8a8609d96501?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=

e and could use Netscape Navigator. Except now it=E2=80=99s AI, and I=E2=80=
=99m learning how to think with a piece of silicon that is (itself) learnin=
g to think.=20
And that=E2=80=99s kind of why this is bigger than the internet. Before it =
was all of our human brains getting linked by wire. Now it=E2=80=99s that w=
e=E2=80=99ve taught silicon chips how to (more or less) think and speak, an=
d suddenly it=E2=80=99s not just human brains anymore. It=E2=80=99s like al=
l of us have 100x the brains in our pocket, and those brains are getting be=
tter all the time.
Yep, there=E2=80=99s a lot of people saying this will end in disaster for u=
s. I know, that Mom. But I gotta say, this feels less risky to me than lite=
rally making atomic bombs and hoping we all don=E2=80=99t misuse them as a =
species. At least with ChatGPT we know there are lots of really positive us=
es for it right now. And the evidence we have so far suggests that the inte=
lligence of the machine is frankly more consistently ethical [ https://subs=

=20
Is it taking all the jobs? Well, no. That=E2=80=99s a really common misconc=
eption though.
We definitely had a bubble burst in my industry when interest raise rose in=
 2022. You remember I lost my job, Mom. A lot of us did. Well, that had not=
hing to do with AI, but a lot of people are confused about that.
And it=E2=80=99s certainly true that CEOs are insisting that people in my i=
ndustry learn and use AI [ https://substack.com/redirect/472f5eea-8eaf-42b4=

ndkids will be expected to just know this stuff. And people who don=E2=80=
=99t use AI are probably going to regret that choice, since they won=E2=80=
=99t be as competitive [ https://substack.com/redirect/18f2e572-c4fa-4d1c-9=

AjMRMPOw0 ]. That=E2=80=99s a study by the St. Louis branch of the Federal =
Reserve I linked there, and it calls out that workers who use AI tend to be=
 ~33% more productive.
As someone who uses AI all the time, Mom, I=E2=80=99d say that under-estima=
tes the impact. I=E2=80=99m probably 2-3x more effective now than I was bef=
ore ChatGPT. And the thing is, that multiple keeps growing. Adding this new=
 o3 model by itself probably gave me another multiple.
So that=E2=80=99s why I yak on and on about AI, Mom! We=E2=80=99ve taught t=
he rocks to think, they=E2=80=99re getting smarter faster, and it is changi=
ng absolutely everything. You might think it=E2=80=99s only about tech, but=
 we all need medicine, and this kind of AI is changing medicine really fast=
=2E In fact, AI designed synthetic DNA=20=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/45968=

gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]just this week, and scientists are already workin=
g out ways to use it for disease prevention and cure. There=E2=80=99s going=
 to be AI-designed drugs on our shelves in the next year or two, and we=E2=
=80=99ll all be better off for it. AI can drive cars now, and if we let AI =
drive cars everywhere in America we=E2=80=99d save something like 40k lives=
 a year.
And we=E2=80=99re just getting started. I know Uncle George thinks AI is a =
mentally defective parrot. But there=E2=80=99s a lot of evidence to show th=
at innovative ideas have a sharp exponential curve tied (roughly) to IQ. Ri=
ght now, the AI in my pocket is a really smart grad student in a lot of way=
s, and Einstein in a few ways (like image recognition).=20
But in the next year or two we=E2=80=99re going to cross over into super hu=
man IQ, and the number of novel ideas from AI is likely to skyrocket. This =
is related to Lotka=E2=80=99s Law [ https://substack.com/redirect/48d01e9f-=

BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], which predicts the publication by author in a given=
 field. Essentially, the really really smart authors in a field publish way=
 way more novel and interesting papers than everyone else. And there=E2=80=
=99s no reason to suspect AI will work any differently.An
And Mom, we=E2=80=99re going to hit that vertical part of the curve in the =
next 12-18 months. We=E2=80=99re already at the bendy part. We see novel st=
uff.=20
I know. It=E2=80=99s hard to keep track. Uncle George was using an old vers=
ion of ChatGPT, and most people have a hard time tracking how fast these th=
ings are getting smarter. Yes, it can feel a bit scary. I think the unknown=
 is often that way, right? I try and stay brave for the kids. This is reall=
y going to be their adventure, and I want them to know that Dad sent them o=
ff with bright hearts and clear minds.
And finally, Mom, about that water thing: most people who think ChatGPT suc=
ks up a lot of energy and water are picking only pieces of the story they w=
ant to tell. Did you take a hot shower this morning? That consumes thousand=
s of times more energy than a ChatGPT query. An hour of streaming Netflix i=
s worth hundreds of ChatGPT queries in terms of energy (you can read more o=
n that here [ https://substack.com/redirect/cf292aee-e0ad-48e6-944b-d9d0bb9=

=2E=20
Look, the ChatGPT energy consumption on this chart is so small you can=E2=
=80=99t even see it compared to everyday activities.
Yep, it=E2=80=99s so tiny it=E2=80=99s nearly impossible to see, so I made =
it more visible on this log scale chart. Remember, this is the exact same i=
nformation, but each scale bar is 10x the previous one so you can see tiny =
numbers better.
By the way, this is a good reminder to always look at the Y axis on a graph=
! If you didn=E2=80=99t understand this was a log chart, this one would eas=
ily make you think that ChatGPT was comparable to something like the energy=
 needed to bake a cake or to Dad watching an hour of NFL on the big screen.=
 It=E2=80=99s not.
And as for water: the problem is not AI per se. It=E2=80=99s actually that =
we run a lot of computers now in very large data centers that get very hot.=
 And water is really good at cooling stuff. So we need to cool those data c=
enters and water is an efficient way to do that (more efficient than forced=
 air). And yes, ChatGPT is causing us to build more data centers, so in tha=
t sense there=E2=80=99s water use involved. And we have to be really carefu=
l with that water, because it has to be really clean to run through the ser=
vers (like the diagram below) and not corrode them:
So you might think it makes sense to worry! All that clean water has to com=
e from somewhere, right?
But all of the major players in the space (Google, AWS, Microsoft, Meta) ha=
ve pledged to be water positive by 2030, which means they will return more =
water to the community than they consume. And these big players have also l=
aunched (or are launching) data centers that dramatically reduce potable wa=
ter usage by using grey water or recycling the water they use in their data=
 centers to reduce municipal water consumption. So is water being consumed?=
 Yes. But like most technical problems where we turn a lot of focused human=
 attention, we=E2=80=99re figuring it out pretty quickly. You can read more=
 about all the water stuff and how it works in data centers here [ https://=
substack.com/redirect/22f6097d-d146-4940-974f-38e0f7f9c5e4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWti=

Water positive might be a confusing topic, so I=E2=80=99ve included an expl=
anation from AWS in that article down here:
Ok, Mom, I think I=E2=80=99ve written long enough. Probably time to go out =
and get you your flowers for Mother=E2=80=99s day and stop yakking on about=
 AI! I hope this letter has helped you get a little bit of a sense of the w=
orld I=E2=80=99m working in, and the one in which your grandchildren will l=
ive.=20
I hope you understand a little bit of why I=E2=80=99m excited about AI and =
I hope you get a sense of what what this kind of AI might mean for our futu=
re. I hope you dare to imagine a bit, and if you want to try ChatGPT I=E2=
=80=99m happy to get it installed on your phone for you. I=E2=80=99m sure w=
e could brainstorm some questions you could ask it, and yes I=E2=80=99ll ma=
ke sure you get the updated version (not the old one Uncle George uses).
Maybe you could ask it about your garden plan this year! I used it to help =
me figure out my tomato planting configuration.
And no matter what, I=E2=80=99ll be your loving son=E2=80=A6
You get the idea. It=E2=80=99s all about story. I want to tell my Mom (and =
others in my life) an actual story about AI that helps them get into a spac=
e of imagination. That helps them to start to explore the possibility that =
AI could be a solution for something.=20
I tried to weave in all the facts that I have trouble communicating directl=
y in a more narrative, story-driven style. Because if I=E2=80=99d started b=
y saying =E2=80=9Cno, AI energy consumption is an awful myth=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94well, no one would listen would they?
So pick and choose, share pieces of this with someone in your life who need=
s to hear about AI! And even if you don=E2=80=99t, I hope this helps inform=
 your conversations about AI with those in your life who are skeptical or j=
ust plain confused=E2=80=A6

nt-size: 16px;">That automated correctness is the thread we=E2=80=99ve been=
 following ever since, and it=E2=80=99s led us to some surprising places. I=
t=E2=80=99s led to ENIAC, a giant computer that filled a room where you had=
 to fight for time and write your programs incredibly efficiently to make u=
se of every minute on the mainframe. It led to the ENGIMA machine, and to t=

lies.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=
6px;font-size: 16px;">It led to a computer that took us to the moon in the =
1960=E2=80=99s. By the way, Mom, did you know that the iPhone in your purse=
 has more power than that computer? The one Neil Armstrong landed on the mo=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

ve for the moon landing and you were, but part of the story here is that we=
=E2=80=99ve been exploring in silicon while you=E2=80=99ve been following s=
ome of the news headlines that silicon made possible. So yes, the moon land=
ing wouldn=E2=80=99t have happened without computers. </p><p style=3D"margi=

the bowling ball is going to get rolled, not down a bowling alley that=E2=

=E2=80=99s how AI works Mom! It is a function to find probability across a =
diverse mathematical landscape. We can visualize that space as a map of pea=

 26px;font-size: 16px;">I can see your eyes glazing over, so I=E2=80=99ll r=
emind you this is the bowling ball finding the lowest valley in our imagina=
ry room again. Just let that bowling ball roll around a bit. A lot of our j=
obs in tech now involve preparing these landscapes, framing these problems,=
 figuring out what kind of problem it is, what metaphorical bowling ball wo=
rks in this situation. And then how to package up the result we find in a w=
ay that=E2=80=99s useful.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And that=E2=80=99s a bit of where=
 the energy piece comes in. As you can imagine, it takes the computer a fai=
r bit of time to sort of roll the bowling ball through the whole landscape =
and find the optimal point. It takes energy. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And I know it=
=E2=80=99s tempting to think it=E2=80=99s a waste. Like, why can=E2=80=99t =
I just have a team that hand-picks those movie images? What about jobs for =
designers? Isn=E2=80=99t it good enough to just have the items in a warehou=
se and ship them? Why does it have to be the optimal warehouse?</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Well, Mom, you taught me that working hard really matters. And one of =
the things I=E2=80=99ve discovered by working hard is that correctness real=
ly matters at most things in life, and it doesn=E2=80=99t come easy.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">In this case, that shows up in a couple ways. First, it turns out=
 getting the answer exactly right (getting the bowling ball to the true max=
imum in the distribution) yields a way better answer than just a mostly rig=
ht human guess. And that makes a difference we can measure in human experie=
nce. Like, people disproportionately choose to watch movies they prefer whe=
n we get the title image exactly right, because it makes the choice easier =
for them. And sure, that one seems frivolous. But getting that gift for Mot=
her=E2=80=99s Day? That was possible overnight because of these AI algorith=
ms too.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">And what=E2=80=99s interesting about correctness is=
 that it=E2=80=99s often so correct we can measure real savings vs. just ou=
r guess solution before. So for instance, getting your Mother=E2=80=99s Day=
 closer to you made it possible to ship overnight efficiently, but that als=
o meant fewer carbon emissions. Now multiple that times ten million orders.=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">Sure, none of this is the AI you can talk with. I=E2=80=99=
m coming to that part. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It turns out that the same bowling =
ball thing works for human language, too. We just had to have a computer an=
d data set big enough to do it. And we had to figure out the exact method t=
hat would work to help the computer learn language. It=E2=80=99s called the=
 Transformer, and I know it=E2=80=99s not the movie. It=E2=80=99s basically=
 a special method we=E2=80=99ve invented of teaching a computer language sp=
ace. Any language in the world, as long as we have a lot of it. It works by=
 chopping up a sentence into little bits, and learning extensively about ho=
w humans fit those bits together, and then reproducing human-like sentences=
 that match those underlying patterns we use when we talk and write.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">And you know how it does that? With that same sort of bowling bal=
l idea. It picks the most probable next token (or word bit) out of a gigant=
ic probability landscape. And does that over and over again. And I wouldn=
=E2=80=99t think it would work either, but it turns out human language has =
such recognizable patterns that it really does.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And so when=
 Uncle George asks it about the current president, it is just going through=
 and trying to find the correct word bit to put down, piece by piece, until=
 it gives him a sentence back. And if it=E2=80=99s the wrong sentence, fran=
kly the fact that it=E2=80=99s a sentence is still kind of a miracle. And n=
ow these days we=E2=80=99ve given those tools internet access, so they can =
get the right answer to the president question just about every time.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">And you know what=E2=80=99s cool? It turns out most of our civil=
ization was built on language after all. So this one tiny part of AI has be=
come suddenly the most important thing in the world. Because language is th=
e key to just about everything. Language is how we think. Language is how w=
e communicate. Language is how we decide. All that stuff is now accessible =
to computers, because they speak our language too.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=

office. Let=E2=80=99s say one of my colleagues figured out how to get the A=

ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Yes, Mom, we have pricing problems that are th=
at complicated. In this case it was a multi-hundred million dollar problem =
around moving to a multi-cloud computing footprint, and I think it=E2=80=99=
s probably easiest to leave the details out on that. The point was it was a=
 really really complicated problem, and ChatGPT helped him to save three mo=
nths of work on a six month problem. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">How much energy would=
 three months of work have cost? Like, what if we asked ourselves how much =
energy all those breakfasts and workouts and lunches and dinners and all th=
e stuff that we consume to be human for three months cost? Because that AI =
got it done in 30 minutes. Or two hundredths of 1 percent of the time it wo=
uld have taken the human. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

ers to reduce municipal water consumption. So is water being consumed? Yes.=
