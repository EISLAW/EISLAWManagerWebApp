Wednesday Sept. 17: we could see the first major rate cut in 4 years.
Join Mark and Andrew at 1:45 p.m. to live react to Powell's speech and
trade the market aftermath --> ADD TO CALENDAR HERE

 Too often, I watch traders =E2=80=9Cdumb down=E2=80=9D opportunities.

They say things like:

_My readers will never understand this._

_I can=E2=80=99t say that - that=E2=80=99s way too complicated._

Heck, ten years ago=E2=80=A6 they convinced me they were right. I drank the
Kool Aid. I wrote to an eighth grade reading level, because I was told
that was most approachable, and to never write anything more
complicated than that.

Then the market changed.

COVID came - 0DTE options came - and for the first time, THE BEST
OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE MARKET WERE MORE =E2=80=9CCOMPLICATED=E2=80=
=9D
THAN AN 8TH GRADE READING LEVEL.

They weren=E2=80=99t inexplicable, but it took time and brainpower to break
down the market=E2=80=99s best opportunities into a framework anyone could
understand. Time most people didn=E2=80=99t want to take. I decided we
should try it.=C2=A0

After all, it was the best opportunity across the entire market and
not only did our audience deserve to know that UP FRONT, it was
actually our responsibility as trading mentors they put their trust in
to bring the opportunity to them.

They told me I was crazy; that it=E2=80=99d never work.

I didn=E2=80=99t care.

In 2022, Mark and I launched =E2=80=9CExpiration Trader,=E2=80=9D Mark=E2=
=80=99s
original trading service built to profit off the insane volume moving
into same-day, zero days to expiration (=E2=80=9C0DTE=E2=80=9D) options, us=
ing the
Cash Zone strategy he still uses today.

During the live launch, we didn=E2=80=99t hide the fact these were butterfly
trades. We didn=E2=80=99t omit it because it was =E2=80=9Ctoo hard=E2=80=9D=
 or =E2=80=9Ctoo
scary=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cimpossible.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0

INSTEAD, WE DID SOMETHING WILD. WE WERE HONEST.

WE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHY WE MADE THAT DECISION: TO LOWER THE COST OF
THE TRADES FROM $500-600 TO AROUND $100.

We didn=E2=80=99t pull the wool over your eyes.=C2=A0

We showed you our thinking and we trusted you to listen and
understand.

That product went on to be one of the most successful we ever
launched, with one of the biggest readerships we=E2=80=99d ever had.

WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS? I=E2=80=99M NOT JUST BEING SENTIMENTAL=E2=80=A6=
=C2=A0

Now, I take it personally when I see =E2=80=9Cdumbed down=E2=80=9D rhetoric.
It=E2=80=99s all around us. CNBC or Bloomberg just spinning up and
regurgitating sound byte after sound byte, with no actual interest in
HELPING you, just interest in promoting views.

Oddly, I=E2=80=99m THANKFUL they don=E2=80=99t do this well.

It=E2=80=99s created a massive opportunity for us at Option Pit to service
the needs they DON=E2=80=99T meet, and it=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99m e=
xtremely
passionate about. It=E2=80=99s why I work at Option Pit, it=E2=80=99s why I=
 only
work with professional traders, and it=E2=80=99s why we created CRT.

This brings us to today.

At 2pm this afternoon, the Federal Reserve will announce their
decision on rates: to cut or not to cut. THE LIKELIHOOD THEY _WILL_
CUT IS AT 96%, WHICH I=E2=80=99M SURE YOU=E2=80=99VE SEEN IF YOU=E2=80=99RE=
 A MEMBER OF
PLANET EARTH.

THAT ISN=E2=80=99T NEWS.

I=E2=80=99m going to spend the next few paragraphs telling you the REAL
STORY, the MOST IMPORTANT STORY that you understand about what this
Fed Fund Rate cut means for you for the next 6, 9, 12 months and
beyond.=C2=A0

This isn=E2=80=99t a story ANYONE ELSE trusts you to understand.=C2=A0

So=E2=80=A6 they won=E2=80=99t tell you, but we will.

There=E2=80=99s a seismic shift that=E2=80=99s going to happen under our fe=
et, and
today at 2pm, the first domino will fall.

THE UNTOLD STORY YOU NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW

TODAY AT 2PM:
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/83e70064f4d14567af73aa7492301c0d-982a1d=
9f3e004fdf8dacd9220d553af7/57]

Everyone knows the Fed will cut rates today. But what does that really
mean?

The Fed can only directly change one rate: THE FED FUND RATE. It is an
interest rate, but it=E2=80=99s not the one that affects your mortgage. The
Fed Fund Rate dictates how much it costs for a bank to borrow money.=C2=A0

And immediately, it only affects three things:

 	* Short term borrowing rates for big companies like GE or IBM
 	* It can make the =E2=80=9Ccost=E2=80=9D of trading for firms that borrow=
 stock
either more or less expensive (cut =3D less, raise =3D more)
 	* It changes overall market liquidity, or the amount of money
sloshing around in the market (cut =3D more liquidity, raise =3D less
liquidity)

That=E2=80=99s it.

Now, the reason everyone and their mother talks about the Fed and Fed
Fund Rates is because they have the ability to create a domino effect
that influences much more than just the 3 items above.

When the Fed lowers rates just enough at just the right time (as we
anticipate they will this afternoon)...

They can cause the first domino to fall in a series that months from
now can influence the market broadly, including affecting the interest
rate you have on your mortgage.

In fact, we=E2=80=99re already seeing this effect now, even before the rate
cut has taken place because people are just THAT SURE it=E2=80=99s going to
happen.

I=E2=80=99m talking about the .8% drop in mortgage rates in the last two
weeks.

That=E2=80=99s not a coincidence. That=E2=80=99s the dominoes falling early=
 in
anticipation of the Fed Fund Rate cut at 2pm today.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL GOV=E2=80=99T & FEDERAL RESERVE
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/83e70064f4d14567af73aa7492301c0d-982a1d=
9f3e004fdf8dacd9220d553af7/57]

There are two =E2=80=9Cforces=E2=80=9D at play when it comes to rates and
influencing market trends, and they both want something different.

 	* The Federal Government wants long term rates (like your mortgage)
to go down, but they also want to keep spending money (this is going
to be important in a minute)
 	* The Federal Reserve will cut short term rates which eventually
can/will affect long term rates

Now=E2=80=A6

Here=E2=80=99s where it gets really fun (you=E2=80=99re having fun, right?!=
).

The issue the Fed has is the government won=E2=80=99t stop spending money.
As they drive us further and further into debt, THEY INCREASE
INFLATION.

To the Fed, inflation is bad. Inflation kills markets. Inflation is
bad for the economy.

So=E2=80=A6 what can the Fed do if the government wants lower rates, but
isn=E2=80=99t willing to stop spending and decrease inflation by turning off
the tap?

They LOWER SHORT TERM RATES (via the Fed Fund Rate), which is what
they=E2=80=99re going to do at 2pm today =E2=86=92

In doing so, they create a market environment where companies are
incentivized to hire, banks to loan money, etc. =E2=80=A6 things that grow
the economy and will LOWER LONG TERM RATES =E2=86=92=C2=A0

They call in reinforcements: the Fed Twist.

THE =E2=80=9CFED TWIST=E2=80=9D CURVEBALL
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/83e70064f4d14567af73aa7492301c0d-982a1d=
9f3e004fdf8dacd9220d553af7/57]

This is the story no one will tell you. But as traders, this is
something you can and must understand so that you can stay ahead of
this opportunity, which we=E2=80=99re going to be talking about for the next
year here at Option Pit.

Right now, there=E2=80=99s an imbalance in the bond market.

BONDS ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE SHORT TERM AND REALLY CHEAP LONG TERM.

That sounds bad, but for the Fed=E2=80=A6 It's good. This means they can do
a =E2=80=9CFed Twist=E2=80=9D... they SELL short term rates that are expens=
ive and
BUY long term rates that are cheap. They take advantage of bond
arbitrage so THAT THEY CAN BASICALLY FORCE LONG TERM RATES LOWER.

Now, this isn=E2=80=99t a FOREVER fix.=C2=A0

If the Fed stopped selling short term rates and buying long term
rates, and the gov=E2=80=99t kept spending like a drunken sailor=E2=80=A6 l=
ong
term rates would spike back up. But for a time, they can use this to
manipulate long term rates lower.

We know this because it=E2=80=99s happened before.

From 2009 to 2011, the Fed had the exact same goal of lowering long
term rates. Over two and a half years, several rate cuts, and over $2
trillion in bonds bought/sold in a Fed Twist, they successfully
lowered rates from 5.38% to 3.7%.

MARK=E2=80=99S BIG PREDICTION
[https://click.op.optionpit.com/t/c/83e70064f4d14567af73aa7492301c0d-982a1d=
9f3e004fdf8dacd9220d553af7/57]

Big Takeaway #1 is=E2=80=A6 this is NOT a permanent solution. As an American
citizen, you should know that.

Big Takeaway #2 is what I=E2=80=99ve been building towards, and this is SO
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I CANNOT OVERSTATE IT.

BOTH THE DOW AND THE RUSSELL 2000 ARE GOING TO OUTPACE THE S&P 500
OVER THE NEXT 3 MONTHS AS THE MARKET FULLY RESETS EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT
RATES WILL BE MOVING FORWARD.=C2=A0 =C2=A0

Dow Companies are industrials. They use short term borrowing (less
than a year) all the time to spur growth, primarily=C2=A0 to match
outflows of cash with inflows of payments.=C2=A0

Think about it like this: They need to build the tractor (outflow)=C2=A0
before they can sell it (inflow). THIS BORROWING IS GOING TO GET MUCH
CHEAPER, SO THEY=E2=80=99LL DO IT MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY AND THEY WILL GROW IN
VALUE.=C2=A0

The Russell 2000 is a touch different. These companies use the same
borrowing tactics as industrials, but they carry actual debt.=C2=A0
Russell companies tend to be smaller and newer and need to borrow
money from capital markets to get their businesses off the ground.=C2=A0
They often have higher debt to equity ratios than Industrials because
of their smaller size. If their long term borrowing costs fall (as
they will with a rate cut), they make more money, which in turn
increases their P&L and their entire balance sheet.=C2=A0 THE RUSSELL 2000
-=C2=A0 MORE THAN ANY OTHER INDEX - BENEFITS FROM FALLING RATES.=C2=A0

During Covid when rates went to zero, we saw the IWM (the Russell 2000
ETF) rally from $97 dollars to $234 dollars in 11 months at a 142
percent gain=E2=80=A6.
[fomc]

Currently, IWM happens to be the only index NOT having hit a new all
time high in 2025=E2=80=A6this is about to change.

Over the next few weeks, we=E2=80=99ll be talking more about the specific
opportunities at hand=E2=80=A6

When we plan to trade the Russell and the DOW, and the cheap options
opportunities that will unfold over the next months.=C2=A0

Stay tuned.

SINGLE ONE. HSELNER@OPTIONPIT.COM=20

h different. These companies use the same borrowing tactics as industrials,=
 but they carry actual debt.&nbsp; Russell companies tend to be smaller and=
 newer and need to borrow money from capital markets to get their businesse=
s off the ground.&nbsp; They often have higher debt to equity ratios than I=
ndustrials because of their smaller size. If their long term borrowing cost=
s fall (as they will with a rate cut), they make more money, which in turn =
increases their P&amp;L and their entire balance sheet.</span><strong style=
