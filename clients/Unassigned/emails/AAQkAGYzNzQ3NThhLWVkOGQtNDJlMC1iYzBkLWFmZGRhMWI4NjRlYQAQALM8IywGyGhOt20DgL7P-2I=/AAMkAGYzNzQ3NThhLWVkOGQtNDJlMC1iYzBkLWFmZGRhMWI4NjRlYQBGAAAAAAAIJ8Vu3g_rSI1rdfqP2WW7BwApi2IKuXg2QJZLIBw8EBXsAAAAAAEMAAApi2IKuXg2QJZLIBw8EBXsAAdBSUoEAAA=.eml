RUSSIA’S CALCULATED SILENCE ON THE INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT [3]
THE KREMLIN IS IN NO POSITION TO ALIENATE ANY OF ITS FEW REMAINING ALLIES.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
Last week, the special assistant to Pakistan’s prime minister arrived in Moscow to discuss his country’s recent military skirmish with India and appeal to Russia’s leadership for help reducing
tensions. A few days earlier, an Indian delegation in Moscow accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism and urged Russia to support India’s counterterrorism efforts. But although Russia
expressed its readiness to mediate the dispute just a month earlier, Moscow has since remained noncommittal. Caught between two important partners, Russia is wary of jeopardizing financial, trade and
military ties with either India or Pakistan, particularly as Western governments continue to try to isolate it through sanctions.
Acting as a peacemaker – especially between two nuclear powers – could boost the Kremlin’s global standing and raise the appeal of membership in non-Western regional organizations. India,
Pakistan and Russia are all members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and last year Islamabad expressed its desire to join the other two in the BRICS grouping. Strengthening these
organizations would dilute the influence of Western countries, particularly the U.S., in this part of the world and bring Russia and the Global South closer.
Moscow has played peacemaker in this region in the past. The Soviet Union helped broker the 1966 Tashkent Declaration between India and Pakistan. However, though the deal established peace following
the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, it did not resolve the Kashmir dispute. The continued conflict over the disputed region effectively ended the Soviets' diplomatic efforts. Russia does not want to
participate in initiatives for which success is questionable, since failed peace deals could discredit it as a global mediator. Moreover, amid sanctions and the Russia-Ukraine war, sustaining trade
ties takes precedence over building Moscow's credentials as a broker, and the risks of offending either India or Pakistan are too great.
Were it to get more involved, Moscow may lean toward New Delhi. Since Soviet times, India has been portrayed in Russian political culture as a friendly partner. The two countries maintain formal
agreements on counterterrorism cooperation, including joint efforts within the BRICS and the SCO’s regional counterterrorism center. India is also a vital customer for Russia’s oil producers and
defense companies. Its purchases of Russian crude oil have surged tenfold over the past three years, reaching an all-time high in March. Long-term deals, such as Rosneft’s 10-year agreement with
India’s Reliance for 500,000 barrels of crude per day, provide critical revenue for Moscow. India also invests heavily in Russia’s fuel and energy sector and has been offered a stake in the
all-important Vostok Oil project. Additionally, New Delhi is a significant buyer of Russian S-400 air defense systems. The two countries also co-developed BrahMos missiles, which performed well in
India’s recent clash with Pakistan, prompting hopes in Moscow for expanded military cooperation – even as India has recently turned to Western suppliers for military transport and patrol aircraft,
Rafale fighters and Apache attack helicopters.
But however important India is for the Kremlin, Russia is in no position to alienate its few remaining allies – particularly one like Pakistan, a rare partner interested in deepening cooperation
with Russia despite sanctions. Historically, Russia-Pakistan relations were fraught, strained first by Islamabad’s support for anti-Soviet mujahideen in Afghanistan and later by Moscow’s alignment
with New Delhi. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin even ruled out military-technical cooperation with Pakistan, citing Indian objections. Things began to change a few years later as Pakistan
considered joining the SCO (which it finally did in 2017) and working with Russia and others against terrorism. Always mindful of security threats in Central Asia, Moscow offered Islamabad its support
against the Taliban. In 2014, Russia lifted its arms embargo on Pakistan and signed some military-technical cooperation agreements. Since 2016, they have regularly conducted joint military drills,
most recently in October 2024, and in March their navies held joint exercises in the Arabian Sea.
Economic ties are also growing as Moscow seeks alternative trade partners in the East. In 2015, a year after Russia’s initial limited incursion into eastern Ukraine and Crimea and the imposition of
modest Western sanctions, Russia and Pakistan signed a deal to build a north-south gas pipeline from Karachi to Lahore. In 2023, they inked a long-term oil supply agreement, and within a few years,
Pakistan expects Russian oil to meet up to 30 percent of its annual demand. Although sanctions have restricted Russia’s ability to settle trade, Pakistan has not been deterred, instead resorting to
bartering or the Chinese yuan to keep up economic exchange with Russia. In October, Moscow hosted the first Russia-Pakistan investment forum, drawing more than 70 Pakistani business leaders and more
than 100 Russian firms.

Pakistan’s geography enhances its appeal to Russia. Located at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East, its trade corridors and ports are strategically valuable. The potential
inclusion of Afghanistan – aided by Russia’s removal of the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and China’s facilitation of better Pakistan-Afghanistan diplomatic ties – greatly
increases the appeal of an economic corridor from Russia and China to South Asia and the Indian Ocean. In April, Russia and Uzbekistan advanced the Trans-Afghan Railway project, which will link
Central Asia with South Asia through Afghanistan.

Speaking on the 25th anniversary of strategic relations between Russia and India, Russia’s ambassador to India emphasized trust as the cornerstone of bilateral relations. But trust, he warned, can
be destroyed in a single moment. This is the essence of Moscow’s dilemma. India – whose trade with Russia far surpasses Pakistan’s – opposes third-party mediation with Pakistan. Instead, it
expects Russia to endorse its counterterrorism operations, including against targets inside Pakistan. Conversely, Islamabad welcomes Moscow’s mediation and offers untapped economic opportunities.
For now, the Kremlin is in a holding pattern, calculating the cost of action versus inaction. With strategic influence and energy and defense exports on the line, Moscow cannot afford to make a wrong
move.

													<p class=3D"subtitle" style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#4d4d4e;=
margin:1em 0;font-weight:200;font-style: italic;font-size:15px">
														</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last week, the spe=
cial assistant to Pakistan=E2=80=99s prime minister arrived in Moscow to di=
scuss his country=E2=80=99s recent military skirmish with India and appeal =
to Russia=E2=80=99s leadership for help reducing tensions. A few days earli=
er, an Indian delegation in Moscow accused Pakistan of supporting cross-bor=
der terrorism and urged Russia to support India=E2=80=99s counterterrorism =
efforts. But although Russia expressed its readiness to mediate the dispute=
 just a month earlier, Moscow has since remained noncommittal. Caught betwe=
en two important partners, Russia is wary of jeopardizing financial, trade =
and military ties with either India or Pakistan, particularly as Western go=
vernments continue to try to isolate it through sanctions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Acting as a peacem=
aker =E2=80=93 especially between two nuclear powers =E2=80=93 could boost =
the Kremlin=E2=80=99s global standing and raise the appeal of membership in=
 non-Western regional organizations. India, Pakistan and Russia are all mem=
bers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and last year Islamabad expr=
essed its desire to join the other two in the BRICS grouping. Strengthening=
 these organizations would dilute the influence of Western countries, parti=
cularly the U.S., in this part of the world and bring Russia and the Global=
 South closer.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Moscow has played =
peacemaker in this region in the past. The Soviet Union helped broker the 1=
966 Tashkent Declaration between India and Pakistan. However, though the de=
al established peace following the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, it did not resol=
ve the Kashmir dispute. The continued conflict over the disputed region eff=
ectively ended the Soviets' diplomatic efforts. Russia does not want to par=
ticipate in initiatives for which success is questionable, since failed pea=
ce deals could discredit it as a global mediator. Moreover, amid sanctions =
and the Russia-Ukraine war, sustaining trade ties takes precedence over bui=
lding Moscow's credentials as a broker, and the risks of offending either I=
ndia or Pakistan are too great.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Were it to get mor=
e involved, Moscow may lean toward New Delhi. Since Soviet times, India has=
 been portrayed in Russian political culture as a friendly partner. The two=
 countries maintain formal agreements on counterterrorism cooperation, incl=
uding joint efforts within the BRICS and the SCO=E2=80=99s regional counter=
terrorism center. India is also a vital customer for Russia=E2=80=99s oil p=
roducers and defense companies. Its purchases of Russian crude oil have sur=
ged tenfold over the past three years, reaching an all-time high in March. =
Long-term deals, such as Rosneft=E2=80=99s 10-year agreement with India=E2=
=80=99s Reliance for 500,000 barrels of crude per day, provide critical rev=
enue for Moscow. India also invests heavily in Russia=E2=80=99s fuel and en=
ergy sector and has been offered a stake in the all-important Vostok Oil pr=
oject. Additionally, New Delhi is a significant buyer of Russian S-400 air =
defense systems. The two countries also co-developed BrahMos missiles, whic=
h performed well in India=E2=80=99s recent clash with Pakistan, prompting h=
opes in Moscow for expanded military cooperation =E2=80=93 even as India ha=
s recently turned to Western suppliers for military transport and patrol ai=
rcraft, Rafale fighters and Apache attack helicopters.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But however import=
ant India is for the Kremlin, Russia is in no position to alienate its few =
remaining allies =E2=80=93 particularly one like Pakistan, a rare partner i=
nterested in deepening cooperation with Russia despite sanctions. Historica=
lly, Russia-Pakistan relations were fraught, strained first by Islamabad=E2=
=80=99s support for anti-Soviet mujahideen in Afghanistan and later by Mosc=
ow=E2=80=99s alignment with New Delhi. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Vladimi=
r Putin even ruled out military-technical cooperation with Pakistan, citing=
 Indian objections. Things began to change a few years later as Pakistan co=
nsidered joining the SCO (which it finally did in 2017) and working with Ru=
ssia and others against terrorism. Always mindful of security threats in Ce=
ntral Asia, Moscow offered Islamabad its support against the Taliban. In 20=
14, Russia lifted its arms embargo on Pakistan and signed some military-tec=
hnical cooperation agreements. Since 2016, they have regularly conducted jo=
int military drills, most recently in October 2024, and in March their navi=
es held joint exercises in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Economic ties are =
also growing as Moscow seeks alternative trade partners in the East. In 201=
5, a year after Russia=E2=80=99s initial limited incursion into eastern Ukr=
aine and Crimea and the imposition of modest Western sanctions, Russia and =
Pakistan signed a deal to build a north-south gas pipeline from Karachi to =
Lahore. In 2023, they inked a long-term oil supply agreement, and within a =
few years, Pakistan expects Russian oil to meet up to 30 percent of its ann=
ual demand. Although sanctions have restricted Russia=E2=80=99s ability to =
settle trade, Pakistan has not been deterred, instead resorting to barterin=
g or the Chinese yuan to keep up economic exchange with Russia. In October,=
 Moscow hosted the first Russia-Pakistan investment forum, drawing more tha=
n 70 Pakistani business leaders and more than 100 Russian firms.</p>

 geography enhances its appeal to Russia. Located at the crossroads of Sout=

 strategically valuable. The potential inclusion of Afghanistan =E2=80=93 a=
ided by Russia=E2=80=99s removal of the Taliban from its list of terrorist =
organizations and China=E2=80=99s facilitation of better Pakistan-Afghanist=
an diplomatic ties =E2=80=93 greatly increases the appeal of an economic co=

Russia and Uzbekistan advanced the Trans-Afghan Railway project, which will=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Speaking on the 25=
th anniversary of strategic relations between Russia and India, Russia=E2=
=80=99s ambassador to India emphasized trust as the cornerstone of bilatera=
l relations. But trust, he warned, can be destroyed in a single moment. Thi=
s is the essence of Moscow=E2=80=99s dilemma. India =E2=80=93 whose trade w=
ith Russia far surpasses Pakistan=E2=80=99s =E2=80=93 opposes third-party m=
ediation with Pakistan. Instead, it expects Russia to endorse its counterte=
rrorism operations, including against targets inside Pakistan. Conversely, =
Islamabad welcomes Moscow=E2=80=99s mediation and offers untapped economic =
opportunities. For now, the Kremlin is in a holding pattern, calculating th=
e cost of action versus inaction. With strategic influence and energy and d=
efense exports on the line, Moscow cannot afford to make a wrong move.</p>
