June 11=2C 2025

Comment/Question: In your article you write: =E2=80=9CIt is not a kindness=
 to allow strangers in America to remain strangers=E2=80=A6 I blame a misp=
laced kindness that seeks to make immigrants not pay the price of admissio=
n.=E2=80=9D

If kindness is misplaced=2C what should kindly thinking Americans do now i=
nstead? What do you think an appropriate price of admission is?

Response: From my point of view there was a period of time during the Bide=
n administration that seemed to me and others to imply that immigrants=2C=
 focusing on ones from Latin America=2C would be allowed to enter the Unit=
ed States and abide here without going through the normal immigration proc=
ess. When I look back on what actual policy was (and it was constantly shi=
fting)=2C I found it very difficult to extract what the rules actually wer=
e and reconcile them with what Biden said. When I compare the various init=
iatives to each other and map them against public statements=2C there is i=
n my mind a continual shifting and contradiction in the formal point=2C bu=
t a consistent rhetoric about inclusion. An immigration lawyer might under=
stand what the regulations were=2C but without that expertise I drew from=
 it the intent to allow people into the country without a formal process=
=2C and without a time limit for remaining.

As a resident of south Texas=2C living about 230 miles from the border wit=
h Mexico=2C I and my neighbors have long depended on Latinos for doing hou=
se cleaning and landscape maintenance. Given the difficulty of understandi=
ng Biden=E2=80=99s policies=2C and being quite comfortable with Mexican mi=
grants=2C I took his meaning to be that the border checks had been dramati=
cally reduced. I do not consider myself an unsophisticated man=2C so if I=
 could draw the conclusions that I did =E2=80=93 without much concern=2C a=
s Latino labor is a norm where I live =E2=80=93 I took it to mean that the=
 welcome mat was laid out.

My view is that if I drew that conclusion from the less than coherent poli=
cy shifts=2C then it is no surprise that unsophisticated Mexicans and othe=
rs from south of Mexico drew the same conclusion=2C particularly as at var=
ious points the border seemed in fact open. I admit not to have read all t=
he fine print or parsed all of the Biden administration=E2=80=99s statemen=
ts=2C but I assumed that a new policy was in place. I think that if I had=
 that view (without much anxiety=2C based on past experience)=2C many Mexi=
cans and others=2C generally poor and poorly educated=2C drew the same con=
clusion. They listened to what they heard from Biden and from the media an=
d believed what they heard.

I allowed myself to be misled but my error had little effect on my life. P=
oorly educated Mexicans=2C in my mind=2C made the same mistake with devast=
ating consequences. I think they as a group thought the rules of immigrati=
on had radically changed. I feel for them (and here I break my rule of not=
 allowing my sentiment to intrude on politics)=2C as the Biden administrat=
ion had created an incoherent jumble of regulations that seemingly provide=
d an open border. I do not think the Mexicans and other Latinos uprooted t=
hemselves from their native countries=2C along with children=2C without sh=
aring this view. I was unclear on what the law was=2C and I must say that=
 I hold the Biden administration as guilty of failing to say in BOLD PRINT=
 that the border wasn=E2=80=99t opened for permanent residence. The migran=
ts came with false hopes. They were not conning America. America had conne=
d them=2C and I hold the former president responsible for misleading them.

I also feel as Trump does: that this surge of migrants is untenable. I do=
 believe that the migrants were victims who might need to leave the U.S.=
=2C but the term =E2=80=9Cillegal=E2=80=9D is not warranted because=2C whi=
le the law might have been clear to specialized lawyers=2C it was not clea=
r to me nor to those who came here=2C based on rhetoric and not law. Some=
 may have been true criminals=2C but I suspect that most were simply the h=
uddled masses yearning to be free and have a better life. Given the lack o=
f clarity of Biden=E2=80=99s policies=2C it is not clear to me that many o=
f these thought themselves illegally here. Given that to some extent they=
 were victims of ambiguity at best=2C a more orderly and less terrifying r=
esponse would have been more appropriate. It is up to the president to det=
ermine what must be done=2C but labeling their presence in the United Stat=
es as illegal and therefore criminal overstates the matter. Particularly g=
iven our own demographic problems=2C it could be handled with more sympath=
y and kindness=2C
and they were victims more than criminals (with significant exceptions of=
 actual criminals.)
Comment/Question: Studies by the marketing industry have found that the wa=
y to make sales is by urging people to be more selfish and greedier. This=
 successful sales strategy in a capitalist society has come at the expense=
 of individual investment in the community.

What would be needed (or is it even possible) to have a return to focus on=
 the community? What do you think of the Chinese =E2=80=9Csocial score=E2=
=80=9D system for each individual in society?


Response: The two things that are fundamental to human life are greed and=
 fear. The two combine to make us as we are. Marketing does not produce ei=
ther=2C it simply faces the reality of life. I have not examined the socia=
l score system in China=2C but I strongly suspect that it is less about be=
ing socially responsible than about being political reliable. Humans desir=
e things and fear things=2C and in each society what they desire and fear=
 may be different=2C but I have travelled the world and have not found soc=
ieties that are not rooted in this. I have found individuals devoid of fea=
r or of greed=2C and a few with neither=2C but I regard fear and greed as=
 essential but insufficient components of humanity. A good marketing perso=
n knows that in his bones.
Question: The U.S. immigration systems and institutions are overwhelmed. W=
hat can be done to relieve this pressure (beyond reintroducing quotas)? Wh=
at is needed for them to be effective?

Response: The first thing that is needed is to recognize our need for peop=
le. Given our demographics=2C we badly need immigrants. The United States=
 from its founding needed people to build this country=2C and we still do.=
 The problem of immigration is that those who leave their homes are usuall=
y the poorest and least educated. But we need that first generation for me=
nial work.

The miracle of America is upward mobility. The children of the first-gener=
ation immigrants surge upward=2C leaving a need for more menial labor. In=
 order to be more effective=2C we have to face the fact that upward mobili=
ty demands a constant flow of menial labor. So we prize upward mobility bu=
t don=E2=80=99t want to fuel the American machine. True=2C not all immigra=
nts are coming in at the bottom=2C but most do and we sure need them. As a=
n Irish bartender once told me=2C =E2=80=9CEveryone is too good to clean m=
y toilet.=E2=80=9D
Comment/Question: Towards the end of =E2=80=9CThe Next 100 Years=E2=80=9D=
=2C which addresses the end of the 21st century=2C you talk about how towa=
rds the end of the socio-economic cycle there would be mass deportations a=
nd protests in the U.S. Southwest. You said in the book that in a scenario=
 the U.S. President would federalize the National Guard and send troops to=
 patrol Southwestern U.S. cities to stop the vandalizing of federal buildi=
ngs and property. And that a city like Los Angeles would still need to be=
 patrolled by grunt infantrymen. That the American public would view it as=
 patrolling a foreign country. Also in =E2=80=9CThe Storm Before the Calm=
=E2=80=9D you wrote that there would be a common interest for the Hispanic=
s in a new political coalition.

But isn=E2=80=99t the weakness of the Hispanics shown by the rioting in Lo=
s Angeles? Their power is felt through economic=2C cultural and political=
 power=2C not by rioting in the streets. So are we seeing a flash forward=
 in today's times of what possibly might come towards the end of the centu=
ry?

Response: What I was speaking of in =E2=80=9CThe Next 100 Years=E2=80=9D w=
as the emergence of Mexico as a serious power=2C and that it had historica=
l issues with the United States over the borders=2C given that the U.S. oc=
cupies what was once northern Mexico. I did not anticipate fully that nort=
hern migration would create this kind of chaos. But then who of us remembe=
rs when the 82^nd Airborne Division was called out to put down riots in De=
troit back in the 1970s?

So I regard these events as tragic but passing=2C and my prediction of Mex=
ico as an emerging power is far from coming true at this point in the cent=
ury. However=2C I still see it as what might come later in this century=2C=
 and that includes the growth of future Hispanic generations living in the=
 United States developing that economic=2C cultural and political power.

June 6=2C 2025

Question: Given Russia=E2=80=99s weakness=2C is it possible the West is ov=
erthinking what's happening in Russian border nations now? For example=2C=
 while Romania doesn=E2=80=99t have a large population=2C its military has=
 really upgraded their capabilities. Romania can inflict a lot of damage.

Response: I=E2=80=99m not sure that the West is a single entity anymore. T=
he national differences are re-emerging. The fear of Russia is in part the=
 remnants of a recent memory of what Russia was=2C and the reality of what=
 they might once again become. In much of Eastern Europe=2C especially Rom=
ania=2C the concern with Russia is based on what it was and their memory o=
f life under the Soviet Union. Romania has strong military and security re=
lations with the United States=2C but if the U.S. were to totally disengag=
e from Europe=2C Romania must be ready to defend itself=2C which is why th=
ey are taking seriously upgrading their capabilities. They do not believe=
 that Russia is far weaker than it was. But overestimating your enemy is n=
ot a bad thing. Underestimating is far worse.
Question: What are your thoughts on the possibility and dangers of NATO en=
ding up in a war with Russia? Could you factor in Russia=E2=80=99s declini=
ng power as a dangerous thing and how France=E2=80=99s assistance in helpi=
ng Ukraine to bomb those long-range nuclear-capable bombers has made a pea=
ce settlement impossible for the near future?

Response: NATO was not built to be an offensive power. It is militarily a=
 defensive power. As far as Russia goes=2C their performance in Ukraine ha=
s been=2C as I constantly repeat=2C profoundly ineffective. The issue in E=
urope is not Russia. It is whether there will occur some variation of a Un=
ited States of Europe=2C or a return to the nationalism that tore Europe a=
part over the centuries. The question on the peace settlement depends on t=
wo things: the military capability of Russia=2C and whether Putin survives=
 the ongoing failures.

On the military side=2C for over three years the Russians have thrown what=
 appears to be a substantial portion of their military capability at Ukrai=
ne without defeating them. In view of this=2C I=E2=80=99m not sure what fu=
rther military might they may have except for nuclear weapons. As for Puti=
n=E2=80=99s political survival=2C in addition to what was to be a short wa=
r turning into a very long one=2C we must note the massive failure of Russ=
ian intelligence and counterintelligence in allowing this to happen to the=
ir long-range bombers. It is inevitable that there be serious doubts about=
 Putin=E2=80=99s capability as a leader. While he is a dictator=2C he is n=
ot Stalin or Lenin. There must be factions that are deeply questioning his=
 policies.

So the real question to ask is what can Russia do that it hasn=E2=80=99t a=
lready tried doing? And what are the political consequences of an unending=
 war with a million casualties and little to show for it? So I don=E2=80=
=99t think his record indicates increasing danger except that he could try=
 using nuclear weapons with uncertain consequences for the Russian people=
=2C while at the same time refusing a peace settlement and possibly motiva=
ting the United States for a massive infusion of weapons into Ukraine.
Question: Why is China not mentioned in your Serbia analysis? For several=
 years Beijing has been pouring money and influence into Serbia (and Hunga=
ry). Examples include that China delivered the HQ-22/FK-3 weapons systems=
 to Serbia and that Chinese investments (especially in tech and infrastruc=
ture) are significantly higher than those of any other power.

Response: Because on my visit there=2C I encountered few people who were t=
alking about China=2C and an enormous number of people talking about the U=
nited States. China was an important factor in Serbia in the recent past=
=2C but they are not seen at this time as nearly as important as the Unite=
d States. The Chinese were mentioned but not as something they are dependi=
ng on. Of course=2C I didn=E2=80=99t meet all the Serbs. So I confine myse=
lf to those I met in government and business.
Question: Why does the U.S. still have so many troops stationed in Europe?=
 Who benefits from the U.S. troop presence =E2=80=93 Europe=2C the U.S. or=
 both? Theoretically=2C is there a scenario where the U.S. would allow a f=
oreign military to be stationed on U.S. territory?

Response: The United States is being cautious in implementing its intentio=
ns. It intends to withdraw as the Europeans strengthen. In the meantime=2C=
 they have not withdrawn their forces. But note that it was a German briga=
de deployed to Lithuania. The U.S. is being prudent as it proceeds. As to=
 the U.S. allowing a foreign army on its soil =E2=80=93 if the U.S. had be=
en defeated in World War II=2C it would have had no choice but to admit fo=
reign troops. It is the winner who gets to decide whether and where there=
 are troops stationed on its territory.

<strong>Response: </strong>From my point of view there was a period of time=
 during the Biden administration that seemed to me and others to imply that=
 immigrants, focusing on ones from Latin America, would be allowed to enter=
 the United States and abide here without going through the normal immigrat=
ion process. When I look back on what actual policy was (and it was constan=
tly shifting), I found it very difficult to extract what the rules actually=
 were and reconcile them with what Biden said. When I compare the various i=
nitiatives to each other and map them against public statements, there is i=
n my mind a continual shifting and contradiction in the formal point, but a=
 consistent rhetoric about inclusion. An immigration lawyer might understan=
d what the regulations were, but without that expertise I drew from it the =
intent to allow people into the country without a formal process, and witho=
ut a time limit for remaining.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a resident of south Texas, living about 230 miles from the border with M=
exico, I and my neighbors have long depended on Latinos for doing house cle=
aning and landscape maintenance. Given the difficulty of understanding Bide=
n=E2=80=99s policies, and being quite comfortable with Mexican migrants, I =
took his meaning to be that the border checks had been dramatically reduced=
. I do not consider myself an unsophisticated man, so if I could draw the c=
onclusions that I did =E2=80=93 without much concern, as Latino labor is a =
norm where I live =E2=80=93 I took it to mean that the welcome mat was laid=
 out.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My view is that if I drew that conclusion from the less than coherent polic=
y shifts, then it is no surprise that unsophisticated Mexicans and others f=
rom south of Mexico drew the same conclusion, particularly as at various po=
ints the border seemed in fact open. I admit not to have read all the fine =
print or parsed all of the Biden administration=E2=80=99s statements, but I=
 assumed that a new policy was in place. I think that if I had that view (w=
ithout much anxiety, based on past experience), many Mexicans and others, g=
enerally poor and poorly educated, drew the same conclusion. They listened =
to what they heard from Biden and from the media and believed what they hea=
rd.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I allowed myself to be misled but my error had little effect on my life. Po=
orly educated Mexicans, in my mind, made the same mistake with devastating =
consequences. I think they as a group thought the rules of immigration had =
radically changed. I feel for them (and here I break my rule of not allowin=
g my sentiment to intrude on politics), as the Biden administration had cre=
ated an incoherent jumble of regulations that seemingly provided an open bo=
rder. I do not think the Mexicans and other Latinos uprooted themselves fro=
m their native countries, along with children, without sharing this view. I=
 was unclear on what the law was, and I must say that I hold the Biden admi=
nistration as guilty of failing to say in BOLD PRINT that the border wasn=
=E2=80=99t opened for permanent residence. The migrants came with false hop=
es. They were not conning America. America had conned them, and I hold the =
former president responsible for misleading them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I also feel as Trump does: that this surge of migrants is untenable. I do b=
elieve that the migrants were victims who might need to leave the U.S., but=
 the term =E2=80=9Cillegal=E2=80=9D is not warranted because, while the law=
 might have been clear to specialized lawyers, it was not clear to me nor t=
o those who came here, based on rhetoric and not law. Some may have been tr=
ue criminals, but I suspect that most were simply the huddled masses yearni=
ng to be free and have a better life. Given the lack of clarity of Biden=E2=
=80=99s policies, it is not clear to me that many of these thought themselv=
es illegally here. Given that to some extent they were victims of ambiguity=
 at best, a more orderly and less terrifying response would have been more =
appropriate. It is up to the president to determine what must be done, but =
labeling their presence in the United States as illegal and therefore crimi=
nal overstates the matter. Particularly given our own demographic problems,=
 it could be handled with more sympathy and kindness, and they were victims=
 more than criminals (with significant exceptions of actual criminals.)</p>

                            <strong>Comment/Question: </strong><em>Studies =
by the marketing industry have found that the way to make sales is by urgin=
g people to be more selfish and greedier. This successful sales strategy in=
 a capitalist society has come at the expense of individual investment in t=
he community.<br>
<br>
What would be needed (or is it even possible) to have a return to focus on =
the community? What do you think of the Chinese =E2=80=9Csocial score=E2=80=
=9D system for each individual in society?</em><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The two things that are fundamental to human lif=
e are greed and fear. The two combine to make us as we are. Marketing does =
not produce either, it simply faces the reality of life. I have not examine=
d the social score system in China, but I strongly suspect that it is less =
about being socially responsible than about being political reliable. Human=
s desire things and fear things, and in each society what they desire and f=
ear may be different, but I have travelled the world and have not found soc=
ieties that are not rooted in this. I have found individuals devoid of fear=
 or of greed, and a few with neither, but I regard fear and greed as essent=
ial but insufficient components of humanity. A good marketing person knows =
that in his bones.

                            <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>The U.S. im=
migration systems and institutions are overwhelmed. What can be done to rel=
ieve this pressure (beyond reintroducing quotas)? What is needed for them t=
o be effective?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The first thing that is needed is to recognize o=
ur need for people. Given our demographics, we badly need immigrants. The U=
nited States from its founding needed people to build this country, and we =
still do. The problem of immigration is that those who leave their homes ar=
e usually the poorest and least educated. But we need that first generation=
 for menial work.<br>
<br>
The miracle of America is upward mobility. The children of the first-genera=
tion immigrants surge upward, leaving a need for more menial labor. In orde=
r to be more effective, we have to face the fact that upward mobility deman=
ds a constant flow of menial labor. So we prize upward mobility but don=E2=
=80=99t want to fuel the American machine. True, not all immigrants are com=
ing in at the bottom, but most do and we sure need them. As an Irish barten=
der once told me, =E2=80=9CEveryone is too good to clean my toilet.=E2=80=

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Tow=
ards the end of =E2=80=9CThe Next 100 Years=E2=80=9D, which addresses the e=
nd of the 21st century, you talk about how towards the end of the socio-eco=
nomic cycle there would be mass deportations and protests in the U.S. South=
west. You said in the book that in a scenario the U.S. President would fede=
ralize the National Guard and send troops to patrol Southwestern U.S. citie=
s to stop the vandalizing of federal buildings and property. And that a cit=
y like Los Angeles would still need to be patrolled by grunt infantrymen. T=
hat the American public would view it as patrolling a foreign country. Also=
 in =E2=80=9CThe Storm Before the Calm=E2=80=9D you wrote that there would =
be a common interest for the Hispanics in a new political coalition.<br>
<br>
But isn=E2=80=99t the weakness of the Hispanics shown by the rioting in Los=
 Angeles? Their power is felt through economic, cultural and political powe=
r, not by rioting in the streets. So are we seeing a flash forward in today=
's times of what possibly might come towards the end of the century?</em><s=
trong> </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>What I was speaking of in =E2=80=9CThe Next 100 =
Years=E2=80=9D was the emergence of Mexico as a serious power, and that it =
had historical issues with the United States over the borders, given that t=
he U.S. occupies what was once northern Mexico. I did not anticipate fully =
that northern migration would create this kind of chaos. But then who of us=
 remembers when the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne Division was called out to put=
 down riots in Detroit back in the 1970s?<br>
<br>
So I regard these events as tragic but passing, and my prediction of Mexico=
 as an emerging power is far from coming true at this point in the century.=
 However, I still see it as what might come later in this century, and that=
 includes the growth of future Hispanic generations living in the United St=
ates developing that economic, cultural and political power.

<strong>Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Given Russia=E2=80=99s weaknes=
s, is it possible the West is overthinking what's happening in Russian bord=
er nations now? For example, while Romania doesn=E2=80=99t have a large pop=
ulation, its military has really upgraded their capabilities. Romania can i=
nflict a lot of damage.&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>I=E2=80=99m not sure that the West is a single e=
ntity anymore. The national differences are re-emerging. The fear of Russia=
 is in part the remnants of a recent memory of what Russia was, and the rea=
lity of what they might once again become. In much of Eastern Europe, espec=
ially Romania, the concern with Russia is based on what it was and their me=
mory of life under the Soviet Union. Romania has strong military and securi=
ty relations with the United States, but if the U.S. were to totally diseng=
age from Europe, Romania must be ready to defend itself, which is why they =
are taking seriously upgrading their capabilities. They do not believe that=
 Russia is far weaker than it was. But overestimating your enemy is not a b=
ad thing. Underestimating is far worse.</p>

                            <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>What are yo=
ur thoughts on the possibility and dangers of NATO ending up in a war with =
Russia? Could you factor in Russia=E2=80=99s declining power as a dangerous=
 thing and how France=E2=80=99s assistance in helping Ukraine to bomb those=
 long-range nuclear-capable bombers has made a peace settlement impossible =
for the near future?</em><strong> </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>NATO was not built to be an offensive power. It =
is militarily a defensive power. As far as Russia goes, their performance i=
n Ukraine has been, as I constantly repeat, profoundly ineffective. The iss=
ue in Europe is not Russia. It is whether there will occur some variation o=
f a United States of Europe, or a return to the nationalism that tore Europ=
e apart over the centuries. The question on the peace settlement depends on=
 two things: the military capability of Russia, and whether Putin survives =
the ongoing failures.<br>
<br>
On the military side, for over three years the Russians have thrown what ap=
pears to be a substantial portion of their military capability at Ukraine w=
ithout defeating them. In view of this, I=E2=80=99m not sure what further m=
ilitary might they may have except for nuclear weapons. As for Putin=E2=80=
=99s political survival, in addition to what was to be a short war turning =
into a very long one, we must note the massive failure of Russian intellige=
nce and counterintelligence in allowing this to happen to their long-range =
bombers. It is inevitable that there be serious doubts about Putin=E2=80=99=
s capability as a leader. While he is a dictator, he is not Stalin or Lenin=
. There must be factions that are deeply questioning his policies.<br>
<br>
So the real question to ask is what can Russia do that it hasn=E2=80=99t al=
ready tried doing? And what are the political consequences of an unending w=
ar with a million casualties and little to show for it? So I don=E2=80=99t =
think his record indicates increasing danger except that he could try using=
 nuclear weapons with uncertain consequences for the Russian people, while =
at the same time refusing a peace settlement and possibly motivating the Un=
ited States for a massive infusion of weapons into Ukraine.

                            <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Why is Chin=
a not mentioned in your Serbia analysis? For several years Beijing has been=
 pouring money and influence into Serbia (and Hungary). Examples include th=
at China delivered the HQ-22/FK-3 weapons systems to Serbia and that Chines=
e investments (especially in tech&nbsp;and infrastructure)&nbsp;are signifi=
cantly higher than those of any other power.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Because on my visit there, I encountered few peo=
ple who were talking about China, and an enormous number of people talking =
about the United States. China was an important factor in Serbia in the rec=
ent past, but they are not seen at this time as nearly as important as the =
United States. The Chinese were mentioned but not as something they are dep=
ending on. Of course, I didn=E2=80=99t meet all the Serbs. So I confine mys=
elf to those I met in government and business.

                            <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Why does th=
e U.S. still have so many troops stationed in Europe? Who benefits from the=
 U.S. troop presence =E2=80=93 Europe, the U.S. or both? Theoretically, is =
there a scenario where the U.S. would allow a foreign military to be statio=
ned on U.S. territory?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The United States is being cautious in implement=
ing its intentions. It intends to withdraw as the Europeans strengthen. In =
the meantime, they have not withdrawn their forces. But note that it was a =
German brigade deployed to Lithuania. The U.S. is being prudent as it proce=
eds. As to the U.S. allowing a foreign army on its soil =E2=80=93 if the U.=
S. had been defeated in World War II, it would have had no choice but to ad=
mit foreign troops. It is the winner who gets to decide whether and where t=
here are troops stationed on its territory.
