June 30=2C 2025

Question:
Comment 1. Clearly=2C while your world insights eclipse most anyone=E2=80=
=99s I encourage you to not fall into the hate Donald Trump Club by making=
 him look erratic undisciplined.

Comment 2. You have described a complex and well considered strategy on di=
plomacy. Trump is not bright enough for what you describe.

Response:
I have placed these two comments side by side=2C one thinking I have made=
 Trump look bad=2C and the other saying that I have made him look too smar=
t.

First the direct answer. Early in my career I realized that being an analy=
st is incompatible with being partisan. Over time I came to what is perhap=
s a more sophisticated understanding=2C which is that elections are not ba=
sed on voters=E2=80=99 views but that views are determined by the massive=
 historical forces that shape human thought and generate those opinions. S=
ince different people experience those forces in different ways=2C we wind=
 up with different people having different views of the same thing. If you=
 can understand the impersonal forces of economics=2C geopolitics and the=
 rest=2C you can understand and to some extent predict the options that ar=
e open=2C and understand the way that opinions are shaped and divided betw=
een nations=2C within nations and between people.

Therefore=2C it is not surprising that one person should caution me to not=
 underestimate Trump=2C and another to not overestimate him. The comments=
 above are consolidations of two commonly held views representing the divi=
sion of the nation on Trump. I have written in some books (The Storm Befor=
e the Calm) and articles on the forces leading to the intensity of this di=
vision=2C which doesn=E2=80=99t fit into the space available here=2C but f=
rom my point of view this divided feeling of the two comments demonstrates=
 the health of our democracy.

The foundation of democracy is not only that the citizens ultimately gover=
n=2C but that the citizens are and should be divided. Tyrannies emerge fro=
m societies where there is an overwhelming consensus that crushes diversit=
y. A healthy democracy avoids tyranny partly because of a divided populati=
on and the constant evolution of belief. So read by one citizen=2C my arti=
cle seems to be based on admiration for the president=2C the other sees it=
 based on loathing.  It is this division that guarantees a democratic soci=
ety.

I have lived long enough to remember the love and loathing of many preside=
nts. Sentiment surrounding Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon was no less divide=
d or intense than the sentiment surrounding Trump.  When we accuse Trump o=
f wanting to be a dictator=2C we are levelling an accusation that many pre=
sidents since the founding have faced. From my point of view=2C Trump has=
 twice been elected by the majority of voters. He=2C more than most candid=
ates=2C did not make an attempt to hide his personality or his core belief=
s. He was elected=2C and the people have spoken. For me=2C the social and=
 economic forces of America and the world caused his election.  His majori=
ty is kept in check by the vigorous loathing of him and the deep belief by=
 many that his presidency is dangerous and in some way illegitimate. That=
 powerful sense shapes and defines his presidency and reflects a deep divi=
sion that has developed in America and is a healthy process in a democracy=
 in which any candidate for president has this in common
with all presidents: a large ego that allows him to believe that he should=
 govern the Republic. And in this=2C a good analyst is always distrusted b=
y both sides.
Question: You have made comments in the past about the felicitous position=
 of the United States between two militarily weak nations [Mexico=2C Cana=
da] with no axes to grind. Why would Trump mess this up?

Response: Nations always have issues between each other. What is peculiar=
 is the degree to which the United States and particularly Canada=2C and t=
o a lesser extent Mexico=2C had few such issues. This is not the norm (a t=
erm I hate) of relations between countries. The emergence of significant i=
ssues between countries=2C particularly neighbors=2C is returning to the n=
orm. So I am more amazed by the lack of tension than by its presence. I al=
so believe that this is a passing phase of a nation in the process of shif=
ting its position in the world; weaker neighbors are stunned and angered b=
y such shifts. Mexico and Canada will adjust to the changes and the newly=
 created reality simply because neither is strong enough to resist its gia=
nt neighbor.
Question: How does Trump operate once a negotiation is accomplished? Does=
 he stay a provocateur or become a trusted partner in joint success?

Response: International relations are constantly changing because the real=
ities inside countries are constantly shifting. Previous agreements are th=
erefore changed=2C even abandoned. It is extraordinary that the American r=
elationship with Western Europe remained fairly stable for 80 years=2C and=
 it is reasonable that the Europeans wanted that to continue and the Unite=
d States wanted to redefine it. So will Trump honor his agreements? He wil=
l until he deems it not in American interest to do so=2C as will the natio=
ns he made deals with. It=E2=80=99s kind of like marriages. They last as l=
ong as husband and wife both wish it to. Nations are human institutions=2C=
 and the marriage might last or not.
The Discussion Continues - George=E2=80=99s answers to last week=E2=80=99s=
 follow up questions.
Question/Comment: Regarding lobbyists and corporations =E2=80=93 While I a=
gree to the fact that it is part of democracy=2C wealthy people and corpor=
ations seem to have no limits to campaign contributions. And when super PA=
Cs are used=2C we don't even know who contributed=2C how much they contrib=
uted or who it went to. Campaign finance reform only remains popular among=
 the losing parties. What are your thoughts on the need for campaign finan=
ce reform and what it would take to get such reforms ushered in?

Response: Campaign contributions allow for the purchase of advertisements.=
 I am not  certain when the last time was that I watched television. We ow=
n a couple=2C but we look at Netflix movies=2C or DVDs=2C or read books. I=
 am not certain that television ads matter much anymore=2C or that many pe=
ople are buying newspapers with political advertisements with them. Today=
=2C social media and online publications like mine are the norm. So the ol=
d model is not as essential. I guess money is needed for travel expenses=
=2C but I would suspect that we are now in an ideological period in which=
 voters have pre-packaged beliefs=2C or are influenced more online than wi=
th money. I am not certain on this=2C but I think the period of the last c=
entury where advertising was a critical element of elections is still in p=
lace=2C and elections are influenced by money. I am genuinely not sure abo=
ut this=2C and haven=E2=80=99t really thought about it=2C but this questio=
n caused me to wonder just how much influence money has in today=E2=80=99s=
 elections.
Comment/Question: You mentioned that Congress should make the decision to=
 go to war based on the Constitution. You also mentioned that modern war t=
echnologies allow only a few minutes for a reaction time. Our Constitution=
 requires such questions be addressed by Congress. What are the chances Co=
ngress could do so by updating the definition of a =E2=80=9Cdeclaration of=
 war=E2=80=9D? What could a possible new definition look like? When doing=
 so=2C please take into consideration how precedence set by Presidents (WP=
A=2C etc) do not define nor do they constrain the level of conflict in whi=
ch a president may engage.

Response: The definition of war is one nation attacking another=2C and sol=
diers killing each other. We have invented new names for war =E2=80=93 pea=
cekeeping=2C counterterrorism and the rest. We have decided that the invas=
ion of Grenada was not an act of war but something else that I don=E2=80=
=99t remember. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor=2C that was an act of=
 war. When we bombed Iran=2C that was an act of war. One of the fundamenta=
l problems we have today is that the surprise attack cannot start with a C=
ongressional debate=2C and when we went to war in Vietnam=2C a declaration=
 of war was not deemed to be appropriate=2C since American involvement sta=
rted small and then by its end 20 years later had taken 50=2C000 American=
 lives. So we need to develop a different process for going to war than wh=
at=E2=80=99s in the Constitution=2C which requires more than a presidentia=
l decision to go to war. There are several new laws that allow us to wage=
 war on a presidential order=2C but the reason I don=E2=80=99t like them i=
s that they run counter
to the Constitutional constraint=2C and that sets a precedent for other vi=
olations of the Constitution by the president.

<strong>Response: </strong></p>

<div>I have placed these two comments side by side, one thinking I have mad=
e Trump look bad, and the other saying that I have made him look too smart.=
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
First the direct answer. Early in my career I realized that being an analys=
t is incompatible with being partisan. Over time I came to what is perhaps =
a more sophisticated understanding, which is that elections are not based o=
n voters=E2=80=99 views but that views are determined by the massive histor=
ical forces that shape human thought and generate those opinions. Since dif=
ferent people experience those forces in different ways, we wind up with di=
fferent people having different views of the same thing. If you can underst=
and the impersonal forces of economics, geopolitics and the rest, you can u=
nderstand and to some extent predict the options that are open, and underst=
and the way that opinions are shaped and divided between nations, within na=
tions and between people.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Therefore, it is not surprising that one person should caution me to not un=
derestimate Trump, and another to not overestimate him. The comments above =
are consolidations of two commonly held views representing the division of =
the nation on Trump. I have written in some books (The Storm Before the Cal=
m) and articles on the forces leading to the intensity of this division, wh=
ich doesn=E2=80=99t fit into the space available here, but from my point of=
 view this divided feeling of the two comments demonstrates the health of o=
ur democracy.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The foundation of democracy is not only that the citizens ultimately govern=
, but that the citizens are and should be divided. Tyrannies emerge from so=
cieties where there is an overwhelming consensus that crushes diversity. A =
healthy democracy avoids tyranny partly because of a divided population and=
 the constant evolution of belief. So read by one citizen, my article seems=
 to be based on admiration for the president, the other sees it based on lo=
athing.&nbsp; It is this division that guarantees a democratic society.&nbs=
p;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have lived long enough to remember the love and loathing of many presiden=
ts. Sentiment surrounding Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon was no less divided =
or intense than the sentiment surrounding Trump.&nbsp; When we accuse Trump=
 of wanting to be a dictator, we are levelling an accusation that many pres=
idents since the founding have faced. From my point of view, Trump has twic=
e been elected by the majority of voters. He, more than most candidates, di=
d not make an attempt to hide his personality or his core beliefs. He was e=
lected, and the people have spoken. For me, the social and economic forces =
of America and the world caused his election.&nbsp; His majority is kept in=
 check by the vigorous loathing of him and the deep belief by many that his=
 presidency is dangerous and in some way illegitimate. That powerful sense =
shapes and defines his presidency and reflects a deep division that has dev=
eloped in America and is a healthy process in a democracy in which any cand=
idate for president has this in common with all presidents: a large ego tha=
t allows him to believe that he should govern the Republic. And in this, a =
good analyst is always distrusted by both sides.</div>

                            <strong>Question: </strong><em>You have made co=
mments in the past about the felicitous position of the United States betwe=
en two militarily weak nations [Mexico, Canada] with no axes to grind. Why =
would Trump mess this up?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>Nations always have issues between each oth=
er. What is peculiar is the degree to which the United States and particula=
rly Canada, and to a lesser extent Mexico, had few such issues. This is not=
 the norm (a term I hate) of relations between countries. The emergence of =
significant issues between countries, particularly neighbors, is returning =
to the norm. So I am more amazed by the lack of tension than by its presenc=
e. I also believe that this is a passing phase of a nation in the process o=
f shifting its position in the world; weaker neighbors are stunned and ange=
red by such shifts. Mexico and Canada will adjust to the changes and the ne=
wly created reality simply because neither is strong enough to resist its g=
iant neighbor.

ump operate once a negotiation is accomplished? Does he stay a provocateur =
or become a trusted partner in joint success?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>International relations are constantly chan=
ging because the realities inside countries are constantly shifting. Previo=
us agreements are therefore changed, even abandoned. It is extraordinary th=
at the American relationship with Western Europe remained fairly stable for=
 80 years, and it is reasonable that the Europeans wanted that to continue =
and the United States wanted to redefine it. So will Trump honor his agreem=
ents? He will until he deems it not in American interest to do so, as will =
the nations he made deals with. It=E2=80=99s kind of like marriages. They l=
ast as long as husband and wife both wish it to. Nations are human institut=
ions, and the marriage might last or not.

                            <strong>Question/Comment:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Reg=
arding lobbyists and corporations =E2=80=93 While I agree to the fact that =
it is part of democracy, wealthy people and corporations seem to have no li=
mits to campaign contributions. And when super PACs are used, we don't even=
 know who contributed, how much they contributed or who it went to. Campaig=
n finance reform only remains popular among the losing parties. What are yo=
ur thoughts on the need for campaign finance reform and what it would take =
to get such reforms ushered in?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>Campaign contributions allow for the purcha=
se of advertisements. I am not&nbsp; certain when the last time was that I =
watched television. We own a couple, but we look at Netflix movies, or DVDs=
, or read books. I am not certain that television ads matter much anymore, =
or that many people are buying newspapers with political advertisements wit=
h them. Today, social media and online publications like mine are the norm.=
 So the old model is not as essential. I guess money is needed for travel e=
xpenses, but I would suspect that we are now in an ideological period in wh=
ich voters have pre-packaged beliefs, or are influenced more online than wi=
th money. I am not certain on this, but I think the period of the last cent=
ury where advertising was a critical element of elections is still in place=
, and elections are influenced by money. I am genuinely not sure about this=
, and haven=E2=80=99t really thought about it, but this question caused me =
to wonder just how much influence money has in today=E2=80=99s elections.

                            <strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em>&nbsp;You=
 mentioned that Congress should make the decision to go to war based on the=
 Constitution. You also mentioned that modern war technologies allow only a=
 few minutes for a reaction time. Our Constitution requires such questions =
be addressed by Congress. What are the chances Congress could do so by upda=
ting the definition of a =E2=80=9Cdeclaration of war=E2=80=9D? What could a=
 possible new definition look like? When doing so, please take into conside=
ration how precedence set by Presidents (WPA, etc) do not define nor do the=
y constrain the level of conflict in which a president may engage.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>The definition of war is one nation attacki=
ng another, and soldiers killing each other. We have invented new names for=
 war =E2=80=93 peacekeeping, counterterrorism and the rest. We have decided=
 that the invasion of Grenada was not an act of war but something else that=
 I don=E2=80=99t remember. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, that was =
an act of war. When we bombed Iran, that was an act of war. One of the fund=
amental problems we have today is that the surprise attack cannot start wit=
h a Congressional debate, and when we went to war in Vietnam, a declaration=
 of war was not deemed to be appropriate, since American involvement starte=
d small and then by its end 20 years later had taken 50,000 American lives.=
 So we need to develop a different process for going to war than what=E2=80=
=99s in the Constitution, which requires more than a presidential decision =
to go to war. There are several new laws that allow us to wage war on a pre=
sidential order, but the reason I don=E2=80=99t like them is that they run =
counter to the Constitutional constraint, and that sets a precedent for oth=
er violations of the Constitution by the president.&nbsp;
