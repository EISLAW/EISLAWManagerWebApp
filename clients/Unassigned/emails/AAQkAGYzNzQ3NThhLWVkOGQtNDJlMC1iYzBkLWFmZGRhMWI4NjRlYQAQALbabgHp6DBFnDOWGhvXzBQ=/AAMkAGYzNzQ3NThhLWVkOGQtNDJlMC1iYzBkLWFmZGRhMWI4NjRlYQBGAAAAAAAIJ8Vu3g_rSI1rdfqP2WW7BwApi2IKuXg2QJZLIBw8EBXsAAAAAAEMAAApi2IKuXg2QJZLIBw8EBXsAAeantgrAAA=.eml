The AI job market is a crowded room where everyone is yelling to be heard.
Frankly, so is the job market as a whole.
Maybe it=E2=80=99s time to change strategies.=20
I spent the last few months studying the job market AND the advice out ther=
e for AI and jobs.=20
Spoiler: most of it makes that job search room more noisy.=20
We=E2=80=99re being told to AI-customize our resumes, our cover letters, to=
 email job recruiters.=20
And I get it. It makes sense to use the power of AI to help make us more pa=
ckaged and polished, yeah? It=E2=80=99s the idea that has launched a thousa=
nd AI job startups.
But the problem is that by October 2025 the returns on that strategy are ge=
tting lower and lower. And we=E2=80=99re putting more and more resources af=
ter those diminishing returns.=20
It=E2=80=99s a giant came of speed dating, we=E2=80=99re all yelling, and n=
o one can figure out where their match is.
So I went back to first principles. I looked at WHY the job market isn=E2=
=80=99t working properly anymore. I analyzed over a hundred pieces of AI ad=
vice, over 1000 AI job applications that have come across my desk in the la=
st few months, and I looked for the hidden principles that no one is talkin=
g about.=20
What I found is fascinating: we=E2=80=99re using AI all wrong.=20
Everyone=E2=80=99s using AI to generate more signals=E2=80=94better resumes=
, shinier portfolios, more applications. But when everyone can generate per=
fect signals at zero cost, those signals become worthless. The real opportu=
nity isn=E2=80=99t generation. It=E2=80=99s verification.
Companies don=E2=80=99t need more candidates. They need to tell which candi=
dates are real. When hiring managers can=E2=80=99t distinguish between AI-g=
enerated polish and genuine capability, the winner isn=E2=80=99t who signal=
s hardest=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s who makes verification easiest.
That=E2=80=99s a fundamentally different game. And it requires fundamentall=
y different tools.
Below, I break down the five principles that separate candidates who get hi=
red from those who drown in the noise. Then I give you five prompts that he=
lp you actually implement them:
The Process Portfolio Builder - Turns your existing projects into verificat=
ion artifacts that show how you think, not just what you built (because hir=
ing managers can=E2=80=99t tell if that polished output came from you or Ch=
atGPT)
The Adaptive Competence Assessment - Creates a self-administered test that =
finds your actual capability ceiling by getting progressively harder until =
you hit your limit (way more signal than a resume that claims =E2=80=9Cexpe=
rt in X=E2=80=9D)
The Company Problem Analysis Framework - Helps you analyze a company=E2=80=
=99s real challenges before you apply, turning your application into bilate=
ral value creation (most companies don=E2=80=99t even know what they need=
=E2=80=94help them figure it out)
The Capability Space Mapper - Maps you to problem types instead of job titl=
es, because =E2=80=9CAI PM=E2=80=9D means fifteen different things and you=
=E2=80=99re getting filtered out by keyword matching that misses your actua=
l fit
The Verifiable Trial Proposal - Structures a paid one-week trial offer that=
 makes saying yes trivially easy for companies (you solve their =E2=80=9Cis=
 this person real?=E2=80=9D problem before they=E2=80=99ve even interviewed=
 you)
These five prompts translate the article=E2=80=99s principles into framewor=
ks that actually help you build the stuff you should be building anyway=E2=
=80=94just faster and better structured.
If the job market is using AI as a megaphone to yell louder, we=E2=80=99re =
gonna change the strategy entirely so we=E2=80=99re not stuck in a rat race=
=2E Instead of yelling, we=E2=80=99re goin=
g to use AI to put the megaphone do=
wn, walk up to the hiring manager, and start an actual conversation.
Let=E2=80=99s dive in.

PG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
These five prompts translate the article=E2=80=99s principles into somethin=
g you can actually use. But they only work if you=E2=80=99re willing to do =
real work.
Here=E2=80=99s what I mean: you can=E2=80=99t feed these prompts polished r=
esume bullets and expect magic. You need to give them honest, detailed cont=
ext about your actual projects=E2=80=94including where you got stuck, what =
failed, what you=E2=80=99d do differently. Then you need to spend time exec=
uting what they suggest. Building the portfolio piece. Taking the assessmen=
t. Analyzing the role. Creating the work sample.
These aren=E2=80=99t advice prompts that give you tips to nod along to. The=
y=E2=80=99re production power tools designed to help you shape your work in=
 a way that produces meaningful evidence that makes it much easier for hiri=
ng teams to evaluate your candidacy.
I won=E2=80=99t hide the ball: you can=E2=80=99t substitute real work here.=
 The prompts are designed to make it vastly easier to showcase the great wo=
rk you already do.  By building verifiable demonstrations of capability, th=
ey=E2=80=99ll give you positioning that ninety-five percent of candidates w=
on=E2=80=99t match.
The choice is yours.
The Job Market Broke. Here=E2=80=99s Why=E2=80=94And What Actually Works No=
w.
Everyone knows LinkedIn is dead. The problem is that most of the advice I s=
ee online is still optimizing for that dead system.
I want to step back and look at the root causes of what=E2=80=99s happening=
 with the AI job market collapse. Not just tactics=E2=80=94principles. By t=
he end of this piece, you=E2=80=99ll understand what=E2=80=99s actually goi=
ng on at a fundamental level, you=E2=80=99ll have a clear sense of your act=
ionable options, and if you=E2=80=99re in the hiring chair, you=E2=80=99ll =
understand how to start differentiating in how you hire.
Let=E2=80=99s get into it.
The Core Problem: AI Made Signals Free (And Worthless)
The job market used to work because signals were expensive to produce.
A resume took time. A good, customized resume took more time. Cover letters=
 required genuine thought. I used to be able to read a resume and sense the=
 effort behind it. The cost worked because it separated signal from noise. =
Strong candidates could afford the effort to customize applications because=
 their returns were higher. Weak candidates faced diseconomies of scale=E2=
=80=94each additional application was nearly as costly as the first.
AI has collapsed that cost to zero.
When you can write a perfect resume in three minutes and pump out ten diffe=
rent custom resumes at zero marginal cost, there is no information in that =
signal. The fancy word for this is Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is play=
ing out in labor markets. The less fancy way of saying it is that because i=
t doesn=E2=80=99t cost anything to make information, that information loses=
 signal value in hiring, and we=E2=80=99re all in trouble.
That=E2=80=99s what we feel, right?
But here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s interesting: we mostly talk about this fr=
om the talent side. A thousand applications per job sucks for everybody. Th=
e problem is, both sides right now tend to give advice that creates more no=
ise to cut the noise. Yell louder. Put a portfolio out there. Build a socia=
l media presence. Post more job descriptions if you=E2=80=99re a hiring man=
ager. It all adds up to this cacophony of noise in the AI job market.
What I want to suggest to you is that the information equilibrium that exis=
ted before 2022 is permanently gone. It is not coming back. More noise does=
 not fix this.
In the past, strong candidates could afford the effort to raise the noise l=
evel and break through with signal. Weak candidates faced limitations with =
their ability to actually put the effort in and generate quality work. LLMs=
 have destroyed the value of effort from good candidates, and they make it =
equally cheap for everyone to produce infinite signals.
I think we have to start by just admitting: the old game that we played bef=
ore 2022 is over, and we don=E2=80=99t know how to play the new game yet. T=
hat=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99m getting to here.
Both Sides Are Drowning
Every current =E2=80=9Csolution=E2=80=9D is adding to that noise. And I wan=
t to be honest about that. When you optimize your resume with Claude, when =
you optimize your portfolio website with GPT, it all adds to the noise.
But here=E2=80=99s what most people miss: companies face exactly the same c=
ollapse.
Job descriptions are now free to generate. So companies post roles they don=
=E2=80=99t fully understand, claiming to need =E2=80=9CAI expertise=E2=80=
=9D without defining it. Posting a role is no longer a costly signal that f=
orced them to crystallize what they actually wanted. Both sides are creatin=
g noise trying to cut through noise.
This is not a one-sided problem. Candidates can=E2=80=99t tell which roles =
are real versus noise. Companies can=E2=80=99t tell which candidates are re=
al versus noise. We=E2=80=99re trying to solve a one-sided problem when it=
=E2=80=99s fundamentally a two-sided market failure.
From Credentialing to Verification
What I want to suggest here is that we need to move from a world where info=
rmation is cheap to produce for everybody to a world where we start to see =
verification instead of credentialing.
Credentialing is what we used to do. Credentialing is what a resume is for.=
 Credentialing is when we have certifications. Verification actually shows =
in a provable way that we have the skill.
I think we=E2=80=99re trying to make our little baby steps that way when we=
 talk about proving work through a portfolio. But we can go a lot farther t=
han that if we go back to first principles and actually reason this through=
=2E
Let me walk you through five principles for what a verification world looks=
 like. One of the hard things that has made it difficult to articulate this=
 is that a marketplace like the talent marketplace is sometimes stuck in a =
bad equilibrium where every single stakeholder has an incentive to change i=
t, but none of us can do it by ourselves.
I want to give you tools that work even in a difficult equilibrium like we=
=E2=80=99re in right now. The five principles that follow are scalable. The=
y work both in the current system and they have teeth that let you get into=
 a better equilibrium if we can all work together as a tech ecosystem.
Principle One: Process Over Outcome
Outcomes are more easily fakeable now. LLMs generate code, they generate wr=
iteups, they generate demos at scale. Process patterns are closer to that v=
erification world. Process patterns are hard to fake.
We look for them in interviews already. The iteration cycles you took to ge=
t something done. Where you got stuck. How you debugged some vibe code. Wha=
t you would do differently.
Effective LLM use, effective LLM building, effective LLM writing has a shap=
e. You iterate, you backtrack, you override. But it=E2=80=99s much, much ea=
sier to distinguish the shape of good LLM co-work versus blind acceptance.
One of the things that we should start thinking about is making our process=
 the product when it comes to the talent marketplace.
This has concrete implications for your portfolio. If you=E2=80=99re lookin=
g at your portfolio as an outcome, maybe you want to look at it as a proces=
s or a story that you=E2=80=99re telling where you include the debugging an=
d the getting stuck and what you=E2=80=99d do differently.
The most effective portfolio site I have ever seen told a full three-year s=
tory of a product. Every stage along the way was honest about mistakes, sho=
wed failed designs. It was absolutely compelling. The process matters more =
than the outcome, and you can=E2=80=99t fake the process the way you can fa=
ke the outcome in the age of AI.
For hiring managers, this means asking for work trails, not just outcomes. =
Look at commit history. Ask candidates to walk you through their decision-m=
aking, not just their final code. Ask them to record themselves solving a p=
roblem with narration about why they made specific choices.
Principle Two: Make Verification Easy, Not Signals Better
Companies don=E2=80=99t need better candidates, actually. Most of them have=
 all the candidates they need sitting in the applicant pool, as the applica=
nts will tell you. It=E2=80=99s that they can=E2=80=99t tell who=E2=80=99s =
real.
Stop optimizing for better resumes and shinier portfolios in that world bec=
ause the companies won=E2=80=99t be able to tell. Instead, start optimizing=
 for things that are more verifiable.
Work trials where you solved a real problem=E2=80=94paid, one to two weeks,=
 time-bounded, with clear success criteria. Live problem-solving videos whe=
re you record yourself solving a meaningful problem in real-time. No script=
, no polish, just thinking. Decision logs that document why you made specif=
ic choices, what alternatives you considered, and what trade-offs you accep=
ted.
By the way, as a hiring manager, you should be looking at work trials. That=
 is actually a good way to get a sense of how people work in this world and=
 it gives them something they can show.
What about live problem-solving? You can get on with a candidate and solve =
a problem together. That=E2=80=99s a great way to make this work as well. A=
nd if you=E2=80=99re a candidate, you don=E2=80=99t have to wait. You can l=
ive-solve a meaningful problem. I=E2=80=99ve seen people do it in videos wh=
ere they get on and they say, =E2=80=9CI took a look at your onboarding fun=
nel. These are the three things I think I=E2=80=99d change. This is why. Th=
is is how I=E2=80=99d change it. This is how I=E2=80=99d test it.=E2=80=9D
You=E2=80=99re showing that process and you=E2=80=99re sort of surfacing ve=
rification because one of the things companies want to do is this, but they=
 by and large don=E2=80=99t know how and they are stuck in the existing def=
ault circumstance. The goal is to shake up the status quo a little bit and =
get people thinking differently, because I think that both sides need to th=
ink differently to shake this equilibrium loose.
The winner isn=E2=80=99t who signals hardest. It=E2=80=99s who makes the hi=
ring decision easiest.
Principle Three: Use LLMs for Verification, Not Just Generation
This one=E2=80=99s important and I think it=E2=80=99s slept on. We=E2=80=99=
re using LLMs to produce cheap text=E2=80=94resumes, cover letters, portfol=
ios. This creates noise. But LLMs aren=E2=80=99t just content generators. T=
hey=E2=80=99re also judges, evaluators, researchers, and verifiers. They ca=
n assess judgment, grade the appropriateness of decisions, and generate ada=
ptive tests that extract maximum signal. We=E2=80=99re ignoring this capabi=
lity.
Think about it: a cryptographically signed LLM conversation shows your prom=
pt quality and your iteration pattern. You can=E2=80=99t fake that at scale=
=2E Now, you may not be able to cryp=
tographically sign it because I=E2=80=99m=
 not sure I know of a startup that does that yet. But you can still, right =
now, show your prompt quality and iteration pattern. Again, we=E2=80=99re g=
oing back to that process piece.
LLM-generated adaptive assessment finds your competence ceiling efficiently=
=2E What that means is you can actually=
 get the LLM to progressively test you=
 and ask you harder and harder questions. I wrote an AI fluency assessment =
just a few days ago on the Substack and it had some of that built into it, =
but you can go farther.
You can actually design an LLM competence assessment that asks harder and h=
arder questions as you go to eventually find where you top out. And I think=
 that=E2=80=99s actually useful not just for hiring managers to find signal=
, it=E2=80=99s also useful again on the process side for talent to show wha=
t you=E2=80=99re capable of.
If you can go through and you can take the hardest, most gnarly product man=
agement questions that an LLM can throw at you and answer them in a high-qu=
ality way after going through fifteen easy, medium, increasingly difficult =
ones, that says something=E2=80=94especially if you can see the whole proce=
ss, if you can see that you=E2=80=99re not gaming the system.
We are overdue for using LLMs to create signal where there just hasn=E2=80=
=99t been any signal whatsoever. We=E2=80=99re pouring all of this energy f=
or AI into making noise in a crowded, noisy marketplace, but there are quie=
t spaces where nobody=E2=80=99s talking at all. Why aren=E2=80=99t we using=
 AIs a little bit more creatively beyond just generating resumes and cover =
letters?
Here=E2=80=99s what this looks like practically: use semantic matching on c=
apability spaces rather than keywords. Match on problem types they need sol=
ved, not keywords in a job description. Build adaptive competence assessmen=
ts that test until failure. Show your LLM conversation trails=E2=80=94the p=
rompts, the iterations, where you overrode the model.
Principle Four: Bilateral Value Creation
You want to help companies verify themselves. I know this sounds funny if y=
ou=E2=80=99re talent=E2=80=94why do the companies need the help? But trust =
me, most companies do not know what they really need. They don=E2=80=99t. T=
hey=E2=80=99re posting LLM-generated job descriptions for fuzzy roles, and =
they need help to clarify in most cases.
You can interview them about the problem space. You can write analyses of t=
heir challenges. You can offer trials that validate their needs. I know peo=
ple who are doing this and are sort of taking command of the job process be=
cause the company is trying to figure out the answer and it feels really go=
od for them when a talented candidate comes along and says, =E2=80=9CLet me=
 help you get clarity on this role. This is what you actually need.=E2=80=
=9D
If you want a cheat code for more senior interviews, a lot of your senior i=
nterviews for director and up roles look like that because they=E2=80=99re =
all custom made. You end up in a place where you are helping the company to=
 figure out for both of you what the company really needs in the role and t=
hen secondarily whether you=E2=80=99re a fit.
In that situation, you=E2=80=99re not just proving your capability, you=E2=
=80=99re helping them understand what capability they are looking for. That=
 is the kind of value that an AI resume can=E2=80=99t give. That is the kin=
d of value that reminds them that you produce value that can=E2=80=99t be g=
otten from Claude or ChatGPT. It=E2=80=99s something that is essential in t=
he human-to-human connection of work, which by the way, lest we forget, is =
the whole point of all of this.
Here=E2=80=99s what this means practically: when you get that first call wi=
th a company, don=E2=80=99t lead with =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=
=99m qualified.=E2=80=9D Lead with =E2=80=9Clet me understand what you=E2=
=80=99re actually trying to solve.=E2=80=9D Interview them. Ask about their=
 pain points, their constraints, what they=E2=80=99ve tried before, why it =
didn=E2=80=99t work. Then send them a synthesis document that captures thei=
r problem space more clearly than they articulated it themselves.
That document is worth more than any resume. It shows strategic thinking, c=
ommunication skill, and genuine interest in solving their actual problem. M=
ost companies are drowning=E2=80=94they need help clarifying their own need=
s as much as they need help finding candidates.
Principle Five: Capability Spaces Over Job Titles
An AI PM means different things at different companies. We all know that, b=
ut we lack a vocabulary for the next level.
Job titles are often noise at this stage because the roles are evolving so =
quickly, and that=E2=80=99s part of what makes the talent marketplace so no=
isy. Instead of looking at all AI PM roles, position yourself across capabi=
lity spaces.
Think about technical communication. Maybe that=E2=80=99s a strength for yo=
u. Think about system design under situations of uncertainty. Think about L=
LM evaluation. Is that a skill that you have? Think about rapid prototyping=
=2E Build a project that works across m=
ultiple capabilities. Show your proces=
s. Match on problem types that they need to have solved.
One of the things that I think is actually really slept on is that we have =
semantic search available now that will allow you to match on much more tha=
n just keywords. And yet our entire job ecosystem still runs like the 2010s=
 on keywords. Why is that? Why can=E2=80=99t we have a job semantic search =
that matches not on keywords but on the capabilities, the themes?
It=E2=80=99s not that hard. There, you can actually build one yourself. If =
you wanted to do a project where you built a RAG and you could build out a =
listing of jobs in a particular job family, and you could semantically sear=
ch to see where the correct role targets are, all of the tech is on the tab=
le. That is basically a weekend project at this point.
You can transcend the title matching game entirely with work like that. And=
 the larger point, whether you want to build a RAG for your personal job se=
arch or whether I=E2=80=99m inspiring someone to do that, the larger point =
is this: think in capability spaces. Think in terms of what are the capabil=
ity sets you can show, how can you lay out that process really transparentl=
y, and then you can get into a space where you can start to show what you k=
now in a way that=E2=80=99s provable.
Here=E2=80=99s what this means practically: instead of targeting =E2=80=9CA=
I Product Manager=E2=80=9D roles, create a capability map. What problems ca=
n you solve? Technical communication to non-technical stakeholders. LLM eva=
luation methodology. Rapid prototyping in ambiguous domains. System design =
under uncertainty. Then build one project that demonstrates all of these. Y=
our portfolio becomes capability proof, not job title matching.
Why This Gets Better As The Market Gets Worse
As more LLMs create more noise, as the crowd runs to have LLMs generate res=
ume after resume, generate AI answers for interviews after AI answers for i=
nterviews, verification is only going to become more valuable, not less val=
uable.
The tactics I=E2=80=99m laying out here are designed to have increased retu=
rns. The more the market breaks, the bigger your advantage for making vetti=
ng easier because that is the core problem companies are facing.
I don=E2=80=99t want to give you principles here that require everyone who =
is listening to yell louder and compete with each other. Instead, I want to=
 give you things that let you zig when the market is zagging. And right now=
, the market is zagging hard toward yelling in a noisy marketplace with AI.
You are building with these kinds of moves toward a new equilibrium while e=
veryone else is clinging to the old one. And that gap is going to widen wit=
h time.
The LLM noise crisis is not going away. I said at the top, this is a perman=
ently broken system. It=E2=80=99s broken permanently not because of anybody=
=E2=80=99s bad intent, but because LLMs have permanently reset the cost of =
this kind of information to zero.
This is not really advice for navigating a broken system. It is positioning=
 you for the future system that will replace it, and it=E2=80=99s setting y=
ou up to work well even now in a system that is not quite ready to reach th=
at new equilibrium. It=E2=80=99s a principle for bridging. How can we succe=
ed now and zig while the market is zagging, and how can we build toward a b=
etter equilibrium?
What This Means For You Tomorrow
If you=E2=80=99re looking for work in AI, here=E2=80=99s where to start:
Pick one project you=E2=80=99ve built. Add decision logs showing your think=
ing=E2=80=94what you tried first, where you got stuck, what you=E2=80=99d d=
o differently. Record yourself walking through it for fifteen minutes, narr=
ating your trade-offs. Not a polished demo. A thinking-out-loud session.
Then identify one company you want to work with. Study their product, their=
 blog, their recent launches. Write a short analysis of their strategic cha=
llenge. Not a resume. Not a cover letter. An actual analysis that shows you=
 understand their problem space. Send it to them with an offer: =E2=80=9CHe=
re=E2=80=99s my thinking. If this resonates, I=E2=80=99d be happy to do a o=
ne-week paid trial on [specific problem].=E2=80=9D
That=E2=80=99s verifiable. That makes their vetting problem trivial. That p=
ositions you in Track One (high-trust) or Track Two (verification), not Tra=
ck Three (chaos).
If you=E2=80=99re hiring in AI, here=E2=80=99s where to start:
Stop optimizing job descriptions. Start documenting real problems you need =
solved. Not =E2=80=9CAI engineer with 5 years experience.=E2=80=9D But =E2=
=80=9CWe need someone who can build LLM evaluation frameworks for ambiguous=
 product requirements. Here=E2=80=99s the current situation, here=E2=80=99s=
 what we=E2=80=99ve tried, here=E2=80=99s what we need.=E2=80=9D
Then structure your hiring around verification, not credentialing. Offer pa=
id trials=E2=80=94one to two weeks, clear deliverable, real problem. Ask fo=
r work trails in portfolios=E2=80=94commit history, decision documentation,=
 evidence of iteration. Use live problem-solving sessions instead of whiteb=
oard interviews. Watch how candidates think, not what they produce.
And be honest about what you don=E2=80=99t know. Most companies posting =E2=
=80=9CAI PM=E2=80=9D roles don=E2=80=99t actually know what they need. Say =
that. =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re figuring this out. If you can help us clarify =
what this role should be, that=E2=80=99s valuable.=E2=80=9D The candidates =
who can do that are the ones you want anyway.
The Bottom Line
Information became free in the last two years. Verification became priceles=
s.
The job market isn=E2=80=99t coming back to the old equilibrium. The compan=
ies that figure out verification first will have ten-times better hiring ou=
tcomes. The candidates who make verification easy will bypass the noise eve=
ryone else is drowning in. The platforms that build verification infrastruc=
ture will capture the market.
Everyone else is still playing the old game, which is already over.
Think about that.

Problem: AI Made Signals Free (And Worthless)</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The job mark=
et used to work because signals were expensive to produce.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
A resume took time. A good, customized resume took more time. Cover letters=
 required genuine thought. I used to be able to read a resume and sense the=
 effort behind it. The cost worked because it separated signal from noise. =
Strong candidates could afford the effort to customize applications because=
 their returns were higher. Weak candidates faced diseconomies of scale=E2=
=80=94each additional application was nearly as costly as the first.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">AI has collapsed that cost to zero.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When you can =
write a perfect resume in three minutes and pump out ten different custom r=
esumes at zero marginal cost, there is no information in that signal. The f=
ancy word for this is Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is playing out in la=
bor markets. The less fancy way of saying it is that because it doesn=E2=80=
=99t cost anything to make information, that information loses signal value=
 in hiring, and we=E2=80=99re all in trouble.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

s what we feel, right?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s in=
teresting: we mostly talk about this from the talent side. A thousand appli=
cations per job sucks for everybody. The problem is, both sides right now t=
end to give advice that creates more noise to cut the noise. Yell louder. P=
ut a portfolio out there. Build a social media presence. Post more job desc=
riptions if you=E2=80=99re a hiring manager. It all adds up to this cacopho=
ny of noise in the AI job market.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">What I want to suggest to=
 you is that the information equilibrium that existed before 2022 is perman=

oise level and break through with signal. Weak candidates faced limitations=
 with their ability to actually put the effort in and generate quality work=
. LLMs have destroyed the value of effort from good candidates, and they ma=
ke it equally cheap for everyone to produce infinite signals.</p><p style=

change it, but none of us can do it by ourselves.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 =

Three: Use LLMs for Verification, Not Just Generation</h2><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This=
 one=E2=80=99s important and I think it=E2=80=99s slept on. We=E2=80=99re u=
sing LLMs to produce cheap text=E2=80=94resumes, cover letters, portfolios.=
 This creates noise. But LLMs aren=E2=80=99t just content generators. They=
=E2=80=99re also judges, evaluators, researchers, and verifiers. They can a=
ssess judgment, grade the appropriateness of decisions, and generate adapti=
ve tests that extract maximum signal. We=E2=80=99re ignoring this capabilit=
y.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Think about it: a cryptographically signed LLM conversat=
ion shows your prompt quality and your iteration pattern. You can=E2=80=99t=
 fake that at scale. Now, you may not be able to cryptographically sign it =
because I=E2=80=99m not sure I know of a startup that does that yet. But yo=
u can still, right now, show your prompt quality and iteration pattern. Aga=
in, we=E2=80=99re going back to that process piece.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">LLM-gen=
erated adaptive assessment finds your competence ceiling efficiently. What =
that means is you can actually get the LLM to progressively test you and as=
k you harder and harder questions. I wrote an AI fluency assessment just a =
few days ago on the Substack and it had some of that built into it, but you=
 can go farther.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You can actually design an LLM competence =
assessment that asks harder and harder questions as you go to eventually fi=
nd where you top out. And I think that=E2=80=99s actually useful not just f=
or hiring managers to find signal, it=E2=80=99s also useful again on the pr=
ocess side for talent to show what you=E2=80=99re capable of.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">If you can go through and you can take the hardest, most gnarly produc=
t management questions that an LLM can throw at you and answer them in a hi=
gh-quality way after going through fifteen easy, medium, increasingly diffi=
cult ones, that says something=E2=80=94especially if you can see the whole =
process, if you can see that you=E2=80=99re not gaming the system.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=

n=E2=80=99t been any signal whatsoever. We=E2=80=99re pouring all of this e=
nergy for AI into making noise in a crowded, noisy marketplace, but there a=

p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">You want to help companies verify themselves. I know this sound=
s funny if you=E2=80=99re talent=E2=80=94why do the companies need the help=
? But trust me, most companies do not know what they really need. They don=
=E2=80=99t. They=E2=80=99re posting LLM-generated job descriptions for fuzz=
y roles, and they need help to clarify in most cases.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You c=
an interview them about the problem space. You can write analyses of their =
challenges. You can offer trials that validate their needs. I know people w=
ho are doing this and are sort of taking command of the job process because=
 the company is trying to figure out the answer and it feels really good fo=
r them when a talented candidate comes along and says, =E2=80=9CLet me help=
 you get clarity on this role. This is what you actually need.=E2=80=9D</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">If you want a cheat code for more senior interviews, a lot of =
your senior interviews for director and up roles look like that because the=
y=E2=80=99re all custom made. You end up in a place where you are helping t=
he company to figure out for both of you what the company really needs in t=
he role and then secondarily whether you=E2=80=99re a fit.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
In that situation, you=E2=80=99re not just proving your capability, you=E2=
=80=99re helping them understand what capability they are looking for. That=
 is the kind of value that an AI resume can=E2=80=99t give. That is the kin=
d of value that reminds them that you produce value that can=E2=80=99t be g=
otten from Claude or ChatGPT. It=E2=80=99s something that is essential in t=
he human-to-human connection of work, which by the way, lest we forget, is =
the whole point of all of this.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=

an they articulated it themselves.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">That document is worth m=
ore than any resume. It shows strategic thinking, communication skill, and =
genuine interest in solving their actual problem. Most companies are drowni=

 Over Job Titles</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=

l.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">Job titles are often noise at this stage because the rol=
es are evolving so quickly, and that=E2=80=99s part of what makes the talen=
t marketplace so noisy. Instead of looking at all AI PM roles, position you=
rself across capability spaces.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think about technical commu=
nication. Maybe that=E2=80=99s a strength for you. Think about system desig=
n under situations of uncertainty. Think about LLM evaluation. Is that a sk=
ill that you have? Think about rapid prototyping. Build a project that work=
s across multiple capabilities. Show your process. Match on problem types t=
hat they need to have solved.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">One of the things that I thin=
k is actually really slept on is that we have semantic search available now=
 that will allow you to match on much more than just keywords. And yet our =
entire job ecosystem still runs like the 2010s on keywords. Why is that? Wh=
y can=E2=80=99t we have a job semantic search that matches not on keywords =
but on the capabilities, the themes?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It=E2=80=99s not that =
hard. There, you can actually build one yourself. If you wanted to do a pro=
ject where you built a RAG and you could build out a listing of jobs in a p=
articular job family, and you could semantically search to see where the co=
rrect role targets are, all of the tech is on the table. That is basically =
a weekend project at this point.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You can transcend the titl=
e matching game entirely with work like that. And the larger point, whether=
 you want to build a RAG for your personal job search or whether I=E2=80=99=
m inspiring someone to do that, the larger point is this: think in capabili=
ty spaces. Think in terms of what are the capability sets you can show, how=
 can you lay out that process really transparently, and then you can get in=
to a space where you can start to show what you know in a way that=E2=80=99=
s provable.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here=E2=80=99s what this means practically: ins=
tead of targeting =E2=80=9CAI Product Manager=E2=80=9D roles, create a capa=
bility map. What problems can you solve? Technical communication to non-tec=
hnical stakeholders. LLM evaluation methodology. Rapid prototyping in ambig=
uous domains. System design under uncertainty. Then build one project that =
demonstrates all of these. Your portfolio becomes capability proof, not job=
 title matching.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: rel=
