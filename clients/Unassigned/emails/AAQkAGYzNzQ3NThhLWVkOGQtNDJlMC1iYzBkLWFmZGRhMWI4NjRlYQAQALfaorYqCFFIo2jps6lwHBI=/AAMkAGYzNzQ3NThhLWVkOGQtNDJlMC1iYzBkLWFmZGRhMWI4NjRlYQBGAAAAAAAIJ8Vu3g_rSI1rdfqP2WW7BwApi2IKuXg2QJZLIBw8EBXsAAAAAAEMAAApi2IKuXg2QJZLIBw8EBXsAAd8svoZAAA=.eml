GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: ON HUMAN NATURE AND TAKING THE US SERIOUSLY [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
_Question: It is constantly perplexing that human beings don’t seem to have learnt much over thousands of years. Sure, there have seen advancements in almost every aspect of life that are supposed
to make our future brighter with less exertion. What happened to getting along with one another, helping each other out, forging a better world for those that will follow us? GPF’s recent paper
“Reviving NATO’s Eastern Line [4],” while understandable because of Russia’s aggressive stance, must be of concern to the average citizen of all those countries. And in that case, isn’t it
because of Putin, one man’s ego, not a threat by Russian people generally? _
Response: The circumstances around humans may evolve, but our nature remains intact. From the geopolitical point of view, the two dimensions of humanity are greed and fear. We have deep desires and we
have deep fears. What is true for individuals is true for communities, from families to nations, which fear the intentions of other nations and seek to satisfy their own needs. These passions are
embedded in us because they are passions necessary to life. I borrow this concept from Aristotle and Warren Buffett, men smarter than me. Much changes, but not the fundamental reality and nature of
human beings.
-------------------------
_Question: The most advanced weapon systems are incredibly expensive and take a long time to construct. After a war between great powers – say, America and China – both sides would take years to
replace their losses in ships, aircraft, etc. During that time, their ability to project power would be greatly reduced, and they would become vulnerable to other threats. The enormous cost of
rearmament might also lead to domestic political unrest as funding was diverted away from other concerns. Doesn’t this create a significant deterrent to direct conflict between great powers even
when there is no fear of nuclear war?_
Response: Apparently not, given the fairly widespread presence of war today (with the most modern weapon systems available at this time) and in the past. Economics is the dimension of wealth and
poverty. War is a matter of life and death and, in a way, determines the nature of the economy of nations. Losing a war is far more economically painful than winning one.
-------------------------
_Question: What is the biggest geopolitical challenge for the U.S.? Could the U.S. deal with Russia include their retiring from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua?_
Response: The primary geopolitical problem for the United States from my point of view is avoiding entanglement in conflicts that are not significantly of interest to the United States. For the past
80 years, the U.S. has engaged in several conflicts that it lost, without suffering significant consequences from the defeat, such as in Vietnam and Afghanistan. To me that indicates that the United
States has not been prudent in choosing its conflicts. As to the specifics mentioned in the question, none of these issues are of profound interest to the United States, and the risk of involvement
and the costs they might impose is greater than the benefits. So to me the most important thing is to reorganize our thinking of U.S. geopolitical interests. I don’t think that the Russians are now
much involved with any of these three countries (Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua), although they definitely were during the Cold War. I wrote last week of calibrating risks and capabilities with U.S.
interest in Ukraine [5].
-------------------------
_Question: No prime ministers or presidents of other states in the world are taking Mr. Trump’s speeches seriously any longer, especially because in two or three weeks he will give a different
version. Isn’t it likely that Mr. Putin has studied the psychology of Mr. Trump to deceive him on a repeated basis and to pursue his goal to build up a New Yalta, to put the USA aside (famous
decline of American Empire)? _
Response: The nations of the world are taking what Donald Trump says very seriously because they must. The reason is that the United States is a very powerful country economically and militarily. They
cannot avoid a deep interest in what the United States will do because even U.S. indifference can have an effect on many nations. The unreliability of Trump’s statements increases the anxiety of
other nations, but it does not diminish the care and even urgency they must have in dealing with the United States. Unpredictability of the powerful makes others more, not less, thoughtful.
-------------------------
_Question: For Beijing, deepening Shanghai Cooperation Organization trade ties is a path to expand infrastructure, grow exports in renewables and tech, and offset U.S. tariffs. Xi Jinping announced
new initiatives in energy, green industry and digital tech, while promoting greater Global South representation. Is Xi using this to present China as a stable alternative to U.S. trade tensions and
shape the future of Eurasian trade?_
Response: China is the world's second largest economy, but its per capita GDP is 69th. Given its population, China is still a poor country with limited internal demand. China cannot sell all it
produces inside of China. At this point Russia cannot afford to import much from China, while India is itself competing with China for export markets. On the other hand, U.S. GDP represents 25 percent
of the world’s economy, and even with the desire to reduce the amount it imports, it is still of necessity a massive importer. So China badly needs access to the U.S. market. No other country can
satisfy Chinese exporting requirements, and trying to export to many nations to make up for declining exports to the United States is not easy. But a smart businessman never admits that he badly needs
to make a sale. So the SCO show was produced, replete with masses of soldiers totally irrelevant to China’s economic problems, and actually a drain.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The circ=
umstances around humans may evolve, but our nature remains intact. From the=
 geopolitical point of view, the two dimensions of humanity are greed and f=
ear. We have deep desires and we have deep fears. What is true for individu=
als is true for communities, from families to nations, which fear the inten=
tions of other nations and seek to satisfy their own needs. These passions =
are embedded in us because they are passions necessary to life. I borrow th=
is concept from Aristotle and Warren Buffett, men smarter than me. Much cha=
nges, but not the fundamental reality and nature of human beings.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: The =
most advanced weapon systems are incredibly expensive and take a long time =
to construct. After a war between great powers =E2=80=93 say, America and C=
hina =E2=80=93 both sides would take years to replace their losses in ships=
, aircraft, etc. During that time, their ability to project power would be =
greatly reduced, and they would become vulnerable to other threats. The eno=
rmous cost of rearmament might also lead to domestic political unrest as fu=
nding was diverted away from other concerns. Doesn=E2=80=99t this create a =
significant deterrent to direct conflict between great powers even when the=
re is no fear of nuclear war?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Apparent=
ly not, given the fairly widespread presence of war today (with the most mo=
dern weapon systems available at this time) and in the past. Economics is t=
he dimension of wealth and poverty. War is a matter of life and death and, =
in a way, determines the nature of the economy of nations. Losing a war is =
far more economically painful than winning one.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: What=
 is the biggest geopolitical challenge for the U.S.? Could the U.S. deal wi=
th Russia include their retiring from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua?</em></=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The prim=
ary geopolitical problem for the United States from my point of view is avo=
iding entanglement in conflicts that are not significantly of interest to t=
he United States. For the past 80 years, the U.S. has engaged in several co=
nflicts that it lost, without suffering significant consequences from the d=
efeat, such as in Vietnam and Afghanistan. To me that indicates that the Un=
ited States has not been prudent in choosing its conflicts. As to the speci=
fics mentioned in the question, none of these issues are of profound intere=
st to the United States, and the risk of involvement and the costs they mig=
ht impose is greater than the benefits. So to me the most important thing i=
s to reorganize our thinking of U.S. geopolitical interests. I don=E2=80=99=
t think that the Russians are now much involved with any of these three cou=
ntries (Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua), although they definitely were durin=
g the Cold War. I wrote last week of <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: No p=
rime ministers or presidents of other states in the world are taking Mr. Tr=
ump=E2=80=99s speeches seriously any longer, especially because in two or t=
hree weeks he will give a different version. Isn=E2=80=99t it likely that M=
r. Putin has studied the psychology of Mr. Trump to deceive him on a repeat=
ed basis and to pursue his goal to build up a New Yalta, to put the USA asi=
de (famous decline of American Empire)? </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The nati=
ons of the world are taking what Donald Trump says very seriously because t=
hey must. The reason is that the United States is a very powerful country e=
conomically and militarily. They cannot avoid a deep interest in what the U=
nited States will do because even U.S. indifference can have an effect on m=
any nations. The unreliability of Trump=E2=80=99s statements increases the =
anxiety of other nations, but it does not diminish the care and even urgenc=
y they must have in dealing with the United States. Unpredictability of the=
 powerful makes others more, not less, thoughtful.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: For =
Beijing, deepening Shanghai Cooperation Organization trade ties is a path t=
o expand infrastructure, grow exports in renewables and tech, and offset U.=
S. tariffs. Xi Jinping announced new initiatives in energy, green industry =
and digital tech, while promoting greater Global South representation. Is X=
i using this to present China as a stable alternative to U.S. trade tension=
s and shape the future of Eurasian trade?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: China is=
 the world's second largest economy, but its per capita GDP is 69th. Given =
its population, China is still a poor country with limited internal demand.=
 China cannot sell all it produces inside of China. At this point Russia ca=
nnot afford to import much from China, while India is itself competing with=
 China for export markets. On the other hand, U.S. GDP represents 25 percen=
t of the world=E2=80=99s economy, and even with the desire to reduce the am=
ount it imports, it is still of necessity a massive importer. So China badl=
y needs access to the U.S. market. No other country can satisfy Chinese exp=
orting requirements, and trying to export to many nations to make up for de=
clining exports to the United States is not easy. But a smart businessman n=
ever admits that he badly needs to make a sale. So the SCO show was produce=
d, replete with masses of soldiers totally irrelevant to China=E2=80=99s ec=
onomic problems, and actually a drain.</p>
