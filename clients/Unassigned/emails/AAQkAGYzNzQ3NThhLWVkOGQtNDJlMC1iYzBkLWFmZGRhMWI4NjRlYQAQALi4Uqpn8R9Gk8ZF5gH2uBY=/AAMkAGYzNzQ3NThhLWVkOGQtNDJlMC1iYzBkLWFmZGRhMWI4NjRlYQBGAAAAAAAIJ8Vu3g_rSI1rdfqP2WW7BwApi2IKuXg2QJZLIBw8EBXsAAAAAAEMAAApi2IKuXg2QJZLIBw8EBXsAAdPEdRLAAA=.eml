I keep getting the same DM: "How do I actually understand AI before it's to=
o late?"
This piece answers that question. Completely.
Why now? Everyone can feel it=E2=80=94GPT-5 is coming this summer, and with=
 it, a fundamental shift in what AI can do. Sam Altman's promise of "one mo=
del that just works" isn't just marketing. It's likely going to be a reset =
moment for anyone trying to keep up.
Here's what hit me while writing this: This is a summer of consolidation. W=
hether we believe GPT-5 is the be-all OpenAI promises or not, the movement =
of the major model makers is unmistakably accelerating. We=E2=80=99re seein=
g fractured progress consolidate into something qualitatively different. No=
t just bigger models, but unified experiences. Not just smarter answers, bu=
t reliable enterprise-grade solutions. It makes me think back to 2007=E2=80=
=A6this summer feels a bit like the year the iPhone released. In the same w=
ay the iPhone wasn't just a better BlackBerry, 2025 AI models are going to =
make 2023 and 2024 models look outdated. Just a couple of years in, AI itse=
lf is going through a platform shift.
So yes, in this ~22 page post I'll tell you everything we know about GPT-5 =
first (because I'm impatient too). The summer 2025 target, the model unific=
ation, the capacity bottlenecks, why OpenAI keeps pushing the date=E2=80=94=
it's all here. Consider it a brief that cuts through the rumor mill and get=
s you grounded before we dive deeper.
And yes, we will dive deeper! It=E2=80=99s summer and you need a beach read=
 right?! Understanding what's coming in the second half of the year really =
means understanding how we got here. And I get it, that has not been easy! =
It=E2=80=99s been like, go dig up these 15 esoteric articles. Then it=E2=80=
=99s up to you to make sense of all of it.
Nope. That sucks. Not anymore. Now you get one easy place to get a very cle=
ar summary of what AI actually is, how we got generative AI and (yes) who I=
 follow to keep up with the latest on AI. Really.
And it=E2=80=99s all very readable, with your handy links to a whole course=
 worth of follow-up material. I=E2=80=99m not kidding. If you read up on th=
e 11 voices I list here plus the 7 AI resources I call out you will without=
 a doubt be better informed than 99% of the global population on AI.=20
And they=E2=80=99re not even that heavy. You skip one good doom-scrolling s=
esh a day for a few weeks and you are there. Promise. And even if you don=
=E2=80=99t and you just read this post, you=E2=80=99re gonna understand AI =
better than most people out there. I=E2=80=99ve made it that accessible.
So what=E2=80=99s in the =E2=80=9Cget ready for ChatGPT-5=E2=80=9D box anyw=
ay? So glad you asked. I've structured this guide in four parts:
First, everything we know about ChatGPT-5=E2=80=94the specs, the delays, th=
e strategic implications. For those who need to know what's coming before t=
hey'll invest in understanding how it works.
Second, the story of AI told in a way that actually makes sense=E2=80=94how=
 we went from spam filters to ChatGPT, told without the jargon. This is the=
 foundation most people skip, then wonder why AI feels like magic.
Third, seven carefully selected resources that take you from total beginner=
 to genuinely understanding modern AI. Yes, including building your own GPT=
=2E These aren't random YouTube vide=
os=E2=80=94these seven are a curated path=
 I=E2=80=99ve seen laid out nowhere else. I=E2=80=99ve created the lesson g=
uide on AI I wish existed on the internet.
Fourth, my personal list of 11 people who consistently deliver signal over =
noise. When ChatGPT-5 drops and everyone has opinions, these are the voices=
 that will actually matter. Honestly, follow them regardless of what OpenAI=
 does, because these 11 together will tell you where the future is going.
So there you go! Whether you're a founder trying to position for the post-C=
hatGPT-5 world, a PM wondering if AI agents really will "join the workforce=
" this year, a leader trying to skill up on AI, or (like most of us) just s=
omeone who refuses to be left behind=E2=80=94this is your starting point.
The clock is ticking. Summer is here and this is the beach read you=E2=80=
=99ve been waiting for lol
Let's start with what everyone wants to know: Everything we know about Chat=
GPT-5...
Subscribers get all these pieces!
I=E2=80=99m impatient, tell me everything we know about GPT-5 first lol
1.=E2=80=82A moving=E2=80=94but still =E2=80=9Csummer=E2=80=9D 2025=E2=80=
=94target
In a mid-June interview, CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 is =E2=80=9Cbeing prepar=
ed for public release,=E2=80=9D but only after it clears internal benchmark=
s; if those aren=E2=80=99t met, launch will slip. For now he still hopes fo=
r =E2=80=9Csometime in summer=E2=80=9D 2025, yet he would not name a specif=
ic day.
Just two months earlier Altman posted on X that OpenAI was pausing GPT-5 to=
 ship interim o-series updates; he cited integration headaches and capacity=
 limits behind recent outages and promised =E2=80=9Ca few months=E2=80=9D o=
f extra polish before the big release. TechRadar covered the statement, put=
ting the revised window in early Q3.
Taken together, the comments show an organization still calibrating both mo=
del quality and infrastructure load before flipping the switch, although th=
e rumors are building that July is the month [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/30301a70-b61e-4ba2-a4e1-d5c704bf5d6b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmL=
QJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
2.=E2=80=82From many SKUs to =E2=80=9Cone model that just works=E2=80=9D
OpenAI=E2=80=99s public roadmap now frames GPT-5 as a unification layer. A =
February note to higher-ed IT leaders explained that the company has scrapp=
ed a standalone o3 model and will instead fold every internal architecture=
=E2=80=94o-series reasoning, GPT-4-family general knowledge, voice, and dee=
p-search tools=E2=80=94into a single API and ChatGPT brain. Sam claims to =
=E2=80=9Chate the model picker as much as you do=E2=80=9D and is questing t=
o return to =E2=80=9Cmagic unified intelligence.=E2=80=9D
Product-line simplification matters because each extra dial in ChatGPT incr=
eases cognitive load and undermines the promise of friction-free AI. I pers=
onally get a LOT of DMs that amount to which model and I think OpenAI knows=
 that solving that alone is probably worth billions. GPT-5 is therefore pos=
itioned less as =E2=80=9Ca bigger network=E2=80=9D and more as a platform r=
eset where routing between lightweight and heavyweight experts happens invi=
sibly. That is a very hard problem, so we shall see how they do.
3.=E2=80=82Capability gains OpenAI is willing to promise
What will the next system actually do better? While OpenAI avoids hard spec=
s in advance, Sam=E2=80=99s public remarks with Bill Gates way back in earl=
y 2024 outline the yard-sticks OpenAI still expects to improve (think of th=
ese as part of the longterm vision of the company=E2=80=94the invisible rai=

4.=E2=80=82Engineering realities driving the delay
It takes a lot of chips to serve a big model to the world guys. Sam=E2=80=
=99s walk-it-back April tweet blamed two concrete bottlenecks:
System integration =E2=80=93 Merging o-series structured reasoning with GPT=
-style open-ended generation proved harder than expected.
Capacity planning =E2=80=93 GPT-4o launches triggered large-scale service i=
nterruptions, revealing that OpenAI still needs headroom before inviting th=
e whole world to hammer a larger model.
Although neither OpenAI nor Microsoft has published compute budgets (don=E2=

es to capacity echo Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang=E2=80=99s estimate that frontie=
r models will soon require tens of thousands of H100-class GPUs. Whether GP=
T-5 ultimately uses 50 K GPUs or something larger remains unconfirmed, but =
the supply-chain and energy costs are clearly top-of-mind.
5.=E2=80=82Alignment research continues in parallel
OpenAI=E2=80=99s June safety bulletin analyzes =E2=80=9Cemergent misalignme=
nt=E2=80=9D in GPT-4o and proposes auditing internal activations to catch b=
ad personas early. The paper shows that fine-tuning on even one narrow doma=

t also that targeted retraining can reverse it. These interpretability tool=

Reading between the lines, GPT-5 will likely bake in such real-time alignme=

atGPT. The headline is that capability and safety work are proceeding toget=
her; neither will ship without the other meeting internal criteria, which a=
gain explains the sliding launch date.
6.=E2=80=82What isn=E2=80=99t verified yet
Parameter count or context window =E2=80=93 No official numbers. Rumors ran=

Pricing tiers =E2=80=93 Sam wants these models to be as free as possible, p=

7.=E2=80=82Strategic takeaways for builders
Expect smoother UX, not just bigger brains =E2=80=93 The unification push s=

Plan for gradual rollout =E2=80=93 If GPT-5=E2=80=99s release hinges on int=
ernal scorecards, OpenAI may stage access (Pro first, Plus later, free tier=

Monitor alignment tooling =E2=80=93 The misalignment research points to ric=

ers to audit model behavior=E2=80=94something to integrate into governance =
frameworks early.
Watch compute supply chains =E2=80=93 Any organization betting on custom GP=

For AI builders and business leaders, the clearest lesson is to prepare for=

While I wait: So what is AI, anyway?

urn words into intelligence.

 about GPT-5. More importantly, you'll have the foundation to actually use =
these tools, not just marvel at them.
So what is AI, anyway? So glad you asked! Gather round the LLM campfire and=
 roast some delicious inference-driven s'mores=E2=80=A6Here's the story of =
how we got to generative AI and ChatGPT, one regression at a time=E2=80=A6
From Classic Machine Learning to LLMs
In the early 2000s =E2=80=9Cmachine learning=E2=80=9D usually meant telling=
 an algorithm which details of the data mattered. Only us geeks cared back =
then lol.
A spam filter, for example, might count exclamation marks, odd sender domai=
ns, or the word =E2=80=9CViagra=E2=80=9D (I MEAN YES). Anyway, Engineers en=
coded those counts into fixed-length tables, then trained relatively small =
models=E2=80=94logistic regression, decision trees, support-vector machines=
=E2=80=94to separate =E2=80=9Cspam=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=9Cham.=E2=80=9D Thi=
s approach worked, but every new problem demanded fresh feature engineering=
=2E Success depended less on the algori=
thm itself than on human intuition abo=
ut what features to feed it.
Around 2012, three forces flipped that script: (1) cheap parallel GPUs; (2)=
 huge labeled datasets such as ImageNet; and (3) deeper neural networks tha=
t could learn features automatically. In computer vision, convolutional net=
s discovered edges, textures, and shapes without being told what a =E2=80=
=9Ccorner=E2=80=9D looked like. Natural-language research soon followed. Wo=
rd2Vec (2013) showed that a network trained to predict nearby words produce=
d surprisingly rich word vectors=E2=80=94embeddings=E2=80=94where basic ari=
thmetic captured semantic relationships: king =E2=88=92 man + woman =E2=89=
=88 queen. For the first time, representations of meaning emerged directly =
from data instead of manual rules.
Yet early language nets processed text sequentially. Recurrent neural netwo=
rks (RNNs) and LSTMs read one token at a time, passing hidden states forwar=
d like whispered secrets. They captured local context, but struggled with l=
ong sentences; gradients vanished, training crawled. Researchers added hack=
s=E2=80=94attention mechanisms, residual connections=E2=80=94but bottleneck=
s remained.
Everything changed in 2017 with the paper =E2=80=9CAttention Is All You Nee=
d [ https://substack.com/redirect/f3542bab-b141-4a51-94e3-38dad6d73264?j=3D=
eyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].=E2=80=9D=
 The authors discarded recurrence and built the transformer, an architectur=
e that looks at every token in parallel while assigning =E2=80=9Cattention =
weights=E2=80=9D that signal how strongly each token relates to every other=
=2E Parallelization let the model scale=
 across thousands of GPUs; attention l=
et it track long-range dependencies (Who did what to whom three clauses ago=
?). The transformer quickly dominated translation, summarization, and quest=
ion-answering benchmarks.
At the same time, two macro trends accelerated progress:
Self-supervised learning. Instead of hand-labeling examples, researchers tr=
ained models to fill in blanks=E2=80=94mask a word, predict the next token,=
 reconstruct a shuffled sentence. Because the supervision signal is the dat=
a, corpora could grow from millions to trillions of tokens.
Scaling laws. Experiments showed that performance improves predictably as y=
ou scale data, parameters, and compute together. Bigger wasn=E2=80=99t just=
 better; it was reliably, quantifiably better. That discovery encouraged la=
bs to invest in ever-larger clusters and datasets, culminating in models wi=
th hundreds of billions (now trillions) of parameters: Large Language Model=
s.
LLMs use the transformer backbone, train on diverse internet-scale text, an=
d optimize a simple objective=E2=80=94minimize the error when predicting th=
e next token. That single goal forces the network to internalize grammar, f=
acts, reasoning patterns, and even domain knowledge. Once training is done,=
 additional steps=E2=80=94supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning fr=
om human feedback, tool integration=E2=80=94reshape the raw predictor into =
a conversational assistant that follows instructions and avoids unsafe cont=
ent.
In short, the journey from classic ML to LLMs is a story of abstraction and=
 scale. We moved from hand-designed features plus modest algorithms to self=
-learning representations plus massive transformers. Hardware speed, data a=
vailability, and theoretical insights into scaling combined to turn the hum=
ble task of next-word prediction into a general platform for language under=
standing and generation=E2=80=94making today=E2=80=99s AI assistants possib=
le.
Now: How Large Language Models Turn Text Into Intelligence
Why prediction is powerful
When people hear that ChatGPT or another large language model (LLM) is =E2=
=80=9Cjust predicting the next word,=E2=80=9D it sounds almost trivial=E2=
=80=94how could that produce essays, code, jokes, or business plans?=20
The trick is scale and structure. By training on gigantic amounts of text, =
an LLM learns the statistical fingerprints of language: grammar, facts, rea=
soning patterns, even cultural style. At run-time it doesn=E2=80=99t look u=
p an answer in a database; instead it builds the answer token-by-token, eac=
h choice conditioned on everything typed so far. Because the model has inge=
sted trillions of examples, these conditional probabilities encode an enorm=
ous amount of knowledge.=20
To understand how that works in practice, we need to follow four main steps=
: (1) turning words into numbers, (2) passing those numbers through a trans=
former network, (3) training the network at massive scale, and (4) guiding =
the finished model so it behaves safely and helpfully.
From words to numbers=E2=80=94the key is embeddings=20
Computers don=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cknow=E2=80=9D words; they know numbers. So=
 the first job is to convert text into a form math can handle. LLMs break t=
ext into tokens=E2=80=94chunks that are usually whole words but can be sub-=
words (=E2=80=9Cun-=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cbreak=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cable=E2=80=
=9D) or even punctuation. Each token gets mapped to a high-dimensional vect=
or called an embedding. Think of an embedding as a coordinate in a systems =
that captures meaning: =E2=80=9Ccat=E2=80=9D lands near =E2=80=9Ckitten,=E2=
=80=9D far from =E2=80=9Cdemocracy=E2=80=9D (well, until we run a cat for p=
resident). These coordinates aren=E2=80=99t assigned by humans; they are le=
arned during training so that tokens that appear in similar contexts end up=
 close together.
Why vectors? Because they let the model use linear algebra to measure simil=
arity, combine ideas, and move through the =E2=80=9Csemantic space=E2=80=9D=
 of language. If you=E2=80=99ve heard the analogy =E2=86=92 king =E2=80=93 =
man + woman =E2=89=88 queen, that=E2=80=99s a real arithmetic operation on =
embeddings. By the time training is finished, the embedding layer has becom=
e a compressed encyclopedia of word-level knowledge, packaged in pure numbe=
rs.
The transformer engine=E2=80=94attention is all you need=20
Once the tokens are vectors, they pass into the heart of the model: a trans=
former. Introduced by Google in 2017, the transformer replaced older recurr=
ent networks by processing all tokens in parallel and letting them =E2=80=
=9Cpay attention=E2=80=9D to one another.
Each transformer layer contains two key pieces:
Self-attention: For every token, the model computes how strongly it should =
attend to every other token in the current context window. The famous =E2=
=80=9Cscaled dot-product attention=E2=80=9D takes the query vector for toke=
n i and measures its similarity to key vectors for all tokens, yielding wei=
ghts. These weights say, in effect, =E2=80=9Chow relevant is every other wo=
rd to me?=E2=80=9D The model then builds a weighted average of value vector=
s, giving token i a focused, context-aware representation. Multiple attenti=
on =E2=80=9Cheads=E2=80=9D look for different patterns simultaneously=E2=80=
=94syntax, coreference, timeline cues, etc.
Feed-forward network: After attention mixes information, a small neural net=
work within the layer transforms each token independently, adding non-linea=
r depth.
Stack sixty-plus layers and you get a deep hierarchy that can capture compl=
ex dependencies that underly natural language=E2=80=94like why =E2=80=9Cban=
k=E2=80=9D means money in one sentence and river edge in another. Crucially=
, the transformer is position-aware, so word order matters. The result of t=
he final layer is a new vector for every token, now rich with global contex=
t.
Training=E2=80=94reading the Internet (and textbooks, and code, and academi=
c journals, and textbooks, and and and=E2=80=A6)
Training an LLM is like teaching a teenager by giving them the world=E2=80=
=99s library and asking them to guess the next word in every sentence=E2=80=
=94over and over, billions of times. Concretely training has four big parts=
:
Objective: Minimize cross-entropy loss between the model=E2=80=99s predicte=
d probability distribution for the next token and the actual next token in =
the text.
Data: Web pages, books, news, research papers, open-source code, dialogue t=
ranscripts, and curated =E2=80=9Chigh-quality=E2=80=9D datasets. Copyright =
filtering, deduplication, and data cleaning matter because noisy text teach=
es bad habits.
Scale: Models such as GPT-4o or Gemini Ultra see trillions of tokens. They =
train on clusters with thousands of GPUs for weeks. More data and more para=
meters tend to improve performance roughly log-linearly=E2=80=94a phenomeno=
n called the =E2=80=9Cscaling laws.=E2=80=9D
Optimization: Stochastic gradient descent tweaks billions (or now trillions=
) of weight parameters. Mixed-precision math and optimizer tricks (AdamW, m=
omentum, learning-rate warm-up) keep the process stable.
All the model ever sees is a giant fill-in-the-blank task, but the blanks v=
ary so wildly=E2=80=94dialogue one moment, Python code the next=E2=80=94tha=
t solving them endows the network with general linguistic and problem-solvi=
ng skills. By the end, the weights encode statistical regularities of langu=
age, facts about the world, and patterns of reasoning.

Inference=E2=80=94how a response gets written=20
When you type a prompt, the steps run in reverse, but only a tiny slice of =
compute is needed:
Tokenize the prompt into embeddings.
Run through the transformer to get new contextual vectors.
Read the output logits=E2=80=94raw scores for every token in the vocabulary=
=2E
Apply a sampling strategy to pick the next token. Common choices:
Greedy: choose the highest-probability token (great for translation, dull f=
or storytelling).
Temperature / nucleus (top-p) sampling: inject randomness so the model expl=
ores multiple plausible continuations.
Beam search: keep several high-scoring paths in parallel, then pick the bes=
t full sequence.
The new token is appended to the prompt, and the cycle repeats until the mo=
del hits a stop criterion (max length or end-of-text token). Because each n=
ew token is conditioned on everything before it, coherence emerges naturall=
y=E2=80=94like building a sentence one carefully considered word at a time.
Alignment=E2=80=94making the raw model helpful and safe=20
A raw language model will mimic everything it has seen=E2=80=94including to=
xic, biased, or dangerous text=E2=80=94and has no reason to answer politely=
 or truthfully. So labs add alignment layers:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT): Curated question-answer pairs teach the model=
 desired formats.
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Humans rank multiple mod=
el answers; a reward model learns these rankings, and the base model gets f=
ine-tuned to maximize the reward.
Rule-based =E2=80=9Csystem prompts=E2=80=9D and policy filters: At inferenc=
e time, an invisible instruction like =E2=80=9CYou are ChatGPT, a helpful a=
ssistant=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D sets the behavior frame, while a separate classi=
fier blocks disallowed content.
Together, these steps nudge the model toward answering ways that are honest=
, harmless, and helpful, but they do not take away the harmful training dat=
a the model may have consumed off the internet along the way (ok, we know t=
he internet, it definitely did). Research in 2025 also explores constitutio=
nal AI (giving the model its own set of principles) and toolformer training=
 (teaching it when to call external tools instead of hallucinating). Alignm=
ent is still an active science, because it=E2=80=99s easier to train compet=
ence than perfect judgment. As the WSJ noted this week, alignment is not ea=
sy [ https://substack.com/redirect/43959dfc-9b82-4e8e-bd95-884f14af5e19?j=

Modern upgrades=E2=80=94retrieval, tools, and mixture-of-experts
Looking ahead, I=E2=80=99d simplify a bit and call out three engineering ad=
vances now shape frontier models:
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): Instead of relying solely on what was=
 memorized at train-time, the model can call a search index or vector datab=
ase. The retrieved snippets join the prompt, letting the model quote fresh =
facts and reducing hallucinations. Think of it as giving the LLM an open-bo=
ok exam.
Tool use and function calling: A structured API schema lets the model outpu=
t JSON that triggers external functions=E2=80=94calculators, databases, aut=
onomous agents. The user sees a natural language chat, but behind the scene=
s the model decides, =E2=80=9CI need real-time weather data,=E2=80=9D calls=
 a weather API, then integrates the result into its answer. This extends th=
e model=E2=80=99s capabilities beyond static text.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Instead of one monolithic network, MoE divides pa=
rameters into specialist =E2=80=9Cexperts.=E2=80=9D A lightweight router ch=
ooses which experts to activate per token, so computation scales with activ=
e, not total, parameters. This yields =E2=80=9Cbillion-expert=E2=80=9D mode=
ls that run at practical speeds and store more knowledge.
These upgrades push LLMs from passive text predictors toward dynamic reason=
ing engines embedded in larger software stacks.
Limits and open challenges=20
LLMs are impressive, but as anyone who reads this blog knows, they are very=
 imperfect. They hallucinate when the statistical signal suggests an answer=
 even if no ground truth exists. They can soak up biases present in the dat=
a. Long context windows (hundreds of thousands of tokens) are possible in 2=
025, but attention cost still rises quadratically with length, so truly rec=
alling a whole novel is expensive. Reasoning with many steps stresses the m=
odel=E2=80=99s working memory, which is why chain-of-thought prompting or e=
xternal scratchpads help.
Energy usage is trivial for individuals and non-trivial in aggregate, promp=
ting a revival in nuclear power in the US. Great power competition is pushi=
ng LLMs and AI news into the political arena. Meanwhile outside the US sove=
reign data centers [ https://substack.com/redirect/0a206815-e2ac-49cb-b90f-=

Saudi Arabia to Australia.
So is it parrots or polymaths, or neither?
At heart, an LLM is a disciplined exercise in probability: given what I=E2=
=80=99ve seen, what=E2=80=99s the most likely next token? Yet because langu=
age encodes our collective experience, modeling those probabilities reconst=
ructs large swaths of human knowledge and reasoning.=20
Embeddings give words numeric meaning; transformers weave context; massive =
training distills patterns; alignment guides behavior; and modern add-ons c=
onnect the model to live data and tools.=20
The result feels far more like an intelligent collaborator than a random au=
tocomplete. Understanding this pipeline demystifies the magic: an LLM is ne=
ither conscious nor mystical=E2=80=94it is an extraordinarily sophisticated=
 pattern-recognizer that turns statistics into fluent thought.

These 11 voices form the core signal in AI's noisy landscape, but the field=
's depth extends beyond this list. Honorable mentions include Yann LeCun ch=
allenging AI orthodoxy from Meta, Geoffrey Hinton warning about existential=
 risks, Fei-Fei Li advancing computer vision and AI ethics, Andrew Ng democ=
ratizing AI education, Fran=C3=A7ois Chollet measuring progress toward AGI,=
 and Gary Marcus providing essential skepticism. Each adds valuable perspec=
tive to the conversation. By following this curated network of practitioner=
s, researchers, and analysts, you'll stay grounded in AI's real progress wh=
ile avoiding the endless cycle of hype and speculation.
The Clock Is Ticking (But You've Got This)
So there you have it=E2=80=94your complete guide to understanding AI before=
 GPT-5 drops and changes the game again. We started with those anxious DMs =
about "getting" AI before it's too late, and now you have everything you ne=
ed.
Let's be real: You just consumed what amounts to a small book on AI. From t=
he tactical (GPT-5's summer timeline and unified model approach) to the fou=
ndational (how transformers turn prediction into intelligence) to the pract=
ical (7 resources that actually teach you AI) to the human (11 voices worth=
 following in the noise).
Here's what you now know that 99% of people don't:
Why GPT-5 isn't just "GPT-4 but bigger"=E2=80=94it's a platform reset
How we went from spam filters to ChatGPT (and why that journey matters)
That LLMs aren't magic=E2=80=94they're extraordinarily sophisticated patter=
n recognizers
Where to actually learn AI (spoiler: it's mostly Karpathy being brilliant)
Who to follow for signal over noise when everyone has an AI opinion
The meta-lesson? Understanding AI isn't about keeping up with every Twitter=
 thread or press release. It's about building a solid foundation and knowin=
g where to look for what matters. You don't need to read every paper or try=
 every model. You need the right mental models and the right guides.
Your next move is simple: Pick ONE thing from this guide and start today. W=
atch Karpathy's intro video over lunch. Follow three people from the list. =
Start the neural networks course this weekend. Whatever you choose, just st=
art. Because while we're all waiting for GPT-5 to arrive this summer, the r=
eal opportunity is in what you build with that understanding.
The summer of 2025 isn't just about what OpenAI ships=E2=80=94it's about wh=
o's ready to use it. And now? That's you.
Welcome to the other side of the AI literacy divide. The water's fine, and =
the future is wild.
Now stop reading and start building. The models are waiting.
