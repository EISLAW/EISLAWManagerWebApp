THE ISRAELI-DRUZE ALLIANCE OF NECESSITY [3]
THE GROUP IS PART OF ISRAEL’S BROADER VISION FOR THE MIDDLE EAST.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Last month, clashes erupted between Druze militia groups and Sunni tribes in Syria’s southern province of Sweida. The enmity between the Druze and tribes in the area dates back centuries, but the
absence of state control following the collapse of the Assad regime last year has reignited their rivalry. And this time, Israel has stepped in to defend the Druze. The Israeli air force destroyed an
armored column dispatched by the Syrian government to end the fighting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the attack by saying it was necessary to protect the Druze, with whom Israel
shares a “deep brotherly alliance.”
Immediately after the collapse of the Assad regime, Israeli forces began operating inside Syrian territory under the pretext of safeguarding Israeli security. Israel now controls 625 square kilometers
of territory – in addition to the 1,800 square kilometers of the Golan Heights it has held since 1967. It also built 13 military bases on the recently captured land and has demanded the
demilitarization of southern Syria, an area that equals 8 percent of the country’s total territory.
However, in recent years, the Druze have rediscovered their Arab identity, and some are now skeptical of Israel’s intentions. Many see Israel’s recent actions in Syria as part of Netanyahu’s
broader plan to transform the Middle East. They don’t buy Israel’s attempt to present itself as their protector; they believe its real goal is to establish an alliance of regional minorities
dominated by Israel.
FOUNDATIONS
The Druze community emerged in the early 11th century during the rule of the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt. Their faith is an esoteric and syncretic doctrine rooted in various religious and philosophical
sources, including Ismailism, Platonic teachings and Gnosticism. The Druze also believe in the transmigration of souls. The secretive nature of the faith has contributed to the community’s isolation
and entrenchment in the mountains of southern Syria, Mount Lebanon and the Upper Galilee.
The Druze grew to believe that the conflict in Palestine was a religious dispute between Muslims and Jews, and preferred to stay out of it. However, they played a modest role in the latter part of the
conflict that led to Israel’s rise as a nation-state. Syrian officer Fawzi al-Qawuqji recruited 500 Druze soldiers into a movement meant to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.
However, the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary organization, defeated the group at the Battle of Ramat Yohanan during the Palestinian Civil War in 1947-48. Having suffered heavy losses, the Druze
decided to ally with the Haganah.
In the early years after Israel’s founding, Israeli official Yaakov Shimoni convinced Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to promote the idea of a “blood covenant” between Israel and the Druze. When
the Israeli military started recruiting Druze soldiers, Shimoni said the decision was like a “spear” with which Israel could stab Arab nationalism and exert influence over the Druze in Syria and
Lebanon.
DISENCHANTMENT WITH ISRAEL
The Druze are not a persecuted minority, even if they are portrayed as such. They have been traditionally loyal to the state in which they live. In Israel, they have served in the armed forces and
participated in all of its wars – despite the government’s confiscation of Druze agricultural lands, especially along the Lebanese border, and the imposition of military rule on Arabs living in
Israel, including the Druze, until 1966.
The Druze in Lebanon have largely adopted an Arab nationalist stance hostile toward Israel. In 1979, Lebanese Druze militant Samir Kuntar led a terrorist attack claimed by the Palestine Liberation
Front on Nahariya beach in northern Israel. He spent 29 years in prison and returned to Lebanon in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah in 2008. In Syria, the Druze were actively involved in all aspects of
public life. They also had a significant presence in the Syrian army, with two Druze commanders being appointed chief of the General Staff and two others defense minister, even though the Druze
constitute no more than 3 percent of the total population.
Many Druze in Syria and Lebanon are involved in the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which advocates the unity of Greater Syria (present-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine). Syrian Druze leader
Sultan Pasha al-Atrash led a rebellion against France in 1925 and promoted the unity of the Fertile Crescent countries, which included Iraq and Greater Syria. Shakib Arslan, the maternal grandfather
of Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, was one of the most prominent advocates of Arab nationalism in the 20th century.
After Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, most of its Druze residents remained loyal to Syria and rejected Israeli citizenship, prompting Israel to grant them permanent residency instead. Many
Druze were surprised by the 2018 Jewish nation-state law, which dropped Arabic as an official language. Rabbi Meir Kahane, a far-right politician and the founder of the outlawed Kach party, even
called for the expulsion of the Druze from Israel.
In recent years, the Druze community has grown divided over serving in the Israeli army. Since the early 1970s, the Arab Druze Initiative Committee has campaigned to abolish conscription for Druze and
has organized hundreds of events against military service. Today, the rate of conscientious objectors among Druze men exceeds 60 percent. They have been emboldened by movements such as “Refuse, Your
People Protect You” and “We Are Guardians of the Land, Not Border Guards.”
BROADER VISION
Israel sees the Druze as a small minority group, insignificant compared to the region’s other ethnic minorities like the Kurds, Turkey’s Alevis or Syria’s Alawites. But Israel’s strategy is to
use these groups to undermine the authority of other official or unofficial actors in the region and dominate the Middle East during a moment of unwavering support from the United States.
It is thus cultivating relationships with several groups with which it has long-standing ties. Iraqi Kurds are one example. Relations between the Kurds and the Zionist movement in Palestine began in
1931, when Ben-Gurion commissioned Reuven Shiloah, a Jewish political activist and founder of Mossad, to gather demographic and political data on the Middle East. After completing a three-year mission
in Iraq, Shiloah classified the Kurds as a non-Arab minority living under Arab rule and a suitable ally for the Jewish state. In the second half of the 20th century, Israel provided military and
security assistance to the Kurds in Iraq. The U.S. invasion of Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime further enhanced their partnership. In the early 21st century, Israeli-Kurdish relations
developed in several important and sensitive areas, including intelligence, investment and Israel’s purchase of oil supplies from Kirkuk, where many Iraqi Kurds reside. In northern Syria, the
commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, said last March that he welcomed Israeli support in protecting Kurdish achievements.
As for Syria’s Alawites, several leaders from the community sent a letter to Netanyahu pleading for protection following massacres of their people in the coastal region in March. The request came
after Israel announced that it would not allow the new Syrian regime to harm the country’s Druze population.
Meanwhile, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has been working to build a new Syria. He is not a global jihadist, despite claims to the contrary from Israel, the Pentagon and the CIA. Though he
previously led the jihadist al-Nusra Front, the group’s focus was on the fight against the Islamic State, the Assad regime and Iran’s domination of Syria. Al-Sharaa has repeatedly said his country
has no desire for a military confrontation with Israel and has indicated his desire for peace with the Jewish state. Moreover, even before Israeli airstrikes last December that decimated Syria’s
military assets, Syria did not have the capability to initiate an attack on Israel. Its army is a ragtag collection of militias with diverse identities and ideological affiliations.
Still, Israeli officials have repeatedly insisted that Israel’s military interventions in Syria were necessary. Despite holding direct talks with Syrian diplomats in Baku in July, Israel launched
airstrikes on Syrian government forces in an attempt to break up the clashes in Sweida last month. It justified the attacks under the pretext of defending the Druze from tribal assaults. Israel struck
not only government forces heading south but also the Ministry of Defense headquarters and the presidential palace in the heart of Damascus. The meetings held in recent days between the Syrian foreign
minister and the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, under U.S. and French mediation, were ostensibly focused on solidifying the fragile truce but really aimed at disarming the south of the
country, except for the Druze militias.
The new administration in Damascus has adopted a realist and flexible foreign policy, aiming to reintegrate Syria into the region, cultivate strategic relations with Turkey and forge ties with the
Gulf states, which provide strategic depth that can support Syria economically and politically. Al-Sharaa has extended an olive branch to Israel, but Netanyahu appears uninterested; peace would
jeopardize his ambitions for power projection. Netanyahu’s regional policy, including his overtures to ethnic and religious minorities, requires the fragmentation of Syria, which would serve as a
launchpad to penetrate other countries, such as Lebanon and Iraq.
Israel knows that the Syrian regime has so far failed to impose its authority over the militias in the country. Instead of giving it time to assert itself following Assad’s ouster, Netanyahu ordered
the Israeli air force to immediately attack Syrian air bases, knowing that Syria’s obsolete fighter jets presented no threat to Israel. Israeli actions made the new administration in Damascus appear
weak, thus encouraging separatist movements among Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities to rebel against the nascent state. Netanyahu also knows that al-Sharaa did not order his security forces to
attack Sweida. Netanyahu’s goal is to thwart Syria’s national project as part of his vision, outlined in a speech delivered in October 2023, for a new Middle East. Israel’s dominance over the
Syrian military, left decimated by 14 years of a bloody civil war, has led the Netanyahu government to lose sight of the pitfalls of exercising wanton power. Especially given the international
complicity and indifference, Israel can act without restraint, and Netanyahu knows it.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last month, clashe=
s erupted between Druze militia groups and Sunni tribes in Syria=E2=80=99s =
southern province of Sweida. The enmity between the Druze and tribes in the=
 area dates back centuries, but the absence of state control following the =
collapse of the Assad regime last year has reignited their rivalry. And thi=
s time, Israel has stepped in to defend the Druze. The Israeli air force de=
stroyed an armored column dispatched by the Syrian government to end the fi=
ghting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the attack by s=
aying it was necessary to protect the Druze, with whom Israel shares a =E2=
=80=9Cdeep brotherly alliance.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Immediately after =
the collapse of the Assad regime, Israeli forces began operating inside Syr=
ian territory under the pretext of safeguarding Israeli security. Israel no=
w controls 625 square kilometers of territory =E2=80=93 in addition to the =
1,800 square kilometers of the Golan Heights it has held since 1967. It als=
o built 13 military bases on the recently captured land and has demanded th=
e demilitarization of southern Syria, an area that equals 8 percent of the =
country=E2=80=99s total territory.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, in recent=
 years, the Druze have rediscovered their Arab identity, and some are now s=
keptical of Israel=E2=80=99s intentions. Many see Israel=E2=80=99s recent a=
ctions in Syria as part of Netanyahu=E2=80=99s broader plan to transform th=
e Middle East. They don=E2=80=99t buy Israel=E2=80=99s attempt to present i=
tself as their protector; they believe its real goal is to establish an all=
iance of regional minorities dominated by Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Foundation=
s</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Druze communit=
y emerged in the early 11th century during the rule of the Fatimid dynasty =
in Egypt. Their faith is an esoteric and syncretic doctrine rooted in vario=
us religious and philosophical sources, including Ismailism, Platonic teach=
ings and Gnosticism. The Druze also believe in the transmigration of souls.=
 The secretive nature of the faith has contributed to the community=E2=80=
=99s isolation and entrenchment in the mountains of southern Syria, Mount L=
ebanon and the Upper Galilee.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Druze grew to =
believe that the conflict in Palestine was a religious dispute between Musl=
ims and Jews, and preferred to stay out of it. However, they played a modes=
t role in the latter part of the conflict that led to Israel=E2=80=99s rise=
 as a nation-state. Syrian officer Fawzi al-Qawuqji recruited 500 Druze sol=
diers into a movement meant to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state =
in Palestine. However, the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary organization, de=
feated the group at the Battle of Ramat Yohanan during the Palestinian Civi=
l War in 1947-48. Having suffered heavy losses, the Druze decided to ally w=
ith the Haganah.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the early years=
 after Israel=E2=80=99s founding, Israeli official Yaakov Shimoni convinced=
 Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to promote the idea of a =E2=80=9Cblood co=
venant=E2=80=9D between Israel and the Druze. When the Israeli military sta=
rted recruiting Druze soldiers, Shimoni said the decision was like a =E2=80=
=9Cspear=E2=80=9D with which Israel could stab Arab nationalism and exert i=
nfluence over the Druze in Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Disenchant=
ment With Israel</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Druze are not =
a persecuted minority, even if they are portrayed as such. They have been t=
raditionally loyal to the state in which they live. In Israel, they have se=
rved in the armed forces and participated in all of its wars =E2=80=93 desp=
ite the government=E2=80=99s confiscation of Druze agricultural lands, espe=
cially along the Lebanese border, and the imposition of military rule on Ar=
abs living in Israel, including the Druze, until 1966.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Druze in Leban=
on have largely adopted an Arab nationalist stance hostile toward Israel. I=
n 1979, Lebanese Druze militant Samir Kuntar led a terrorist attack claimed=
 by the Palestine Liberation Front on Nahariya beach in northern Israel. He=
 spent 29 years in prison and returned to Lebanon in a prisoner swap with H=
ezbollah in 2008. In Syria, the Druze were actively involved in all aspects=
 of public life. They also had a significant presence in the Syrian army, w=
ith two Druze commanders being appointed chief of the General Staff and two=
 others defense minister, even though the Druze constitute no more than 3 p=
ercent of the total population.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Many Druze in Syri=
a and Lebanon are involved in the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which ad=
vocates the unity of Greater Syria (present-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and =
Palestine). Syrian Druze leader Sultan Pasha al-Atrash led a rebellion agai=
nst France in 1925 and promoted the unity of the Fertile Crescent countries=
, which included Iraq and Greater Syria. Shakib Arslan, the maternal grandf=
ather of Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, was one of the most prominen=
t advocates of Arab nationalism in the 20th century.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">After Israel annex=
ed the Golan Heights in 1981, most of its Druze residents remained loyal to=
 Syria and rejected Israeli citizenship, prompting Israel to grant them per=
manent residency instead. Many Druze were surprised by the 2018 Jewish nati=
on-state law, which dropped Arabic as an official language. Rabbi Meir Kaha=
ne, a far-right politician and the founder of the outlawed Kach party, even=
 called for the expulsion of the Druze from Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In recent years, t=
he Druze community has grown divided over serving in the Israeli army. Sinc=
e the early 1970s, the Arab Druze Initiative Committee has campaigned to ab=
olish conscription for Druze and has organized hundreds of events against m=
ilitary service. Today, the rate of conscientious objectors among Druze men=
 exceeds 60 percent. They have been emboldened by movements such as =E2=80=
=9CRefuse, Your People Protect You=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CWe Are Guardians o=
f the Land, Not Border Guards.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Broader Vi=
sion</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel sees the Dr=
uze as a small minority group, insignificant compared to the region=E2=80=
=99s other ethnic minorities like the Kurds, Turkey=E2=80=99s Alevis or Syr=
ia=E2=80=99s Alawites. But Israel=E2=80=99s strategy is to use these groups=
 to undermine the authority of other official or unofficial actors in the r=
egion and dominate the Middle East during a moment of unwavering support fr=
om the United States.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It is thus cultiva=
ting relationships with several groups with which it has long-standing ties=
. Iraqi Kurds are one example. Relations between the Kurds and the Zionist =
movement in Palestine began in 1931, when Ben-Gurion commissioned Reuven Sh=
iloah, a Jewish political activist and founder of Mossad, to gather demogra=
phic and political data on the Middle East. After completing a three-year m=
ission in Iraq, Shiloah classified the Kurds as a non-Arab minority living =
under Arab rule and a suitable ally for the Jewish state. In the second hal=
f of the 20th century, Israel provided military and security assistance to =
the Kurds in Iraq. The U.S. invasion of Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein=
=E2=80=99s regime further enhanced their partnership. In the early 21st cen=
tury, Israeli-Kurdish relations developed in several important and sensitiv=
e areas, including intelligence, investment and Israel=E2=80=99s purchase o=
f oil supplies from Kirkuk, where many Iraqi Kurds reside. In northern Syri=
a, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi,=
 said last March that he welcomed Israeli support in protecting Kurdish ach=
ievements.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As for Syria=E2=80=
=99s Alawites, several leaders from the community sent a letter to Netanyah=
u pleading for protection following massacres of their people in the coasta=
l region in March. The request came after Israel announced that it would no=
t allow the new Syrian regime to harm the country=E2=80=99s Druze populatio=
n.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, Syrian =
President Ahmad al-Sharaa has been working to build a new Syria. He is not =
a global jihadist, despite claims to the contrary from Israel, the Pentagon=
 and the CIA. Though he previously led the jihadist al-Nusra Front, the gro=
up=E2=80=99s focus was on the fight against the Islamic State, the Assad re=
gime and Iran=E2=80=99s domination of Syria. Al-Sharaa has repeatedly said =
his country has no desire for a military confrontation with Israel and has =
indicated his desire for peace with the Jewish state. Moreover, even before=
 Israeli airstrikes last December that decimated Syria=E2=80=99s military a=
ssets, Syria did not have the capability to initiate an attack on Israel. I=
ts army is a ragtag collection of militias with diverse identities and ideo=
logical affiliations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Still, Israeli off=
icials have repeatedly insisted that Israel=E2=80=99s military intervention=
s in Syria were necessary. Despite holding direct talks with Syrian diploma=
ts in Baku in July, Israel launched airstrikes on Syrian government forces =
in an attempt to break up the clashes in Sweida last month. It justified th=
e attacks under the pretext of defending the Druze from tribal assaults. Is=
rael struck not only government forces heading south but also the Ministry =
of Defense headquarters and the presidential palace in the heart of Damascu=
s. The meetings held in recent days between the Syrian foreign minister and=
 the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, under U.S. and French mediation=
, were ostensibly focused on solidifying the fragile truce but really aimed=
 at disarming the south of the country, except for the Druze militias.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The new administra=
tion in Damascus has adopted a realist and flexible foreign policy, aiming =
to reintegrate Syria into the region, cultivate strategic relations with Tu=
rkey and forge ties with the Gulf states, which provide strategic depth tha=
t can support Syria economically and politically. Al-Sharaa has extended an=
 olive branch to Israel, but Netanyahu appears uninterested; peace would je=
opardize his ambitions for power projection. Netanyahu=E2=80=99s regional p=
olicy, including his overtures to ethnic and religious minorities, requires=
 the fragmentation of Syria, which would serve as a launchpad to penetrate =
other countries, such as Lebanon and Iraq.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel knows that =
the Syrian regime has so far failed to impose its authority over the militi=
as in the country. Instead of giving it time to assert itself following Ass=
ad=E2=80=99s ouster, Netanyahu ordered the Israeli air force to immediately=
 attack Syrian air bases, knowing that Syria=E2=80=99s obsolete fighter jet=
s presented no threat to Israel. Israeli actions made the new administratio=
n in Damascus appear weak, thus encouraging separatist movements among Syri=
a=E2=80=99s ethnic and religious minorities to rebel against the nascent st=
ate. Netanyahu also knows that al-Sharaa did not order his security forces =
to attack Sweida. Netanyahu=E2=80=99s goal is to thwart Syria=E2=80=99s nat=
ional project as part of his vision, outlined in a speech delivered in Octo=
ber 2023, for a new Middle East. Israel=E2=80=99s dominance over the Syrian=
 military, left decimated by 14 years of a bloody civil war, has led the Ne=
tanyahu government to lose sight of the pitfalls of exercising wanton power=
. Especially given the international complicity and indifference, Israel ca=
n act without restraint, and Netanyahu knows it.</p>
