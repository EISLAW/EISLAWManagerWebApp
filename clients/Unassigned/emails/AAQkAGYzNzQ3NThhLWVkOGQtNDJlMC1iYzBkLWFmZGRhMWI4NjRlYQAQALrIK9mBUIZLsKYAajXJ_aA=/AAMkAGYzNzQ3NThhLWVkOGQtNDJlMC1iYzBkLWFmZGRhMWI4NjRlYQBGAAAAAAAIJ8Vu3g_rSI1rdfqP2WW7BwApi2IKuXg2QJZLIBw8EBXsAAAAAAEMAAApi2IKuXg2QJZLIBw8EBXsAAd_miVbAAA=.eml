I'm the guy with books in every single video.=20
Look behind me in any frame=E2=80=94there they are, spine after spine, beca=
use reading is how I metabolize the world. So when people started flooding =
my inbox asking "What should I read about AI?" and "Is reading even worth i=
t when ChatGPT can summarize everything?"=E2=80=94I couldn't just send them=
 a list.=20
The more I listened, the more I realized I was hearing from completely diff=
erent audiences. The C-suite executive trying to make AI strategy decisions=
 doesn't need the same books as the engineer building models. The product m=
anager working with AI teams needs different foundations than the policy ma=
ker writing regulations. Everyone was drowning in the same overwhelming flo=
od of AI content, but they needed different lifelines.
There=E2=80=99s been a pandemic of various sources claiming we=E2=80=99re e=
xperiencing "knowledge rot"=E2=80=94that AI is destroying human knowledge b=
y endlessly recycling and regurgitating information. The panic is palpable.=
 People are either abandoning books entirely ("why read when AI can summari=
ze?") or mindlessly parroting claims that you can read War and Peace in 10 =
minutes with AI (yes I saw someone claiming that on TikTok, she said she re=
ad 40 books a day and I wanted to scream.)
I think we=E2=80=99re approaching this completely wrong.=20
The problem isn't that AI is rotting knowledge. Making knowledge rot the ob=
ject paralyzes us. It=E2=80=99s an incorrect frame.
The problem is we're using old mental models for a new information landscap=
e. This is a skill issue, and it=E2=80=99s absolutely solvable. We don't ha=
ve a knowledge crisis=E2=80=94we have a filtering crisis. And nobody's teac=
hing us how to read strategically when we have an AI companion literally in=
 our pocket.
What's in this guide:
=E2=80=A2 34 carefully curated AI books organized into five distinct learni=
ng pathways (Executive Strategist, Technical Practitioner, Informed Profess=
ional, Policy Maker, Startup Founder)
=E2=80=A2 Three types of reading decoded: Awareness reading (scanning), ret=
rieval reading (hunting facts), and connectome reading (deep rewiring)=E2=
=80=94plus exactly when to use each
=E2=80=A2 The Quick Guide: Strategic shortcuts for identifying which 20% of=
 any book deserves deep attention
=E2=80=A2 The Complete Guide: Comprehensive prompt library, workflows for d=
ifferent content types, and a 90-day implementation plan
=E2=80=A2 Interactive Claude artifact: Personalized pathway matcher that sh=
ows how to use AI to save 40-60% reading time while improving comprehension
=E2=80=A2 My actual reading methods: How I read "hungrily" between writing =
and videos, using AI as reconnaissance before diving deep
=E2=80=A2 Time estimates and prerequisites for every book, so you know exac=
tly what you're committing to
=E2=80=A2 The anti-knowledge-rot thesis: Why we need better filters, not le=
ss AI
I've spent months building this because I believe we can read more effectiv=
ely with AI, not despite it. Once you understand which type of reading you =
need for which book, and how to use AI as a reading companion rather than a=
 replacement, everything changes. You read more, not less. You comprehend b=
etter, not worse. You save your deep reading energy for what actually matte=
rs.
This isn't about reading less, or reading less carefully. It's about matchi=
ng your reading approach to what you're actually trying to achieve.

This guide is about being strategic with your brain. It shows you how to us=
e AI to quickly identify which 20% of any book actually deserves your deep =
attention, how to extract what you need from the other 80% without pretendi=
ng you read it all, and how to synthesize insights across books without bur=
ning out.=20
I'm not telling you to read less=E2=80=94I'm showing you how to match your =
reading approach to what you're trying to achieve. Sometimes you need every=
 word. Sometimes you need the frameworks. Sometimes you just need to know a=
n argument exists. The trick is knowing which is which, and using AI to han=
dle the information processing so you can save your deep reading capacity f=
or what actually matters.

This guide teaches you how to read strategically in the age of AI. It's bui=
lt around a systematic approach where you allocate your attention based on =
what actually matters=E2=80=94deep focus for the 20% that's crucial, strate=
gic skimming for the rest.=20
The guide includes a curated library of AI books (also listed below), organ=
ized by learning progression, with realistic time estimates and prerequisit=
es for each. There's a comprehensive prompt library that helps you use AI t=
ools to enhance comprehension rather than replace thinking=E2=80=94prompts =
for confusion resolution, argument analysis, and synthesizing across multip=
le books.=20
It also provides specific workflows for different types of content (technic=
al books, business strategy, research papers) and a 90-day implementation p=
lan to build these practices into your routine. The core insight is that yo=
u have finite cognitive resources and need to be strategic about where you =
invest them, especially given the overwhelming amount of AI content availab=
le.
Reading in the Age of AI
I've been getting asked constantly about reading. People look at my (extrem=
ely internet visible) bookshelf and ask what I read, how I know I'm reading=
 the right things, whether reading even matters anymore when AI can summari=
ze everything. The Wall Street Journal came out this week with an assessmen=
t suggesting we're experiencing "knowledge rot" because AI is just recyclin=
g and regurgitating information. No new knowledge being produced, just summ=
aries of summaries.
I don't think that's quite right. But I've been struggling to articulate wh=
y, and I think I finally understand what's happening.
The way we learned to read was shaped by scarcity. You wrote things down to=
 remember them. Reading was retrieval. That was the fundamental technology=
=E2=80=94commerce records, court documents, sacred texts. The act of readin=
g was inseparable from the act of remembering.
But I've been noticing something in my own reading habits. I read different=
ly depending on what I'm trying to accomplish, and I don't think we have go=
od language for these differences. Sometimes I'm scrolling through articles=
 just to know what's out there. Sometimes I'm hunting for a specific fact o=
r technique. And sometimes=E2=80=94rarely, but importantly=E2=80=94I'm read=
ing in a way that restructures how I think.
Three Kinds of Reading
Let me try to name what I've been observing. I think there are three fundam=
entally different activities we call "reading," and conflating them is part=
 of why we're so confused about AI's impact on knowledge.
The first is what I think of as awareness reading. You're scrolling X, skim=
ming headlines, flipping through books at the bookstore. You're not trying =
to remember everything=E2=80=94you're trying to maintain a sense of what's =
happening in your field. It's like monitoring radar. You need to know what'=
s on the horizon without studying every blip in detail.
I used to feel guilty about this kind of reading, as if I was cheating by n=
ot going deeper. But I've come to think awareness reading serves a critical=
 function. The problem is we don't have good filters for determining what d=
eserves more attention.
The second type is information retrieval. This is what we do with Google, t=
hough we don't usually call it reading. You need a specific fact, a particu=
lar technique, an answer to a concrete question. When I look up how token a=
rchitecture works or search for a Python library, I'm doing retrieval readi=
ng.
I think LLMs are essentially retrieval reading machines. What people are ca=
lling "Answer Engine Optimization" is just SEO for this kind of reading. An=
d that's fine=E2=80=94retrieval reading has always been instrumental rather=
 than transformative.
The third type is what I'm calling connectome reading, though I'm not entir=
ely satisfied with the term. This is reading that literally rewires your br=
ain=E2=80=94forming new neural pathways, pruning old ones, building new pat=
terns of thought. It's metabolically expensive. Research suggests deep read=
ing burns significant glucose because your brain is working so hard to inte=
grate new structures.
Teachers worry this kind of reading is disappearing, and they might be righ=
t. But I wonder if part of the problem is that we expect people to do too m=
uch of it. You can't connectome-read everything. Your brain doesn't have th=
e energy.
Using AI as a Reading Tool
Once I started thinking about reading this way, my whole approach to using =
AI changed. Instead of feeling like AI was replacing reading, I began using=
 it to be more intentional about which kind of reading I was doing.
Take a book like AI Literacy Fundamentals by Ben Jones. It's clearly design=
ed for beginners, packed with facts about how AI systems work. This is perf=
ect for retrieval reading with AI assistance. I get the physical book=E2=80=
=94I think having the actual text matters=E2=80=94but then I work with Clau=
de or GPT-5 Pro as a reading guide. I describe what I already know and what=
 I'm trying to learn, and the AI helps me navigate to exactly the sections =
I need. What would be a 10-hour cover-to-cover read becomes 2 hours of targ=
eted learning.
But then there's something like Ethan Mollick's Co-Intelligence. That book =
builds an argument cumulatively. Each chapter assumes you've internalized t=
he previous one. The value isn't in isolated facts but in how the ideas int=
erconnect and build on each other. You need to read it end to end, let it s=
ink in. No shortcuts.
The WSJ article about knowledge rot? Pure awareness reading. I need to know=
 the argument exists, understand the thesis. Perplexity can extract that in=
 thirty seconds. Spending twenty minutes reading the full article wouldn't =
add much value.
How I Actually Read
I read hungrily, in whatever scraps of time I can steal between writing, ma=
king videos, and taking care of the kids. I'm like Danny Ocean in Ocean's 1=
1=E2=80=94I'm looking to raid and read with stealth and style.
I don't mind summaries. I'll ask Perplexity to dive into a book or topic, b=
ut I use it as reconnaissance. Is there something here worth retrieving, or=
 do I need to order this and actually dive deep? Since I've probably read m=
ore about AI than 99% of people at this point, it's less about filling gaps=
 and more about tracking where the entire field is moving.
I use Notebook LM to help me process arXiv papers. I use GPT-5 Pro for othe=
rs. I'm AI-omnivorous just like I'm reading-omnivorous. AI is my chisel to =
break into the reading, and then I grab and devour whatever I can, always l=
ooking to maximize those moments where I can spark connections between what=
 I'm reading.
The thing is, I still do connectome reading on some AI texts when they prom=
ise to restructure how I think about the field. But I also love fiction for=
 connectome reading=E2=80=94it stretches my brain in completely different w=
ays. When you're swimming in technical content all day, a great novel rewir=
es you in ways that no technical book can.
Finding the Cracks Between Domains
Here's where things get interesting. I've been learning Swedish=E2=80=94not=
 well, but learning. I have this unusual background: I speak English and In=
donesian. There's literally nothing written about learning Swedish from an =
Indonesian baseline. No textbook addresses this specific combination.
So I worked with GPT-5 Pro to create something new: a framework for underst=
anding Swedish grammar through Indonesian patterns. It's not revolutionary=
=E2=80=94any linguist who knows both languages could create it. But nobody =
has, because the market is too small to justify the effort.
This is what excites me about AI-assisted reading and learning. The advance=
d reasoning models are remarkably good at stitching between domains. If you=
 have knowledge in multiple areas, AI can help you find the cracks between =
them, the unexpected connections that your particular background makes visi=
ble.
I don't know what your version of Swedish-Indonesian might be. Maybe you kn=
ow both finance and ecology, or cooking and chemistry, or project managemen=
t and theater. Whatever domains you've inhabited, there are probably bridge=
s between them that nobody's built because the audience would be too small.=
 But AI doesn't care about market size.
The Real Problem Isn't Knowledge Rot
I think the knowledge rot thesis misunderstands what's happening. We're not=
 producing less knowledge. If anything, we're drowning in information=E2=80=
=94good information, valuable expertise, important insights. The problem is=
 our filters have collapsed.
It reminds me of what's happened in hiring. Recruiters aren't getting fewer=
 resumes; they're getting thousands of AI-polished applications that all lo=
ok perfect. The system didn't break from scarcity. It broke from abundance =
without adequate filtering mechanisms.
The same thing is happening with reading and knowledge. We need better ways=
 to sort through the avalanche, to identify what deserves awareness reading=
 versus retrieval reading versus deep engagement. And I think AI, properly =
used, can be part of that solution rather than the problem.
What This Means for You
The hardest part isn't reading efficiently=E2=80=94it's choosing what deser=
ves deep reading. We have limited glucose, limited time, limited deep atten=
tion. In a world of infinite content, the core skill becomes curation rathe=
r than consumption.
My heuristic: if a book might change how I think about a domain, it gets co=
nnectome reading. If it's teaching me specific facts or skills, it gets ret=
rieval reading. Everything else gets awareness reading or gets skipped enti=
rely.
This isn't about reading less. I'm reading more than ever=E2=80=94but I'm r=
eading strategically. Awareness reading keeps me current without drowning. =
Retrieval reading gets me specific knowledge efficiently. And I save my dee=
p reading energy for books that might actually change how I think=E2=80=94w=
hether that's Richard Hamming on engineering or a novel that shows me a com=
pletely different way of seeing the world.
The Question of Passion
What worries me isn't knowledge rot but something more fundamental. Your cu=
riosity, your passion for a subject, your desire to understand=E2=80=94AI c=
an't generate these. It can only amplify them.
When students use AI to generate essays without engaging with the material,=
 the problem isn't the technology. It's that we haven't given them reasons =
to care. The educational system that measured understanding through essay p=
roduction was always measuring compliance more than comprehension. AI just =
made the game obvious.
The people who create genuinely new knowledge have always been voracious re=
aders who composted information until something new emerged. They read cust=
omers, markets, technical papers, philosophy=E2=80=94whatever fed their obs=
ession. That magical compost pile where ideas decompose and recombine still=
 requires human passion to generate heat.
I think about Richard Hamming's The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, a=
 book from the Stripe Press collection that isn't directly about AI but exp=
lains how innovation happens in technical spaces. You can't summary-hack yo=
ur way through it. You have to let it change how you think about creative t=
echnical work.
Moving Forward
I don't have all the answers here. I'm still experimenting, still learning =
what works. But I'm convinced the problem isn't that AI is destroying readi=
ng or creating knowledge rot. The problem is we're using old mental models =
for a new information landscape.
Maybe we need to be more honest about the different types of reading and th=
eir different purposes. Maybe we need to recognize that deep reading is a l=
imited resource that should be carefully allocated. Maybe we need to get be=
tter at using AI as a reading assistant rather than a reading replacement.
I keep coming back to passion and curiosity. If you care about something, r=
eally care about it, you'll find yourself naturally doing all three types o=
f reading. You'll awareness-read to understand the landscape, retrieval-rea=
d to fill specific gaps, and connectome-read the works that promise to tran=
sform your understanding.
The tools are just tools. What matters is having something you want to unde=
rstand badly enough to use them well.
Your AI-Accelerated Learning Pathways
I've built an interactive tool that matches you to one of five learning pat=
hways. Let me explain how I think about this, because it's different from j=
ust giving you a reading list.
The Three Ways We Actually Read
I've been thinking about this a lot. We call everything "reading," but I've=
 noticed I do three completely different things with books:
Sometimes I'm reading to fundamentally change how I think=E2=80=94what I ca=
ll connectome reading. I need every word. I need to sit with ideas. AI can =
help clarify confusing parts, but I'm doing the hard work of letting the bo=
ok rewire my brain.
Other times I'm just hunting for specific information=E2=80=94retrieval rea=
ding. I don't need to read all 800 pages of Deep Learning to understand CNN=
s. I need someone to point me to the right chapter and explain the math. Th=
at's where AI shines.
And then there's awareness reading=E2=80=94I just need to know what's out t=
here. What are the main arguments? What frameworks exist? I'm scanning the =
field, not studying it deeply.
Once I started thinking this way, my whole approach to using AI with books =
changed.
The Five Pathways I've Identified
The Executive Strategist
I designed this for leaders who need to make AI decisions but aren't going =
to code. You're dealing with boards asking about AI strategy, vendors pitch=
ing solutions, teams proposing initiatives.
The pathway starts with basic literacy=E2=80=94not to make you technical, b=
ut to decode the vocabulary. Then it moves through strategic frameworks. Wh=
at surprised me is how important the cognitive science books are here. Thin=
king, Fast and Slow isn't an AI book, but understanding cognitive biases is=
 essential for seeing how AI changes organizational decision-making.
You'll read Co-Intelligence deeply because Mollick has actually done this=
=E2=80=94he's deployed AI in organizations. But for something like Competin=
g in the Age of AI, you're extracting frameworks, not reading every case st=
udy. Let AI pull out what applies to your industry.
The Technical Practitioner
This is for engineers who need to build real systems. I've watched too many=
 developers try to read Deep Learning cover to cover and burn out. That's n=
ot how technical learning works.
These books become your reference library. You're building something, you h=
it a problem, you look up the solution. AI becomes your pair programmer=E2=
=80=94translating math to code, explaining error messages, suggesting alter=
natives.
The progression matters though. Start with The Master Algorithm to understa=
nd different ML paradigms=E2=80=94it organizes the chaos. Then Hands-On Mac=
hine Learning for practical foundations. Only then tackle the heavy math bo=
oks, and only the parts you need.
The Informed Professional
This one's close to my heart because it's for people like product managers =
and designers who work with AI but won't write training loops. You need to =
know what's possible, what's dangerous, what's hype.
The balance here is tricky. You need enough technical understanding to push=
 back on engineering ("this seems like it should be simple") but also know =
when to accept constraints. You need to write prompts that actually work. Y=
ou need to spot vendor BS.
Co-Intelligence is helpful for getting a sense of where customers are at, a=
nd you should play close attention to it. Prompt Engineering is pure retrie=
val=E2=80=94find the patterns that work for your role. Hello World is aware=
ness=E2=80=94know where algorithms fail without memorizing every example.
The Policy Maker
I'll be honest=E2=80=94this pathway asks more of you than the others. If yo=
u're writing regulations or studying societal impact, you need deep underst=
anding of both capabilities and limitations.
You'll read books like G=C3=B6del, Escher, Bach that aren't even about AI d=
irectly, because understanding intelligence philosophically matters for gov=
ernance. You need to know not just what AI does, but what we're even talkin=
g about when we say "intelligence."
The technical books here are for literacy, not implementation. You need to =
understand transformers well enough to know if proposed regulations would a=
ctually work, but you're not building them.
The Startup Founder
This is for entrepreneurs who see AI opportunity but need to separate reali=
ty from hype. You need to know enough to hire well, make architecture decis=
ions, and not compete where you can't win.
Start with The Scaling Era=E2=80=94these are the people building the fronti=
er models, talking candidly about what's real. You need to hear this direct=
ly, not filtered through press releases. Then build technical literacy=E2=
=80=94enough to evaluate your engineers' decisions, not enough to make them=
 yourself.
The strategic books matter here too. High Growth Handbook has maybe three c=
hapters directly relevant to AI companies, but those chapters are gold. Let=
 AI extract them.
How I Actually Use AI with Books
Before I start a book, I tell AI what I'm trying to accomplish. Not just "s=
ummarize this book" but "I'm a founder trying to understand if LLMs are rig=
ht for my product. What should I focus on?" (And yes, I do sometimes read w=
ithout AI entirely, and I think that=E2=80=99s a good practice too!)
For deep reading, I use AI like a reading companion. After each chapter: "H=
elp me think about this. What questions should this raise? How does this co=
nnect to what I read last week?" I'm not asking for summaries=E2=80=94I'm a=
sking for thought partnership.
For retrieval reading, I'm shameless about jumping around. "I need to under=
stand RLHF for a board presentation. Where do I look and what's the simples=
t valid explanation?" I'm treating the book like documentation, not literat=
ure.
For awareness reading, I want frameworks and updates. "Extract the strategi=
c frameworks and update the 2019 examples with current ones." I'm not prete=
nding I read the whole thing=E2=80=94I'm getting what I need.
The thing is, this isn't about reading less. I read more than ever. But I r=
ead strategically, matching my approach to what I'm trying to achieve.

I've created an interactive tool that matches you with one of five speciali=
zed AI learning pathways based on your role and goals. Each pathway is care=
fully sequenced, tells you exactly which reading mode to use for each book =
(awareness, retrieval, or connectome), and shows you how AI assistance can =
save 40-60% of your reading time while improving comprehension.
The five pathways are:
The Executive Strategist - For C-suite executives and senior managers who n=
eed to make informed AI decisions without getting lost in technical details=
=2E Focus on strategy, ethics, and organizational transformation.
The Technical Practitioner - For engineers and developers transitioning int=

Technical Implementation
If you're going to build AI systems, these are your reference manuals. I've=
 organized them from accessible to advanced. G=C3=A9ron's Hands-On Machine =
Learning remains the best practical starting point I've found=E2=80=94actua=
l code that works, explained clearly. The deeper books like Goodfellow's De=
ep Learning and Bishop's Pattern Recognition provide the mathematical found=
ations when you need them. A word of warning: don't try to read these cover=
 to cover. Treat them as technical references and dive into specific chapte=
rs as your projects demand.

Large Language Models & Modern AI
The field moved so fast that we needed entirely new books about transformer=
s and LLMs. These authors are practitioners who've built and deployed these=
 systems. What I find valuable here is the emphasis on engineering rather t=
han theory=E2=80=94Raschka shows you how to build an LLM from scratch, whil=
e Huyen explains how to keep it running in production. If you're working wi=
th AI tools professionally, Phoenix and Taylor's prompt engineering guide h=
as become essential. These books acknowledge that most of us will use exist=
ing models rather than train new ones, and they focus on doing that well.

AI Theory & Philosophy
Sometimes you need to step back and think about what we're actually buildin=
g. These books tackle the bigger questions=E2=80=94what is intelligence, ho=
w do we align AI with human values, what are we even trying to achieve? Chr=
istian's The Alignment Problem manages to be both technically informed and =
philosophically rich. Domingos attempts to unify all of machine learning in=
to one framework. Russell and Norvig provide the academic foundations that =
everything else builds on. I turn to these when I need to think deeply abou=
t AI rather than just implement it.

Systems Thinking & Cognitive Science
AI doesn't exist in isolation=E2=80=94it interacts with human cognition, or=
ganizational systems, and social structures. These books help you understan=
d those interactions. Kahneman's work on cognitive biases becomes essential=
 when you realize AI systems can amplify or mitigate those same biases. Mea=
dows teaches you to see feedback loops and emergent behaviors. Hofstadter's=
 GEB remains the deepest meditation on intelligence and consciousness I've =
encountered. These aren't AI books per se, but they're books that help you =
think about AI in context.

b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This guide teaches you how =
to read strategically in the age of AI. It's built around a systematic appr=
oach where you allocate your attention based on what actually matters=E2=80=
=94deep focus for the 20% that's crucial, strategic skimming for the rest. =
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">The guide includes a curated library of AI books (also lis=
ted below), organized by learning progression, with realistic time estimate=
s and prerequisites for each. There's a comprehensive prompt library that h=
elps you use AI tools to enhance comprehension rather than replace thinking=
=E2=80=94prompts for confusion resolution, argument analysis, and synthesiz=
ing across multiple books. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

lows for different types of content (technical books, business strategy, re=
search papers) and a 90-day implementation plan to build these practices in=
to your routine. The core insight is that you have finite cognitive resourc=
es and need to be strategic about where you invest them, especially given t=
he overwhelming amount of AI content available.</p><h1 class=3D"header-anch=

e Age of AI</h1><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I've been getting asked constantly about readi=
ng. People look at my (extremely internet visible) bookshelf and ask what I=
 read, how I know I'm reading the right things, whether reading even matter=
s anymore when AI can summarize everything. The Wall Street Journal came ou=
t this week with an assessment suggesting we're experiencing &quot;knowledg=
e rot&quot; because AI is just recycling and regurgitating information. No =
new knowledge being produced, just summaries of summaries.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
I don't think that's quite right. But I've been struggling to articulate wh=
y, and I think I finally understand what's happening.</p><p style=3D"margin=
: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The w=
ay we learned to read was shaped by scarcity. You wrote things down to reme=
mber them. Reading was retrieval. That was the fundamental technology=E2=80=
=94commerce records, court documents, sacred texts. The act of reading was =
inseparable from the act of remembering.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But I've been noti=
cing something in my own reading habits. I read differently depending on wh=
at I'm trying to accomplish, and I don't think we have good language for th=
ese differences. Sometimes I'm scrolling through articles just to know what=
's out there. Sometimes I'm hunting for a specific fact or technique. And s=
ometimes=E2=80=94rarely, but importantly=E2=80=94I'm reading in a way that =
restructures how I think.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"posi=

tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Let me try to name what I've been observing. I think there are thr=
ee fundamentally different activities we call &quot;reading,&quot; and conf=
lating them is part of why we're so confused about AI's impact on knowledge=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">The first is what I think of as awareness reading. You're=
 scrolling X, skimming headlines, flipping through books at the bookstore. =
You're not trying to remember everything=E2=80=94you're trying to maintain =
a sense of what's happening in your field. It's like monitoring radar. You =
need to know what's on the horizon without studying every blip in detail.</=
p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=
t-size: 16px;">I used to feel guilty about this kind of reading, as if I wa=
s cheating by not going deeper. But I've come to think awareness reading se=
rves a critical function. The problem is we don't have good filters for det=
ermining what deserves more attention.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The second type is i=
nformation retrieval. This is what we do with Google, though we don't usual=
ly call it reading. You need a specific fact, a particular technique, an an=
swer to a concrete question. When I look up how token architecture works or=
 search for a Python library, I'm doing retrieval reading.</p><p style=3D"m=
argin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">=
I think LLMs are essentially retrieval reading machines. What people are ca=
lling &quot;Answer Engine Optimization&quot; is just SEO for this kind of r=
eading. And that's fine=E2=80=94retrieval reading has always been instrumen=
tal rather than transformative.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The third type is what I'm =
calling connectome reading, though I'm not entirely satisfied with the term=
. This is reading that literally rewires your brain=E2=80=94forming new neu=
ral pathways, pruning old ones, building new patterns of thought. It's meta=
bolically expensive. Research suggests deep reading burns significant gluco=
se because your brain is working so hard to integrate new structures.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">Teachers worry this kind of reading is disappearing, and they mi=
ght be right. But I wonder if part of the problem is that we expect people =
to do too much of it. You can't connectome-read everything. Your brain does=
n't have the energy.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position:=

o using AI changed. Instead of feeling like AI was replacing reading, I beg=
an using it to be more intentional about which kind of reading I was doing.=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;"><span>Take a book like </span><em>AI Literacy Fundamentals=
</em><span> by Ben Jones. It's clearly designed for beginners, packed with =
facts about how AI systems work. This is perfect for retrieval reading with=
 AI assistance. I get the physical book=E2=80=94I think having the actual t=
ext matters=E2=80=94but then I work with Claude or GPT-5 Pro as a reading g=
uide. I describe what I already know and what I'm trying to learn, and the =
AI helps me navigate to exactly the sections I need. What would be a 10-hou=

hapter assumes you've internalized the previous one. The value isn't in iso=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">I don't mind summaries. I'll ask Perplexity to dive into a book or to=
pic, but I use it as reconnaissance. Is there something here worth retrievi=
ng, or do I need to order this and actually dive deep? Since I've probably =
read more about AI than 99% of people at this point, it's less about fillin=
g gaps and more about tracking where the entire field is moving.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=

ere's where things get interesting. I've been learning Swedish=E2=80=94not =
well, but learning. I have this unusual background: I speak English and Ind=
onesian. There's literally nothing written about learning Swedish from an I=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=

makes visible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=

letely different things with books:</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

o fundamentally change how I think=E2=80=94what I call connectome reading. =
I need every word. I need to sit with ideas. AI can help clarify confusing =
parts, but I'm doing the hard work of letting the book rewire my brain.</p>=

 need to make AI decisions but aren't going to code. You're dealing with bo=
ards asking about AI strategy, vendors pitching solutions, teams proposing =
initiatives.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>The pathway starts with basic literacy=
=E2=80=94not to make you technical, but to decode the vocabulary. Then it m=
oves through strategic frameworks. What surprised me is how important the c=
ognitive science books are here. </span><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em><sp=

ccomplish. Not just &quot;summarize this book&quot; but &quot;I'm a founder=
 trying to understand if LLMs are right for my product. What should I focus=
 on?&quot; (And yes, I do sometimes read without AI entirely, and I think t=

 AI like a reading companion. After each chapter: &quot;Help me think about=
 this. What questions should this raise? How does this connect to what I re=
