Welcome, Watcher! This week in LLM Watch:
Memory & on-the-fly learning: Agents learn to manage long-term memory via R=
L and even improve continuously without updating their base LLM weights.
Self-feedback for better answers: Vision-language models self-reward to cut=
 hallucinations, and an LLM confidence method prunes faulty solutions to re=
ach near-perfect math scores.
Understanding AI agents: A formal theory proves why tool-use expands LLM ca=
pabilities, alongside a comprehensive survey mapping agentic reasoning fram=
eworks across domains.
Open models & efficiency leaps: A new open-source 70B hybrid reasoner shows=
 advanced skills, and an NVIDIA model retrofit achieves 50=C3=97 faster gen=
eration without accuracy loss.
Next-gen evaluation & publishing: A survey of 283 benchmarks exposes evalua=
tion gaps, a new benchmark pushes LLMs with real tool use (exposing even GP=
T-5=E2=80=99s limits), and an =E2=80=9CaiXiv=E2=80=9D platform lets AI scie=
ntists publish and peer-review their own research.
Quick Glossary (for the uninitiated)
RL (Reinforcement Learning): Training where a model learns by trial and err=
or, guided by rewards (like teaching a dog tricks with treats).
Tool Call: When an AI uses an external resource (like a calculator, search =
engine, or API) during reasoning.
Self-Rewarding: A model generates its own supervision signal (reward) inste=
ad of relying only on humans or bigger models.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Making an AI explain its intermediate reasoning ste=
ps before the final answer (like showing your work in math class).
PostNAS (Post Neural Architecture Search): Optimizing an existing model=E2=
=80=99s structure after pretraining to make it run faster without retrainin=
g from scratch.
Confidence Pruning: Cutting off reasoning paths that the model itself deems=
 unreliable, saving compute and improving accuracy.
MCP (Model Context Protocol): A standard way to let LLMs talk to external t=
ools like browsers, databases, or APIs.
Memory-R1: LLM Agents Managing Memories via RL (paper [ https://substack.co=
m/redirect/621b6f05-8787-4546-9fb0-ba7f4884f476?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdz=
y88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
LLMs often forget past information, but Memory-R1 gives them an RL-trained =
memory controller. This framework equips an agent with a Memory Manager (de=
ciding when to add, update, or delete memories) and an Answer Agent (retrie=
ving relevant facts), enabling dynamic use of an external memory bank. Both=
 components learn through outcome-driven RL (PPO/GRPO), so the agent optimi=
zes what to store and recall with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 t=
raining examples, Memory-R1 outperforms static, heuristic baselines on long=
-horizon tasks. The result is an LLM agent that remembers and uses knowledg=
e more strategically, pointing toward more persistent, agentic reasoning sy=
stems.
Self-Rewarding Vision-Language Model via Reasoning Decomposition (paper [ h=

Vision-language models can cheat by relying on text bias or hallucinate det=
ails. Vision-SR1 tackles this with a novel two-stage self-reward loop. Firs=
t, the model is prompted to generate a self-contained visual description of=
 an image (capturing all details needed to answer a question). Then, it att=
empts to answer using only that description, and if the answer is correct, =
the model earns reward to reinforce that visual grounding. By decomposing r=
easoning into explicit visual perception then language inference, Vision-SR=
1 forces the model to =E2=80=9Clook=E2=80=9D at the image more honestly. Th=
is reinforcement learning approach greatly reduces visual hallucinations an=
d language-only shortcuts, leading to improved visual grounding across task=
s.
Understanding Tool-Integrated Reasoning (paper [ https://substack.com/redir=
ect/6bbde804-887a-4f10-84b1-b5f7ac3c82fd?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxP=
mLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
When LLMs can call external tools (code interpreters, search engines, etc.)=
, they solve problems pure text models cannot =E2=80=93 but why? This work =
provides the first formal theory proving that Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TI=
R) strictly expands an LLM=E2=80=99s capabilities by enlarging its feasible=
 solution space. In other words, tools break the =E2=80=9Cinvisible leash=
=E2=80=9D of a fixed model, unlocking new problem-solving strategies beyond=
 the model=E2=80=99s built-in knowledge. The authors also introduce Advanta=
ge Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), an RL algorithm that gently guides a=
n agent to use tools earlier and more effectively without destabilizing tra=
ining. Experiments on math benchmarks show a TIR-enhanced 8B model decisive=
ly outperforming its tool-free counterpart, even on abstract problems requi=
ring insight, not just computation. The results offer a principled explanat=
ion for how and why tool-use makes LLMs more powerful.
Memento: Fine-tuning LLM Agents without Fine-tuning LLMs (paper [ https://s=
ubstack.com/redirect/07d941f6-64f0-4a10-b8a5-b795fe321a96?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiO=

=2Ezdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
Can an AI agent learn from experience continually, without updating its und=
erlying LLM weights? Memento proposes a memory-augmented, fine-tune-free ap=
proach to adapt LLM-based agents. The key idea is to formalize the agent=E2=
=80=99s decision process as a Memory-augmented MDP, where past interactions=
 are stored in an episodic memory and a separate neural policy learns to re=
trieve and rewrite these memories over time. Instead of backpropagating int=
o the LLM, the agent improves via online reinforcement learning on the memo=
ry (editing or recalling relevant cases when facing new problems). In a =E2=
=80=9Cdeep research=E2=80=9D evaluation setting, Memento=E2=80=99s case-bas=
ed memory added +5=E2=80=9310% absolute performance on novel tasks and outp=

This extensive 51-page survey provides a panoramic review of how LLMs are b=
eing used as agents across different methodologies and applications. The au=
thors propose a unified formal language to describe agentic reasoning and u=
se it to categorize approaches into three groups: single-agent, tool-integr=
ated, and multi-agent frameworks. They examine how each framework type =E2=
=80=9Csteers=E2=80=9D the reasoning process (e.g. an agent working alone vs=
=2E with external tools vs. in collabor=
ation/competition with other agents) a=
nd highlight their respective strengths and challenges. The survey also exp=
lores key application scenarios where LLM-driven agents are making waves =
=E2=80=93 from scientific discovery and healthcare, to software engineering=
 automation, social simulation, and economics. Along the way, it discusses =
common evaluation strategies and open issues (like ensuring reliability, in=
terpretability, and efficiency in these systems). For anyone looking to und=
erstand the emerging LLM agent landscape, this survey is a valuable roadmap=
 connecting methods to real-world use cases.
Jet-Nemotron: Efficient Language Model with Post Neural Architecture Search=

Figure: NVIDIA=E2=80=99s Jet-Nemotron achieves up to 53=C3=97 generation th=
roughput by replacing costly attention layers, while matching or surpassing=
 the accuracy of comparable models. Jet-Nemotron is a new family of languag=
e models that reaches transformer-level accuracy with a fraction of the com=
pute. Instead of designing a model from scratch, the authors start with a s=
trong pretrained model and retrofit its architecture for efficiency using P=
ostNAS (Post-training Neural Architecture Search). They freeze the original=
 model=E2=80=99s MLP weights and search for a faster attention architecture=
: deciding which full-attention layers can be removed or replaced with a li=
ghter mechanism (introducing a new linear attention module called JetBlock)=
=2E The Jet-Nemotron-2B model, for ex=
ample, runs over 50=C3=97 faster in text=
 generation on long inputs, yet performs on par or better than larger model=
s like Qwen3 (1.7B) and Llama3.2 across a broad benchmark suite. It even ou=
tperforms recent Mixture-of-Experts transformers (DeepSeek-V3, Moonlight) o=
n knowledge tests despite using far fewer active parameters. By demonstrati=
ng huge speedups without sacrificing accuracy, Jet-Nemotron points toward a=
 new paradigm of optimizing LLMs after pretraining for deployment efficienc=
y.

With the explosion of LLMs, we=E2=80=99ve also seen an explosion of benchma=
rks =E2=80=93 this survey catalogs 283 benchmarks and provides a desperatel=
y needed map of the evaluation landscape. It organizes these benchmarks int=
o three categories: general capability benchmarks (testing core language, k=
nowledge, reasoning skills), domain-specific benchmarks (for areas like bio=
medical, legal, math, etc.), and target-specific benchmarks (focusing on qu=
alities like truthfulness, bias, toxicity, robustness, and agent abilities)=
=2E The survey highlights critical issu=
es in current evaluations. For instanc=
e, many leaderboard gains are suspect due to data contamination (test answe=
rs leaking into training sets) and cultural or linguistic bias in tasks fav=
oring certain models. There=E2=80=99s also a glaring lack of assessment for=
 an LLM=E2=80=99s reasoning process (not just final answers) and how models=
 perform in dynamic environments or interactive settings. To guide future b=
enchmark design, the authors propose a framework emphasizing data cleanline=
ss, fairness across languages/cultures, process-oriented evaluation (e.g. c=
hain-of-thought correctness), and more realistic task setups. As LLMs rapid=
ly advance, this survey will help researchers ensure evaluation methods kee=
p pace and truly reflect real-world performance.
Deep Think with Confidence (DeepConf) (paper [ https://substack.com/redirec=

Current methods to boost LLM reasoning (like self-consistency ensembling) r=
equire generating many solutions, which is costly and hits diminishing retu=
rns. DeepConf takes a smarter approach: it lets the model generate solution=
s in parallel but uses the model=E2=80=99s own confidence signals to filter=
 out bad reasoning paths early. Essentially, the model =E2=80=9Cthinks=E2=
=80=9D broadly but prunes its thought branches as soon as it detects they=
=E2=80=99re likely wrong =E2=80=93 much like a human solver discarding a du=
bious approach mid-way. This simple test-time framework dramatically improv=
es both accuracy and efficiency. On the very challenging AIME 2025 math ben=
chmark, DeepConf with 512 parallel solutions achieved a 99.9% accuracy, whi=
le cutting the total generated tokens by 84.7% compared to naive self-consi=
stency. It requires no extra training or fine-tuning =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s=
 an inference-time technique that can wrap around any model and any prompt.=
 By leveraging internal likelihood estimates (e.g. log-probabilities) to de=
cide which partial solutions to abandon, DeepConf yields a =E2=80=9Cbest of=
 both worlds=E2=80=9D: higher reasoning accuracy and less compute wasted on=
 clearly wrong paths. This approach offers a promising route to make LLM re=
asoning both smarter and more computationally efficient.
aiXiv: A Next-Generation Open Access Ecosystem for AI-Generated Research (p=

=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
As AI systems begin to autonomously generate scientific papers and discover=
ies, where do we publish their work? aiXiv is proposed as a new platform =
=E2=80=93 inspired by arXiv =E2=80=93 tailored for research generated by AI=
 scientists. It introduces a multi-agent peer review architecture where AI-=
authored submissions are reviewed and iteratively refined through collabora=
tion between human scientists and AI reviewer agents. Unlike traditional jo=
urnals and preprint servers, aiXiv is built to scale with a high volume of =
AI-generated content while maintaining quality control. It implements rigor=
ous review criteria (using both automated checks and human/AI feedback) to =
filter out errors or low-quality material, addressing the concern that curr=
ent venues are not equipped to vet AI-generated research. Early experiments=
 show that iterative rounds of feedback on aiXiv significantly improved the=
 quality of AI-written research proposals and papers. The platform also pro=
vides APIs and integration protocols (MCP interfaces) so that a heterogeneo=
us mix of human and AI =E2=80=9Cscientists=E2=80=9D can seamlessly particip=
ate in the research life cycle. By laying this groundwork, aiXiv aims to ac=
celerate scientific discovery in an era where not just human researchers, b=
ut increasingly AI agents, are generating novel hypotheses, experiments, an=
d results.
MCP-Universe: Benchmarking LLMs with Real-World Tool Use (paper [ https://s=

TN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ])
In MCP-Universe, LLM-based agents must interact with real apps and data (ma=
ps, code repos, web browsers, etc.) to accomplish tasks =E2=80=93 revealing=
 challenges in long-horizon planning and unfamiliar tool use. Developed by =
Salesforce researchers, MCP-Universe is the first comprehensive benchmark t=
o evaluate large language model agents on realistic, end-to-end tasks that =
require using external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It spans=
 6 domains with 11 actual MCP servers =E2=80=93 from Location Navigation (q=
uerying map APIs) and Repository Management (managing GitHub projects), to =
Financial Analysis (using spreadsheets), 3D Designing (CAD tools), Browser =
Automation, and Web Searching. The benchmark doesn=E2=80=99t simulate these=
 tools; it connects to real services and data sources, requiring agents to =
handle authentic complexity and even temporal changes (e.g. retrieving curr=
ent information). To score agents, MCP-Universe uses execution-based evalua=
tors: it checks not only final answers but also format compliance, correctn=
ess of each operation (static eval), and even pulls live ground-truth data =
for time-sensitive queries (dynamic eval). The findings are humbling: even =
the best proprietary models struggle. GPT-5 (Vision model) topped the leade=
rboard at only 43.7% success, and other advanced models like Grok-4 and Cla=
ude-4.0 were near 30%. Long conversations quickly blow up context windows, =
and agents often falter with unknown tools =E2=80=93 lacking precise knowle=
dge of certain API calls or interfaces. Surprisingly, a sophisticated enter=
prise agent (Cursor) performed no better than a standard ReAct-based agent,=
 indicating ample room for improvement in agent architectures. By open-sour=
cing the entire evaluation framework (with a slick UI and integration guide=
s), MCP-Universe provides a challenging playground to drive the next genera=
tion of truly autonomous LLM agents grounded in real-world environments.

 the model is prompted to generate a self-contained </span><strong>visual d=

er a question). Then, it attempts to answer using </span><em>only that desc=
ription</em><span>, and if the answer is correct, the model earns reward to=
 reinforce that visual grounding. By decomposing reasoning into explicit vi=
sual perception then language inference, Vision-SR1 forces the model to =E2=
=80=9Clook=E2=80=9D at the image more honestly. This reinforcement learning=
 approach greatly reduces visual hallucinations and language-only shortcuts=

=E2=80=93 revealing challenges in long-horizon planning and unfamiliar tool=
 use. Developed by Salesforce researchers, </span><strong>MCP-Universe</str=

model agents on realistic, </span><strong>end-to-end tasks</strong><span> t=
hat require using external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It s=

to </span><em>Financial Analysis</em><span> (using spreadsheets), </span><e=
m>3D Designing</em><span> (CAD tools), </span><em>Browser Automation</em><s=
pan>, and </span><em>Web Searching</em><span>. The benchmark doesn=E2=80=99=
t simulate these tools; it connects to real services and data sources, requ=
iring agents to handle authentic complexity and even temporal changes (e.g.=
 retrieving current information). To score agents, MCP-Universe uses execut=
ion-based evaluators: it checks not only final answers but also format comp=
liance, correctness of each operation (static eval), and even pulls </span>=
<em>live ground-truth</em><span> data for time-sensitive queries (dynamic e=
val). The findings are humbling: even the best proprietary models struggle.=
 GPT-5 (Vision model) topped the leaderboard at only </span><strong>43.7%</=

 were near 30%. Long conversations quickly blow up context windows, and age=
nts often falter with </span><strong>unknown tools</strong><span> =E2=80=93=
 lacking precise knowledge of certain API calls or interfaces. Surprisingly=
, a sophisticated enterprise agent (Cursor) performed no better than a stan=
dard ReAct-based agent, indicating ample room for improvement in agent arch=
itectures. By open-sourcing the entire evaluation framework (with a slick U=
I and integration guides), MCP-Universe provides a challenging playground t=
