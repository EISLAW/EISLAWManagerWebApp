GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: LEADERS AND POLAND'S DEMOGRAPHICS [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
GEORGE FRIEDMAN’S NOTE TO READERS ON NEW SERIES: “THE 2020S AND ITS HISTORIC SHIFT” [4]
Sept. 7, 2025
_Question: No mention of leadership – good, bad or really bad – in Turkey, Russia, Japan, the U.S. and China. Haven’t the leaders of Turkey, Russia and the U.S. caused immeasurable damage to
potential economic growth and political stability in their country and regionally?_
Response: I rarely talk about leaders because I regard them not as the makers of history but as its prisoner. In the case of Donald Trump, for example, I was able to predict what a U.S. president
elected in the 2020s would be like. I wrote about it in several books. I said that the 2020s would be a storm, that the major imperatives for the U.S. would be restructuring the federal government and
universities, and that there would be a deep culture war that would tear the country apart. I came to that conclusion by looking at historical cycles in U.S. institutions and the regular cycles that
led to reconstruction. In addition, I was able to forecast in 2009 that Russia would have to attack to the West, and in particular Ukraine. I was far from perfect in my predictions, but on the whole I
was able to do this by ignoring leaders and studying the forces that shape them and what they must do. So by depersonalizing it, as economists depersonalize economic forces, I was able to call a lot
of things correctly. Leaders are crafters; they obey historical forces and reality and they craft solutions.
I know this is not a sufficient explanation and seems preposterous. I have never written out the method, although I have trained people in it. I haven’t written it because I’m always busy applying
it, and loving the unfolding of history. Still, I am near the final review on my new book, and I intend to have one more book after this, on my method. I do not mean to blow my own horn (well, maybe a
bit, but my wife reviewed this and let it go), but if it is possible to forecast history without knowing who the leader will be, then the leader is only working to specs, and the specs are what
matter. I admit this is a self-serving answer to my leaving out leaders, but however arrogant, it is the answer I have.
-------------------------
POLAND'S EVOLUTION [5]
Sept. 8, 2025
_Question: Poland has real demographic problems, like many countries, but its birth rate is among the lowest in Europe. It won’t remain a major economic or military power for long unless it can
address the issue. What is your take?_
Response: I have written on the American demographic crisis and how it is global. That being the case, Poland is not weakening relative to other countries with the same problem. My argument on this
has been that since we can’t force women to have more babies (insert your favorite joke here), we must increase life expectancy, and more important, have tremendous revolutions in medicine so that
the elderly remain productive rather than simply consuming. There may be a country in the world that does not have plunging birth rates and increasing life expectancy without diminishing productivity,
but I don’t know what it is.
-------------------------
_Question: Assuming Ukraine cannot join NATO, do you see a case for Poland dropping out of NATO in favor of a one-off defense pact with Ukraine? In or out of NATO, Poland is still a formidable bulwark
against Russia, so can it become a partial but effective replacement for NATO for Ukraine? And can Ukraine become a keystone to a defensive eastern glacis that runs from Finland to Turkey?_
Response: Poland is the eastern bulwark against Russia. That won’t change. Leaving NATO would not give it any advantage and would likely weaken it. The countries to the west of Poland, particularly
Germany and Britain (France is going through one of its regular nervous breakdowns), have every interest in making Poland as strong as it can be, as does the United States. Poland cannot move from
where it is, and therefore it needs as much help as it can get. So I don’t see leaving NATO as a rational option. Ukraine cannot itself become a keystone, but it can become a vital buffer between
Russia and NATO, with each side knowing that troops entering Ukraine would be an act of war against the other. As a buffer, Ukraine could become a vital neutral area and flourish economically. But a
military power on Russia’s border would not be acceptable to Russia, nor would Russian troops on the Polish border. Dividing Ukraine would leave a border with NATO and Russia facing each other,
something too close for comfort on either side.
-------------------------
_Question: Several nations led by France are committing to putting troops into Ukraine as a security guarantee after there is a settlement. It also appears that the U.S. may station additional forces
in Poland. Is this the beginning of the settlement? European troops in Ukraine and additional U.S. forces in Poland as a security guarantee for Ukraine? How will Vladimir Putin react to this? It would
seem that, after years of fighting and enormous casualties, this will appear to be a loss because now he will have NATO forces closer to Moscow than before._
Response: Putin attacked Ukraine because he feared the West. His attack was a military failure, and he failed to conquer all but a small part of Ukraine. He has two choices. One is to make peace and
admit that the Russians who died fighting, of which the number is vast, died for nothing. Or he can continue the war and hope, as he did when he started the war, to bring it to a victorious end. He
has chosen his only option: continuing the war in the hope of achieving what he failed to achieve in more than three years. Ending the war without attaining his objective would mean Russia was
defeated, and defeated presidents don’t do well in any country. So he is buying time and hoping for the best, counting not on his infantry but on drones to drive the Ukrainians to surrender. If they
didn’t surrender two or three years ago, they won’t now. I regard Putin as a man in a desperately bad position.

Sept. 7, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: No m=
ention of leadership =E2=80=93 good, bad or really bad =E2=80=93 in Turkey,=
 Russia, Japan, the U.S. and China. Haven=E2=80=99t the leaders of Turkey, =
Russia and the U.S. caused immeasurable damage to potential economic growth=
 and political stability in their country and regionally?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I rarely=
 talk about leaders because I regard them not as the makers of history but =
as its prisoner. In the case of Donald Trump, for example, I was able to pr=
edict what a U.S. president elected in the 2020s would be like. I wrote abo=
ut it in several books. I said that the 2020s would be a storm, that the ma=
jor imperatives for the U.S. would be restructuring the federal government =
and universities, and that there would be a deep culture war that would tea=
r the country apart. I came to that conclusion by looking at historical cyc=
les in U.S. institutions and the regular cycles that led to reconstruction.=
 In addition, I was able to forecast in 2009 that Russia would have to atta=
ck to the West, and in particular Ukraine. I was far from perfect in my pre=
dictions, but on the whole I was able to do this by ignoring leaders and st=
udying the forces that shape them and what they must do. So by depersonaliz=
ing it, as economists depersonalize economic forces, I was able to call a l=
ot of things correctly. Leaders are crafters; they obey historical forces a=
nd reality and they craft solutions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">I know this is not=
 a sufficient explanation and seems preposterous. I have never written out =
the method, although I have trained people in it. I haven=E2=80=99t written=
 it because I=E2=80=99m always busy applying it, and loving the unfolding o=
f history. Still, I am near the final review on my new book, and I intend t=
o have one more book after this, on my method. I do not mean to blow my own=
 horn (well, maybe a bit, but my wife reviewed this and let it go), but if =
it is possible to forecast history without knowing who the leader will be, =
then the leader is only working to specs, and the specs are what matter. I =
admit this is a self-serving answer to my leaving out leaders, but however =
arrogant, it is the answer I have.</p>

Sept. 8, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Pola=
nd has real demographic problems, like many countries, but its birth rate i=
s among the lowest in Europe. It won=E2=80=99t remain a major economic or m=
ilitary power for long unless it can address the issue. What is your take?<=
/em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I have w=
ritten on the American demographic crisis and how it is global. That being =
the case, Poland is not weakening relative to other countries with the same=
 problem. My argument on this has been that since we can=E2=80=99t force wo=
men to have more babies (insert your favorite joke here), we must increase =
life expectancy, and more important, have tremendous revolutions in medicin=
e so that the elderly remain productive rather than simply consuming. There=
 may be a country in the world that does not have plunging birth rates and =
increasing life expectancy without diminishing productivity, but I don=E2=
=80=99t know what it is.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Assu=
ming Ukraine cannot join NATO, do you see a case for Poland dropping out of=
 NATO in favor of a one-off defense pact with Ukraine? In or out of NATO, P=
oland is still a formidable bulwark against Russia, so can it become a part=
ial but effective replacement for NATO for Ukraine? And can Ukraine become =
a keystone to a defensive eastern glacis that runs from Finland to Turkey?<=
/em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Poland i=
s the eastern bulwark against Russia. That won=E2=80=99t change. Leaving NA=
TO would not give it any advantage and would likely weaken it. The countrie=
s to the west of Poland, particularly Germany and Britain (France is going =
through one of its regular nervous breakdowns), have every interest in maki=
ng Poland as strong as it can be, as does the United States. Poland cannot =
move from where it is, and therefore it needs as much help as it can get. S=
o I don=E2=80=99t see leaving NATO as a rational option. Ukraine cannot its=
elf become a keystone, but it can become a vital buffer between Russia and =
NATO, with each side knowing that troops entering Ukraine would be an act o=
f war against the other. As a buffer, Ukraine could become a vital neutral =
area and flourish economically. But a military power on Russia=E2=80=99s bo=
rder would not be acceptable to Russia, nor would Russian troops on the Pol=
ish border. Dividing Ukraine would leave a border with NATO and Russia faci=
ng each other, something too close for comfort on either side.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Seve=
ral nations led by France are committing to putting troops into Ukraine as =
a security guarantee after there is a settlement. It also appears that the =
U.S. may station additional forces in Poland. Is this the beginning of the =
settlement? European troops in Ukraine and additional U.S. forces in Poland=
 as a security guarantee for Ukraine? How will Vladimir Putin react to this=
? It would seem that, after years of fighting and enormous casualties, this=
 will appear to be a loss because now he will have NATO forces closer to Mo=
scow than before.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Putin at=
tacked Ukraine because he feared the West. His attack was a military failur=
e, and he failed to conquer all but a small part of Ukraine. He has two cho=
ices. One is to make peace and admit that the Russians who died fighting, o=
f which the number is vast, died for nothing. Or he can continue the war an=
d hope, as he did when he started the war, to bring it to a victorious end.=
 He has chosen his only option: continuing the war in the hope of achieving=
 what he failed to achieve in more than three years. Ending the war without=
 attaining his objective would mean Russia was defeated, and defeated presi=
dents don=E2=80=99t do well in any country. So he is buying time and hoping=
 for the best, counting not on his infantry but on drones to drive the Ukra=
inians to surrender. If they didn=E2=80=99t surrender two or three years ag=
o, they won=E2=80=99t now. I regard Putin as a man in a desperately bad pos=
ition.</p>
