WHERE BRAZIL STANDS IN THE TRADE WARS [3]
IT ISN’T ALL GOOD NEWS.
BY: ALLISON FEDIRKA
A few countries have found any upside in the recent raft of U.S. tariffs. Brazil is one such country.
The fanfare over its potential success centers on agricultural exports. It’s uniquely suited to be an alternative supplier of agricultural goods to China. Many of the leading U.S. products that go
to China – soy and beef, for example – are also produced and exported from Brazil en masse. The estimates from the National Supply Company suggest soybean production will be 13.6 percent higher
this year [4] compared with last year, resulting in an increase of 7 million tons. History bears out its optimism: During the trade war under the first Trump administration, Brazil gained ground in
China’s agricultural market [5]. Some believe that retaliatory tariffs and market protections against U.S. goods will create even more opportunities for Brazilian agricultural products to be more
competitive.

Its success also centers on bilateral trade with the United States. Brazil has the 10th largest economy in the world [10], with a gross domestic product of $2.13 trillion. Its size gives it a large
consumption base and, critically, more maneuverability in dealing with the U.S. Exports account for approximately 18 percent of Brazil’s GDP, according to the most recent figures from the World Bank
[11]. But the Brazilian government notes [12] that the U.S. accounted for 12 percent of all exports, which is equivalent to 2.16 percent of GDP. Brazil also ranks 17th among the top sources of imports
to the U.S. [13], accounting for about 1.3 percent of all U.S. imports. In other words, Brazil has a comparatively low exposure to the U.S market. The country as a whole is well-positioned to weather
the storm; only the sectors in which the U.S. is a major buyer – steel and ethanol [14], for example, which face 25 percent and 18 percent tariffs, respectively – will be impacted. And perhaps
most fortunately for the government in Brasilia, the U.S. has a bilateral trade surplus with Brazil [15], so from the U.S. perspective, it already has the upper hand.

But agriculture and bilateral trade are the tip of the iceberg. Brazil has adopted a favorable political strategy to help reduce tension with the U.S., thereby making the country less of a target.
When the U.S. included Brazil on its list of blanket tariffs – Brazil received the lowest possible rate of 10 percent – the government didn’t retaliate. In general, the Brazilian government has
responded in a manner specifically meant to avoid provocation. It also maintains a disciplined long-term view on President Donald Trump, who often moderates his stance on trade issues over time. More,
Brazil has opted to collectively negotiate bilateral trade across multiple sectors at the government-to-government level, rather than by individual issue, thereby leveraging Brazil’s massive market
in its favor. For example, it has offered to negotiate a larger quota for U.S. sugar entering the Brazilian market in exchange for lowering the U.S. tariff against Brazilian ethanol.
Trade aside, Brazil has also proved accommodating on irregular migration [18], which the Trump administration has used as the basis for various measures against various countries. Brazil may not be a
major driver of this kind of migration – it ranks eighth in terms of foreign nationals without legal status in the U.S. – but its position in Latin America makes it de facto involved in migration
issues. The Brazilian government has thus coordinated its own humanitarian assistance efforts to receive Brazilians deported from the U.S., prioritizing the safe, respectful return of Brazilian
nationals. Brasilia has also proposed the creation of a working group with Washington to address issues related to deportations.
Another factor that should keep Brazil in America’s good graces is the fact that it is willing to work with Washington on strategic issues. The country’s vice president and commerce minister, for
example, publicly suggested Brazil could help the U.S. reduce its vulnerabilities in strategic areas [19] – things like artificial intelligence and critical minerals – that will be affected by the
U.S.-China trade war. Brazil can be particularly useful on critical minerals; it has large and diverse deposits, and the U.S. has every interest in reducing its reliance on China. Brazil’s National
Mining Association reports that mining firms operating in Brazil are planning to invest a combined $64.5 billion from 2024 to 2028. At the start of 2025, Brazil’s National Development Bank announced
it would provide $815 million in financing [20] in the form of credit lines and equity investments to support the development of strategic mineral supply chains and value-added metal projects in the
country.
In March, Washington confirmed the continuation of a joint research project [21] related to geophysical mapping to identify Brazilian territory rich in critical mineral deposits. Then, only a few
weeks ago, Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira announced plans to launch a national policy [22] regarding critical minerals developments by the end of this year. China, meanwhile, has also
shown a strong interest in mergers and acquisitions [23], particularly in energy, mining and data centers related to AI. Given the size of the Brazilian market and America’s hostility to 5G
development, Washington is more likely to compete with China by engaging Brazil than it is to simply walk away.
But for all the promise Brazil has in the U.S.-China trade war, its economic position at the global level is more of a mixed bag. First, the good. Uncertainty in the U.S. and tariff-induced volatility
will give the country a chance to make a killing on foreign investment. Economic growth and investment are expected to increase over the next couple of years [24], and some firms are issuing
investment studies at the Port of Santos. On the trade front, speculation abounds that the current environment will help Brazil expedite improvements in other trade relationships, particularly in the
Western Hemisphere. Canada has already shown an interest [25] in deepening trade ties with Brazil in agrobusiness, technology and energy. There is also talk that the current environment may help
advance a long-awaited free trade agreement between Canada and Brazil via Mercosur [26]. Similarly, Mexico’s troubles with the U.S. are expected to help accelerate a trade deal with Brazil covering
the automotive sector – a key economic engine for both countries. The general upheaval could also assist Brazil in its desire to modernize and revamp Mercosur into a more effective and flexible
trade bloc.

Now for the bad. Brazil remains highly vulnerable to the negative, secondary effects of the broader U.S. trade wars. Its ability to capitalize on new market opportunities is constrained [31] by
lagging infrastructure, poor logistics, regulatory barriers and inefficient credit guarantees – all of which increase the cost of doing business in Brazil. Though the government has tried to solve
these problems, the chances that it solves them entirely – and quickly – are low. The anticipation of a U.S. recession also bodes ill for Brazil as many, including the monetary policy director at
Brazil’s central bank [32], believe it could trigger a global recession. And while Brazilian exports are expected to remain relatively unaffected by U.S. trade policy, commodity exports – so vital
to its economy – will be sensitive to price fluctuations. And the shifts in global markets have already begun to put downward pressure on some commodity prices [33], including iron ore, oil,
soybeans and sugar.
Another concern is how the response and economic fallout from global tariffs will impact Brazil’s efforts to improve its economy. Inflation has been a persistent problem for Brazil in recent years,
with rising food prices being particularly problematic. There’s concern that the trade wars will result in higher beef exports that will, in turn, drive up the price of meat at home. Moreover, the
prices and competition surrounding input materials that Brazil imports for its agricultural production could drive prices up further. And many remain unclear how various U.S. policies will affect the
value of the dollar and thus the Brazilian currency’s exchange rate. Brazil has tried to incorporate more local currency in its trade, but nothing it has done so far can offset the concerns
surrounding the dollar.
Importantly, the U.S. trade wars will pose a challenge to Brazil’s latest effort to revitalize domestic industry. In 2024, the government announced a federal initiative [34] worth $60 billion to
spur economic growth. The plan focuses on innovating the country’s industrial sector, increasing exports and improving productivity and competitiveness. In the steel industry, for example, the
government raised import taxes on volumes that exceeded quotas. Yet companies have said the measures are not sufficient, and they have expressed concern over a surge in Chinese steel imports [35] and
other Chinese-manufactured goods being dumped into the Brazilian market. Addressing this issue requires a delicate balance between allowing entry of critical input materials and protecting domestic
industry in a way that does not further spur inflation.
This at least helps to explain why Brazilian lawmakers are in the process of passing legislation to help fight foreign trade barriers [36]. The measures seek to protect Brazil’s sovereignty in the
application of trade and investment measures, prevent the violation of benefits granted to Brazil under any trade agreement and allow the government to impose unilateral measures based on
environmental requirements that are beyond the scope of Brazilian law. The bill is admittedly geared to respond to many world economies, not just the U.S.
