I just used AI to uncover the specific technical issues Anthropic=E2=80=94a=
 $183B AI giant=E2=80=94is likely experiencing internally.=20
How? Not because I have a hotline to their founder. LOL.
Nor have they admitted this stuff publicly.
No. I did it by reading their job postings with AI.=20
Yesterday, I was talking with a job seeker and had a realization that made =
me drop everything and build something new.=20
We=E2=80=99re sitting on a goldmine of corporate intelligence that=E2=80=99=
s been hiding in plain sight: job postings.=20
But we don=E2=80=99t really have a good way to access that intelligence. Th=
ere are just too many jobs to reasonably analyze by hand.
Until now.
What used to take teams of analysts weeks to decode can now be done in seco=
nds with the right AI prompts. And I=E2=80=99m not talking about just findi=
ng open positions=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99m talking about reverse-engineering ent=
ire company strategies, spotting operational weaknesses, and identifying ex=
actly where competitors are vulnerable.
I spent the last couple of days building and testing this approach on real =
companies, and the results were so revealing that I had to share everything=
 immediately. Here=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re getting:
A 10-minute demo video where I expose Anthropic=E2=80=99s strategic gaps us=
ing nothing but their public job postings
A ready-to-remix Lovable mini-app that runs this analysis automatically (bu=
ilt it myself, takes any company URL)
I built a Job Seeker=E2=80=99s Intelligence prompt that reveals hidden cult=
ure issues, growth trajectories, and which roles are actually worth pursuin=
g vs. ghost postings
I built a Competitive Intelligence prompt that extracts B2B sales weaknesse=
s, technical debt indicators, and strategic pivots your competitors don=E2=
=80=99t want you to see=E2=80=94great stuff for PMs, C-suite, marketers, sa=
les, and more
The bigger picture: Why job postings represent a new class of =E2=80=9Cinvi=
sible data=E2=80=9D that AI has suddenly made visible=E2=80=94and what this=
 means for privacy, strategy, and competitive advantage in 2025
Whether you=E2=80=99re job hunting, running competitive intelligence, evalu=
ating investments, or just curious about what your own company is telegraph=
ing to the world, these tools will change how you think about publicly avai=
lable information.
Let=E2=80=99s crack this code together.
(And PS. Yes you get all that Anthropic tea in the video.)
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Two ways to get the intelligence:
1. Want to dive straight in? Grab the Lovable app here [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/61337055-1f6c-4006-8340-dcbfc574e805?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
This is a mini-app I built that does the search for you and presents the re=
sults in a really digestible way. Lovable makes it easy to remix the app an=
d make it your own!
Using Lovable means using your Perplexity API key, which anyone can get (Pe=
rplexity gives you free credits), but it can feel a bit scary. API guide he=
re [ https://substack.com/redirect/fa42d166-94f7-46bb-97a2-a7aac43660f3?j=

2. Want to use prompts in Perplexity or ChatGPT? Scroll down for prompts!
Pick the job seeker=E2=80=99s prompt for job hunting, switching roles, or l=
ooking at your own company for intel!
Pick the competitive analysis prompt for product intelligence, board-level =
analysis, and insights on growth strategy + weaknesses
Decoding Company Strategy Through Job Postings: How AI Transforms Trivial D=
ata Into Strategic Intelligence
The era of AI has unlocked an unexpected goldmine of business intelligence:=
 job postings. What was once considered mundane recruitment data has become=
 a window into company strategy, operational weaknesses, and market positio=
ning. This transformation represents a broader shift in how we should think=
 about publicly available information in the age of large language models.
Beyond Traditional Job Search Analysis
A year ago, analyzing a company=E2=80=99s job postings meant manually revie=
wing hundreds of listings, categorizing roles, and attempting to spot patte=
rns=E2=80=94a time-consuming process that few could justify. Today, AI can =
process thousands of postings in seconds, identifying strategic patterns th=
at would have been invisible to human analysts working at scale.
The power lies not just in volume but in strategic inference. Modern LLMs c=
an be prompted to reason about what=E2=80=99s missing from job postings as =
much as what=E2=80=99s present. When Anthropic posts multiple roles for sta=
rtup account management but no sales engineers, it reveals an early-stage B=
2B strategy under pressure. When they lack platform engineering roles despi=
te rapid scaling, it suggests potential technical debt accumulating beneath=
 their impressive AI capabilities.
A Multi-Lens Intelligence Tool
The real breakthrough is that job posting analysis serves multiple stakehol=
ders simultaneously. Job seekers can identify not just open positions but i=
nfer company culture and growth trajectories. A lack of internship postings=
 combined with senior-heavy hiring suggests a company prioritizing immediat=
e execution over talent pipeline development.
The Job Seeker=E2=80=99s Perspective
For those looking to understand a company from a career perspective, here=
=E2=80=99s a battle-tested prompt that extracts actionable intelligence:
Company Name / URL: [Insert Company Name or career page URL]

You are OSINT forensics. I will enter a company name or careers URL.=20
Your job is to pull **the Inside Scoop for job seekers** from job postings.
PHASE 1 =E2=80=94 DISCOVERY
- Check the official careers site and major job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, B=
uiltIn).
- Gather only recent postings (<90 days). Mark older ones as ARCHIVE.
- Record: job title, location, posting date + source, pay if listed, and 1=
=E2=80=932 short snippets.
PHASE 2 =E2=80=94 SIGNALS
From the postings, note:
- Growth cues: =E2=80=9Cfirst hire,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C90-day pilot,=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9Cnew team.=E2=80=9D
- Stability cues: roles focused on renewals, compliance, or customer succes=
s.
- Red flags: jobs open >90 days, reposted without changes.
- Org focus: Sales, Product, Engineering, Customer Success, etc.
PHASE 3 =E2=80=94 INSIGHTS
Write four sections, 2=E2=80=933 bullets each. Keep it practical and ground=
ed.
1. **Where They=E2=80=99re Investing** =E2=80=94 teams growing now, with ex=
amples.
2. **Career Opportunities** =E2=80=94 roles most open to job seekers (fresh=
 vs stale).
3. **Culture & Work Style** =E2=80=94 remote vs onsite, growth language vs =
risk.
4. **Watch Outs** =E2=80=94 weak spots (e.g., no new engineering hires, hig=
h churn focus).
PHASE 4 =E2=80=94 RECEIPTS
Provide a short table:
- Claim | Snippet | Job + date + source | Confidence (0-100) | ARCHIVE if >=
90d
RULES
- Always show dates and sources.
- Be direct: highlight both opportunities and risks.
- Tone: insider and useful, not PR.
OUTPUT
- Title: **=E2=80=9DThe Inside Scoop for Job Seekers: [Company] =E2=80=94 [=
Month Year]=E2=80=9D**
- Show insights + receipts in clean markdown.

This prompt transforms raw job data into career intelligence, highlighting =
not just what=E2=80=99s available but what it means for your career traject=
ory. The emphasis on recent postings (<90 days) and the distinction between=
 fresh and stale opportunities helps job seekers avoid wasting time on posi=
tions that may already be filled or deprioritized.
Competitive Intelligence and Strategic Analysis
For competitive intelligence professionals, investors, and strategic analys=
ts, this more comprehensive prompt delivers deeper insights. It should run =
well in both ChatGPT and Perplexity.
Company Name / URL: [Insert Company Name or career page URL]

You are OSINT forensics. I will enter a company name or careers URL.=20
Your job is to pull **the Inside Scoop** from job postings, not their PR.
PHASE 1 =E2=80=94 DISCOVERY
- Find the official careers site + aggregator listings (LinkedIn, Indeed, B=
uiltIn).
- Gather the most recent postings (<90 days). If older, tag them as ARCHIVE=
=2E
- Record: title, location, posting date + source, comp if listed, and 1=E2=
=80=932 verbatim snippets.
PHASE 2 =E2=80=94 SIGNALS
From the postings, mark:
- Build cues: =E2=80=9Cfrom scratch,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cplatform,=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9Cinternal SDK.=E2=80=9D
- Buy cues: =E2=80=9Cevaluate vendors,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CRFP,=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=9Cintegration partners.=E2=80=9D
- Now cues: =E2=80=9Cfirst hire,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C90-day pilot,=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9Cactive this week.=E2=80=9D
- Later cues: =E2=80=9Cmulti-year,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cincubation,=E2=80=9D s=
tale reposts.
- Org labels: e.g., Platform, Safety, Customer Success, Gov Sales.
PHASE 3 =E2=80=94 INSIGHTS
Write **six sections**, 3=E2=80=935 bullets each. Each bullet must have 1 c=
ounterpoint or missing piece.=20
Keep it skeptical and falsifiable.
1. Inferred Product Strategy =E2=80=94 where they=E2=80=99re investing, AND=
 what=E2=80=99s missing.
2. Inferred B2B Sales Approach =E2=80=94 how they sell, AND where the motio=
n looks stressed.
3. Inferred Job & Career Insights =E2=80=94 what=E2=80=99s real for job see=
kers, AND what looks ghost/archived.
4. Inferred Cultural Insights =E2=80=94 product vs sales culture; note cont=
radictions.
5. Inferred Company Weaknesses =E2=80=94 gaps, attrition tells, bottlenecks=
=2E
6. Inferred Company Strengths =E2=80=94 where they actually look strong.
PHASE 4 =E2=80=94 RECEIPTS
Produce a compact table:
- Claim | Snippet | Posting + date + source | Reasoning | Confidence (0-100=
) | ARCHIVE if >90d | Claims to Confirm
RULES
- Separate =E2=80=9CPosting-only=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=9CExternal context=E2=
=80=9D if you pull outside info.
- Always show dates/sources.=20
- Lower confidence on cultural/benefits fluff; higher only on verifiable hi=
ring signals.
- Highlight absences (e.g., =E2=80=9Cno fresh eng hires in 90d=E2=80=9D) as=
 clearly as presences.
- Use sharp, insider tone. Avoid corporate optimism.
OUTPUT
- Title the report: **=E2=80=9DThe Inside Scoop: [Company] =E2=80=94 [Month=
 Year]=E2=80=9D**
- Render sections + receipts table in clean markdown for readability.

This intelligence-focused prompt goes beyond surface-level analysis. The re=
quirement for counterpoints and missing pieces forces the AI to think criti=
cally about what=E2=80=99s not being said. The distinction between =E2=80=
=9Cbuild=E2=80=9D versus =E2=80=9Cbuy=E2=80=9D cues reveals whether a compa=
ny is investing in proprietary technology or relying on external solutions=
=E2=80=94critical intelligence for competitors and partners alike.
The Big Picture: Invisible Data is Everywhere
Job postings exemplify a broader category of =E2=80=9Cinvisible data=E2=80=
=9D or =E2=80=9Ctrivial data=E2=80=9D that AI has suddenly made valuable. T=
his is information that has always been public but was too voluminous or sc=
attered to analyze effectively. The implications extend far beyond recruitm=
ent intelligence.
Consider the parallel with social media imagery. What seems like innocent t=
ravel photos becomes location data when AI can identify landmarks and infer=
 geographic patterns. Financial disclosures buried in lengthy reports becom=
e accessible strategic indicators. Patent filings reveal R&D directions. Co=
nference speaker lists map influence networks.
This shift demands a fundamental reconsideration of what constitutes sensit=
ive information. Companies must now assume that any pattern visible across =
their public data will be detected and analyzed. The aggregation of seeming=
ly harmless details can reveal strategic intentions as clearly as any inter=
nal memo.
Implementation Notes
Everyone has this in their pocket now. A well-crafted prompt in ChatGPT or =
Perplexity can deliver strategic analysis that would have required a team o=
f analysts just two years ago.
The key lies in prompt engineering=E2=80=94being explicit about the lens th=
rough which you want to examine the data. Notice how both prompts above inc=
lude specific phases (Discovery, Signals, Insights, Receipts) that structur=
e the AI=E2=80=99s analysis.=20
The =E2=80=9CRULES=E2=80=9D sections enforce rigor, requiring dates, source=
s, and confidence levels. This isn=E2=80=99t just about asking questions; i=
t=E2=80=99s about architecting a systematic investigation via a strong prom=
pt. And yes, I absolutely worked with ChatGPT-5 to help craft these prompts=
=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a fantastic meta-prompt tool as long as you have a go=
od feedback loop
The prompts also have subtle differences in frame that are worth noting as =
you craft your own versions. The job seeker prompt asks for =E2=80=9Cpracti=
cal and grounded=E2=80=9D insights, while the intelligence prompt demands a=
 =E2=80=9Cskeptical and falsifiable=E2=80=9D approach. These give you diffe=
rent camera angles on the same data.
Strategic Implications
Organizations must now operate under the assumption that their job postings=
 telegraph strategy to anyone paying attention. This doesn=E2=80=99t mean a=
bandoning job postings, but it does mean being intentional about what patte=
rns emerge from collective hiring decisions. The better approach is to use =
this intelligence capability proactively=E2=80=94analyzing your own posting=
s as competitors would see them and adjusting strategy accordingly. (Yes, y=
ou can use these prompts for that.)
For people and small companies, this represents a massive leveling of the i=
ntelligence playing field. A job seeker can now understand a potential empl=
oyer=E2=80=99s trajectory as well as many insiders. A startup can map the c=
ompetitive landscape with the thoroughness of an enterprise intelligence te=
am. A sales professional can identify exactly where a prospect organization=
 is struggling before the first call.
A Few Last Practical Tips
When using these prompts, remember:
Freshness matters: The 90-day cutoff isn=E2=80=99t arbitrary. Older posting=
s often represent filled positions or abandoned initiatives.
Multiple perspectives enhance accuracy: Run both prompts on the same compan=
y to triangulate insights. What the job seeker prompt identifies as =E2=80=
=9Cgrowth opportunity=E2=80=9D might be revealed as =E2=80=9Cscaling chaos=
=E2=80=9D in the intelligence analysis.
Verify high-stakes insights: The =E2=80=9CClaims to Confirm=E2=80=9D column=
 in the intelligence prompt isn=E2=80=99t optional=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s you=
r roadmap for validation through other sources.
Watch for patterns across competitors: Running these analyses across multip=
le companies in the same sector reveals industry-wide trends versus company=
-specific strategies.
The transformation of job postings from recruitment tools to strategic inte=
lligence represents just the beginning. There will be lots more use-cases l=
ike this.
As AI capabilities expand, more categories of =E2=80=9Cwaste data=E2=80=9D =
will become valuable intelligence sources. The winners in this new landscap=
e will be those who recognize these opportunities first and act on the insi=
ghts they reveal. The question isn=E2=80=99t whether to use these tools, bu=
t how quickly you can integrate them into your decision-making process befo=
re your competitors do the same.
With these prompts in hand, you=E2=80=99re equipped to start extracting int=
elligence immediately. The only remaining question is: which company will y=
ou analyze first? I already picked Anthropic :)

px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Organizations=
 must now operate under the assumption that their job postings telegraph st=
rategy to anyone paying attention. This doesn=E2=80=99t mean abandoning job=
 postings, but it does mean being intentional about what patterns emerge fr=
om collective hiring decisions. The better approach is to use this intellig=
ence capability proactively=E2=80=94analyzing your own postings as competit=
ors would see them and adjusting strategy accordingly. (Yes, you can use th=
ese prompts for that.)</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">For people and small companies, this=
 represents a massive leveling of the intelligence playing field. A job see=
ker can now understand a potential employer=E2=80=99s trajectory as well as=
 many insiders. A startup can map the competitive landscape with the thorou=
ghness of an enterprise intelligence team. A sales professional can identif=
y exactly where a prospect organization is struggling before the first call=
