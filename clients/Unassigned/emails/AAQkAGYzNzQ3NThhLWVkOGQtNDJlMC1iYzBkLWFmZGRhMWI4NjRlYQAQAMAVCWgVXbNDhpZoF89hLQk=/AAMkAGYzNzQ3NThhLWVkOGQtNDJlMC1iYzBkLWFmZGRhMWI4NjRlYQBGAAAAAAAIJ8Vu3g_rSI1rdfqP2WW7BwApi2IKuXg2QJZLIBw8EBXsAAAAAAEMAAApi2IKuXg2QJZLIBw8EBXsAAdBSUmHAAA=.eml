 		 Hey Option Pit Research,

Hannah here, bringing you a Friday headline that may have flown under
your radar.

THE S&P ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WERE NO NEW MEMBERSHIP CHANGES FOR THE
S&P 500 INDEX. THIS IS THE FIRST QUARTERLY REBALANCE WITHOUT ANY
MEMBERSHIP CHANGES TO THE S&P SINCE MARCH 2022.

Hopefully you didn=E2=80=99t own Robinhood or Applovin, both who saw
significant haircuts this morning as news hit they wouldn=E2=80=99t be
joining the =E2=80=9Ccool kids table.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0

In fact, no one is.

Market catalysts like this create opportunities to win - but you have
to know how a S&P 500 rebalance works and why you should care about
it.

S&P 500 TO HOOD/APP: =E2=80=9CNOT TODAY=E2=80=9D

Think of the S&P 500 as America's most exclusive club for corporate
giants.

Like any elite institution, it needs bouncers at the door and regular
membership reviews to stay relevant.

The S&P 500 undergoes constant fine-tuning to make sure it captures
the true pulse of the U.S. economy, kicking out the has-beens and
rolling out the red carpet for tomorrow's titans.

Let=E2=80=99s walk through how it runs=E2=80=A6.=C2=A0

How some companies skip to the front of the line, how some get bottle
service, and how some are thrown out the back door with the garbage.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT

Getting into the S&P 500 is like trying to join an ultra-exclusive
country club where the membership committee doesn't just look at your
bank account=E2=80=94they scrutinize everything.

Companies need a market cap north of $14.6 billion, which is roughly
the GDP of Madagascar last year ($15.8 B).

They must keep at least half their shares floating in public hands,
like a restaurant that needs to keep enough tables open for walk-ins.

Profitability matters too=E2=80=94you need to show black ink for the last
quarter plus the trailing four quarters combined.

The Index Committee meets monthly like a board of financial
kingmakers, wielding complete discretion over who gets the golden
ticket.

It=E2=80=99s important to note that even in the advent and proliferation of
AI, these decisions aren=E2=80=99t made by computers.

Real humans actually meet and debate (can you believe it?!) whether
Tesla belongs next to Microsoft, or if a struggling retailer should
get the boot.

TIMING AND IMPLEMENTATION

Most changes happen quarterly, dropping like clockwork after markets
close on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Last Friday June 6th they dropped their most recent
additions/subtractions (there were none), _more on this in a minute._

It's like Fashion Week for finance=E2=80=94everyone knows when the new
collections drop.

But the committee can also pull emergency moves anytime, like when
Elon Musk bought Twitter and took it private, instantly booting it
from the index.

When changes get announced, there's usually a three-to-five-day
countdown.

The S&P 500 operates on a simple principle: bigger companies get
bigger voices, like shareholders in a corporate democracy.

Apple's movements can swing the entire index because it's the
800-pound gorilla in the room.

For the last two years, we=E2=80=99ve watched the Magnificent 7 basically
dictate the direction of the S&P 500.

ALPHABET, AMAZON, APPLE, META, MICROSOFT, NVIDIA, AND TESLA =E2=80=93 ARE
THE MOST HIGHLY VALUED COMPANIES IN THE STOCK MARKET, AND THEY MAKE UP
ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE S&P 500.

This means if they move, =E2=80=9Cthe market=E2=80=9D moves.

This level of consolidation only happens every ten years or so, and it
moves like a pendulum.

The consolidation will increase til it virtually =E2=80=9Cmaxxes out,=E2=80=
=9D and
then it=E2=80=99ll swing back to =E2=80=9Cnormal,=E2=80=9D with a more even=
 distribution
of companies.

S&P 500 ADDITION AND DELETION PROCESS

Joining the S&P 500 is the corporate equivalent of getting a star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Recent additions like Tesla in 2020 created buying frenzies as index
funds scrambled to snap up shares.

Companies get the axe when they shrink below the size threshold or get
swallowed up in mergers.

It's survival of the financially fittest=E2=80=94corporate natural selection
in real time.

Here's where things get wild, AND WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY IS FOR US AS
TRADERS.

TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH THESE DECISIONS.

When a company joins the S&P 500, it's like suddenly having every
index fund in America become your new best friend, all showing up to
buy your stock at once.

The opposite happens when companies get kicked out=E2=80=94it's a selling
stampede.

This creates a fascinating feedback loop where inclusion in the index
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of success.

The whole system keeps the S&P 500 relevant, and creates quick-hit
option opportunities for smart traders.

RECENT UPDATES: LAST FRIDAY JUNE 6TH

Last Friday, June 6th, delivered a plot twist that nobody saw
coming=E2=80=94the S&P 500 committee took a breather.

For the first time since March 2022, zero new companies got the golden
ticket to join America's most exclusive financial club.

The market had been buzzing with speculation about two particular
darlings: Robinhood (HOOD) and AppLovin (APP).

Both companies had been riding high on Wall Street's expectations,
with investors positioning themselves like paparazzi waiting for
celebrities to walk the red carpet when they were welcomed into the
S&P 500.

Robinhood, the trading app that democratized stock investing for
millennials, seemed like a shoo-in given its cultural impact and
growing market cap.

Not to mention its +120% run since April:

[fopr]

AppLovin, the mobile gaming advertising powerhouse, had been quietly
building the kind of numbers that usually catch the committee's
attention.

[fopr]

Since cratering from February to April=E2=80=A6

It=E2=80=99s surged to almost =E2=80=9Cpre-tariff 2025 levels.=E2=80=9D

When Friday's announcement dropped with no additions, it was like
watching two contestants get voted off the island just before the
finale.

HOOD and APP shares took immediate hits as the "S&P inclusion premium"
evaporated faster than morning dew.

Both are down around -5% TODAY.

The market's reaction highlighted how much modern investing has become
a game of anticipating the index committee's next move.

It's a reminder that even in our algorithmic age, human judgment still
rules the roost=E2=80=94and sometimes that judgment is simply "not today."

So the question becomes: should we buy APP or HOOD? Are they trading
=E2=80=9Cat a discount=E2=80=9D now? And=E2=80=A6 when the next S&P 500 reb=
alance hits,
how can we know which companies could be =E2=80=9CIN=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CO=
UT=E2=80=9D to
