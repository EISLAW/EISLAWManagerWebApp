You=E2=80=99re probably hearing a lot of AI jargon, and you probably sort o=
f know what some of it means . . . but not really. Below is an =E2=80=9Cexp=

 AI terms, drawn from my own understanding, a bunch of research, and feedba=

If you already know all this, no sweat, this post isn=E2=80=99t for you. Fo=

a meeting and you=E2=80=99re struggling to keep up with all the AI words fl=

Model
An AI model is a computer program that is built to work like a human brain.=
 You give it some input (i.e. a prompt), it does some processing, and it ge=
nerates a response.
Like a child, a model =E2=80=9Clearns=E2=80=9D by being exposed to many exa=
mples of how people typically respond or behave in different situations. As=
 it sees more and more examples, it begins to recognize patterns, understan=
d language, and generate coherent responses.
There are many different types of AI models. Some, which focus on language=

LLM (large language model)
LLMs are text-based models, designed to understand and generate human-reada=
ble text. That=E2=80=99s why the name includes the word =E2=80=9Clanguage.=
=E2=80=9D=20
Recently, most LLMs have actually evolved into =E2=80=9Cmulti-modal=E2=80=
=9D models that can process and generate not just text but also images, aud=
io, and other types of content within a single conversational interface. Fo=
r example, all of the ChatGPT LLM models natively support text, images, and=
 even voice. This started with GPT-4o, where =E2=80=9Co=E2=80=9D stands for=
 =E2=80=9Comni=E2=80=9D (meaning it accepts any combination of text, audio,=
 and image input).
Here=E2=80=99s a really good primer on how LLMs actually work [ https://sub=

Transformer
The transformer architecture, developed by Google researchers in 2017, is t=
he algorithmic discovery that made modern AI (and LLMs in particular) possi=
ble.
Transformers introduced a mechanism called =E2=80=9Cattention,=E2=80=9D whe=
re instead of only being able to read text word=E2=80=91by=E2=80=91word, se=
quentially, the model is able to look at all the words at once. This helps =
the models understand how words relate to each other, making them far bette=
r at capturing meaning, context, and nuance than earlier techniques.
Another big advantage of the transformer architecture is that it=E2=80=99s =
highly parallelizable=E2=80=94it can process many parts of a sequence at th=
e same time. This makes it possible to train much bigger and smarter models=
 simply by scaling up the data and compute power. This breakthrough is why =
we suddenly went from basic chatbots to sophisticated AI assistants. Almost=
 every major AI model today, including ChatGPT and Claude, is built on top =
of the transformer architecture.
This is the best explanation of transformers [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/1f7b0890-a9c3-475b-bde9-b90310a10472?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmL=
QJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] I=E2=80=99ve seen. Here=E2=80=99s also a =
more technical and visual deep dive:
Training/Pre-training
Training is the process by which an AI model learns by analyzing massive am=
ounts of data. This data might include large portions of the internet, ever=
y book ever published, audio recordings, movies, video games, etc. Training=
 state-of-the-art models can take weeks or months, require processing terab=
ytes of data, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
For LLMs, the core training method is called =E2=80=9Cnext-word prediction.=
=E2=80=9D The model is shown billions of text sequences with the last word =
hidden, and it learns to predict what word should come next.=20
As it trains, the model adjusts millions of internal settings called =E2=80=
=9Cweights.=E2=80=9D These are similar to how neurons in the human brain st=
rengthen or weaken their connections based on experience. When the model ma=
kes a correct prediction, those weights are reinforced. When it makes an in=
correct one, they=E2=80=99re adjusted. Over time, this process helps the mo=
del improve its understanding of facts, grammar, reasoning, and how languag=
e works in different contexts. Here=E2=80=99s a quick visual explanation [ =
https://substack.com/redirect/06b78f30-4e5e-4f6b-a53e-2c4bab1f168d?j=3DeyJ1=
IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
If you=E2=80=99re skeptical of next-word prediction generating novel insigh=
ts and super-intelligent AI systems, here=E2=80=99s Ilya Sutskever (co-foun=
der of OpenAI) explaining why it=E2=80=99s deceptively powerful:
Supervised learning
Supervised learning refers to when a model is trained on =E2=80=9Clabeled=
=E2=80=9D data=E2=80=94meaning the correct answers are provided. For exampl=
e, the model might be given thousands of emails labeled =E2=80=9Cspam=E2=80=
=9D or =E2=80=9Cnot spam=E2=80=9D and, from that, learn to spot the pattern=
s that distinguish spam from non-spam. Once trained, the model can then cla=
ssify new emails it=E2=80=99s never seen before.
Most modern language models, including ChatGPT, use a subtype called =E2=80=
=9Cself-supervised learning.=E2=80=9D Instead of relying on human-labeled d=
ata, the model creates its own labels, generally by hiding the last word of=
 a sentence and learning to predict it. This allows it to learn from massiv=
e amounts of raw text without manual annotation.
Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is the opposite: the model is given data without any =
labels or answers. Its job is to discover patterns or structure on its own,=
 like grouping similar news articles together or detecting unusual patterns=
 in a dataset. This method is often used for tasks like anomaly detection, =
clustering, and topic modeling, where the goal is to explore and organize i=
nformation rather than make specific predictions.
Post-training
Post-training refers to all of the additional steps taken after training is=
 complete to make the model even more useful. This includes steps like =E2=
=80=9Cfine-tuning=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CRLHF.=E2=80=9D
Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is a post-training technique where you take a trained model and=
 do additional training on specific data that=E2=80=99s tailored to what yo=
u want the model to be especially good at. For example, you would fine-tune=
 a model on your company=E2=80=99s customer service conversations to make i=
t respond in your brand=E2=80=99s specific style, or on medical literature =
to make it better at answering healthcare questions, or on educational cont=
ent for specific grade levels to create a tutoring assistant that explains =
concepts in age-appropriate ways.
This additional training tweaks the model=E2=80=99s internal weights to spe=
cialize its responses for your specific use case, while preserving the gene=
ral knowledge it learned during pre-training.=20
Here=E2=80=99s an awesome technical deep dive into how fine-tuning works:
RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback)
RLHF is a post-training technique that goes beyond next-word prediction and=
 fine-tuning by teaching AI models to behave the way humans want them to=E2=
=80=94making them safer, more helpful, and aligned with our intentions. RLH=
F is the key method used for what=E2=80=99s referred to as =E2=80=9Calignme=
nt.=E2=80=9D
This process works in two stages: First, human evaluators compare pairs of =
outputs and choose which is better, training a =E2=80=9Creward model=E2=80=
=9D that learns to predict human preferences. Then, the AI model learns thr=
ough reinforcement learning=E2=80=94a trial-and-error process where it rece=
ives =E2=80=9Crewards=E2=80=9D from the reward model (not directly from hum=
ans) for generating responses the reward model predicts humans would prefer=
=2E In this second stage, the model=
 is essentially trying to =E2=80=9Cgame=E2=
=80=9D the reward model to get higher scores.
Here=E2=80=99s a great guide [ https://substack.com/redirect/c60b227f-0016-=

6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], plus this technical deep dive into RLHF:
Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting questions (i.e. =E2=
=80=9Cprompts=E2=80=9D) for AI models that result in better and more useful=
 responses. Like when you=E2=80=99re talking to a person, the way you phras=
e your question can lead to dramatically different responses. The same AI m=
odel will give very different responses based on how you craft your prompt.
There are two categories of prompts:
Conversational prompts: What you send ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini when you=E2=80=
=99re having a conversation with it
System/product prompts: The behind-the-scenes instructions that developers =
bake into products to shape how the AI product behaves
Here=E2=80=99s a podcast episode from just last week where we cover this an=
d much more:
RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
RAG is a technique that gives models access to additional information at ru=
n-time that they weren=E2=80=99t trained on. It=E2=80=99s like giving the m=
odel an open-book test instead of having it answer from memory.
When you ask a question like =E2=80=9CHow do this month=E2=80=99s sales com=
pare to last month?=E2=80=9D a retrieval system is able to search through y=
our databases, documents, and knowledge repos to find pertinent information=
=2E This retrieved data is then added a=
s context to your original prompt, cre=
ating an enriched prompt that the model then processes. This leads to a muc=
h better, more accurate answer.
If you don=E2=80=99t give the model the context it needs to answer your que=
stion through RAG, this is when =E2=80=9Challucinations=E2=80=9D happen (se=
e more below).
Broadly, to summarize:
Pre-training: Teaches the model general knowledge (and language)
Fine-tuning: Specializes the model for specific tasks
RLHF: Aligns the model with human preferences
Prompt engineering: The skills of crafting better inputs to guide the model=
 toward the most useful outputs
RAG: A technique that retrieves additional relevant information from extern=
al sources at run-time to give the model up-to-date or task-specific contex=
t it wasn=E2=80=99t trained on
Here=E2=80=99s a great overview of fine-tuning vs. RAG vs. prompt engineeri=
ng:
Inference
Inference is when the model =E2=80=9Cruns.=E2=80=9D When you ask ChatGPT a =
question and it generates a response, that=E2=80=99s it doing inference.
MCP (model context protocol)
MCP is a recently released open standard that allows AI models to interact =
with external tools=E2=80=94like your calendar, CRM, Slack, or codebase=E2=
=80=94easily, reliably, and securely. Previously, developers had to write t=
heir own custom code for each new integration.
MCP also gives the AI the ability to take actions through these tools, for =
example, updating customer records in Salesforce, sending messages in Slack=
, scheduling meetings in your calendar, or even committing code to GitHub.
It=E2=80=99s still early in the definition of AI protocols, and there are o=
ther competing proposals, like A2A from Google and ACP from BeeAI/IBM.
Here=E2=80=99s a really nice in-depth explanation of MCP:...

s in particular) possible.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

 read text word=E2=80=91by=E2=80=91word, sequentially, the model is able to=
 look at all the words at once. This helps the models understand how words =

=E2=80=94it can process many parts of a sequence at the same time. This mak=
es it possible to train much bigger and smarter models simply by scaling up=
 the data and compute power. This breakthrough is why we suddenly went from=
