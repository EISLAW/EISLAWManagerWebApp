Welcome, Watcher!
This week, we're exploring three developments that reshape how AI models th=
ink, verify, and compete in the rapidly evolving landscape.
First, Qwen3 brilliantly tackles the tension between "thinking deep" and "a=
cting fast" with its innovative hybrid thinking design. From tiny 0.6B mode=
ls to the massive 235B flagship, this family offers both careful reasoning =
and rapid response modes across 119 languages, democratizing access to powe=
rful AI while letting users dial between computation budget and performance=
 needs.
Next, ThinkPRM introduces a generative approach to verifying AI reasoning t=
hat outperforms traditional methods with just 1% of the training data. By t=
eaching verifiers to "think" through their own chain-of-thought, this break=
through makes reliable reasoning verification more accessible, interpretabl=
e, and scalable for real-world applications.
Finally, "The Leaderboard Illusion" pulls back the curtain on how major AI =
providers game the Chatbot Arena. Their rigorous audit reveals how asymmetr=
ic data access, private model variants, and silent model retirements distor=
t what should be an objective measure of progress - an important reminder t=
hat benchmarks themselves need careful design to remain meaningful.
The underlying trends? Democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities, fi=
nding more efficient paths to reliable reasoning, and ensuring transparency=
 in how we measure progress. Whether balancing depth and speed, reimagining=
 verification, or maintaining benchmark integrity, these developments all p=
oint toward making powerful AI both more accessible and more trustworthy.

1. Qwen3: Think Deeper, Act Faster
Watching: Qwen3 (blog [ https://substack.com/redirect/d041d5d7-4f08-4773-b8=
2c-1e9bcf26609b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tA=
jMRMPOw0 ]/code [ https://substack.com/redirect/60dec48c-58be-4d59-ac9d-3ff=
d9fd83383?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPO=
w0 ])
What problem does it solve? Large language models today often force users t=
o choose between =E2=80=9Cthinking deep=E2=80=9D (high-quality reasoning bu=
t slow and costly) and =E2=80=9Cacting fast=E2=80=9D (quick replies but sha=
llow understanding). Bigger models give better answers but eat up compute, =
while smaller ones are cheap but struggle on tough tasks. Practitioners nee=
d flexible, efficient models that scale smoothly from tiny devices to massi=
ve servers, support long contexts and many languages, and balance speed, co=
st, and reasoning depth.
How does it solve the problem? The Qwen3 family - a spectrum of dense and M=
ixture-of-Experts (MoE) models from 0.6B to a 235B-parameter flagship - com=
es with a novel =E2=80=9Chybrid thinking=E2=80=9D design. Each model suppor=
ts two modes: a careful, step-by-step reasoning mode and a rapid =E2=80=9Ci=
nstant answer=E2=80=9D mode. They pre-trained on 36 trillion tokens across =
119 languages, then post-trained in four stages (chain-of-thought cold star=
t, reinforcement learning for reasoning, fusion of thinking/non-thinking sk=
ills, and broad RL for general tasks). This pipeline, plus sparse activatio=
n in MoE variants and context windows up to 128K tokens, ensures both effic=
iency and high capability.
What are the key findings? Qwen3-235B-A22B matches or outperforms leading m=
odels like Gemini-2.5-Pro on coding, math, and general benchmarks. The smal=
ler MoE model, Qwen3-30B-A3B, beats a 32B dense counterpart while only acti=
vating 3B parameters. Even Qwen3-4B rivals a 72B model from Qwen2.5. Dense =
Qwen3-base models achieve the same or better performance as much larger Qwe=
n2.5 bases, especially in STEM and reasoning. Overall, users can seamlessly=
 dial between reasoning budget and latency, and enjoy support for 119 langu=
ages and ultra-long contexts.
Why does it matter? By offering high accuracy with dramatically reduced act=
ive compute, Qwen3 democratizes state-of-the-art LLMs - making them accessi=
ble on more hardware and budgets. The hybrid thinking modes let developers =
tailor cost versus quality on a per-task basis. Broad multilingual coverage=
 and long-context handling unlock new global and document-heavy application=
s. Altogether, Qwen3 moves us closer to adaptable, efficient AI agents that=
 can both think deeply when needed and respond instantly when speed matters=

2. Process Reward Models That Think
Watching:  ThinkPRM (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/1f25f1dd-bef5-4d=
49-be71-bf1950f6126f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6R=

MRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Large language models often =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=
=80=9D through problems by exploring many possible solution paths, but deci=
ding which path is actually correct requires a verifier - or process reward=
 model (PRM) - that judges each reasoning step. Traditional PRMs are =E2=80=
=9Cdiscriminative=E2=80=9D classifiers trained on massive step-by-step anno=
tations, making them expensive and slow to scale at test time. Meanwhile, u=
sing an off-the-shelf LLM =E2=80=9Cas a judge=E2=80=9D is data-efficient bu=
t unreliable: it can hallucinate, overthink, or loop infinitely when checki=
ng complex reasoning.
How does it solve the problem? ThinkPRM is a generative verifier that itsel=
f =E2=80=9Cthinks=E2=80=9D through a detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) to che=
ck each step of a solution. Starting from open-weight reasoning models, the=
y generate a small synthetic dataset of high-quality verification CoTs - on=
ly 1 000 examples matched to gold step labels - and fine-tune via low-rank =
adapters (LoRA). At test time, ThinkPRM can be sampled multiple times (best=
-of-N) or prompted to =E2=80=9Cverify again=E2=80=9D to dynamically scale i=
ts checking compute without retraining.
What are the key findings? ThinkPRM, trained on just 1 % of the data used b=
y discriminative PRMs, outperforms both LLM-as-a-judge and discriminative b=
aselines by up to 8 F1 points on in-domain benchmarks (ProcessBench, MATH-5=
00, AIME =E2=80=9924). It also generalizes better out-of-domain (science QA=
 and code generation), boosting accuracy by 4=E2=80=938 points despite usin=
g far fewer labels. Moreover, ThinkPRM=E2=80=99s generative design lets it =
leverage extra inference compute - sampling more CoTs or self-correcting - =
to yield further gains.
Why does it matter? By showing that a generative, chain-of-thought verifier=
 can match or beat heavyweight discriminative models with minimal supervisi=
on, this work paves the way for more interpretable, data-efficient, and com=
pute-scalable checking of LLM reasoning. In practice, THINK PRM makes it fa=
r cheaper to deploy reliable step-by-step verifiers, unlocking robust real-=
world applications of LLMs in education, math, science, and beyond.
3. The Leaderboard Illusion
Watching: Leaderboard Illusion (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/88242=

What problem does it solve? Chatbot Arena is a live, human=E2=80=90voted le=
aderboard for comparing AI chatbots, but it=E2=80=99s been distorted by a h=
andful of big providers. These companies quietly run dozens of private mode=
l variants, choose only their highest scores to publish, sample their model=
s far more often, and silently retire weaker ones. As a result, the leaderb=
oard no longer reflects true model quality - winning the Arena has become m=
ore about gaming the system than about genuine progress.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers performed a comprehensive au=
dit of over 2 million battles from January 2024 to April 2025, combining pu=
blic and privately shared datasets. By scraping random battles and probing =
models to reveal hidden names, they mapped out private testing practices an=
d measured each provider=E2=80=99s sampling rate. They ran statistical simu=
lations of best=E2=80=90of=E2=80=90N selection bias, conducted real=E2=80=
=90world experiments with identical checkpoints, and examined how unannounc=
ed deprecations violate the Bradley=E2=80=93Terry ranking assumptions under=
 a shifting prompt distribution.
What are the key findings? They found extreme data=E2=80=90access asymmetri=
es: Meta ran 27 private variants, Google and OpenAI each captured over 19 %=
 of all vote data, while 83 open-source models shared just 29.7 %. Even lim=
ited additional Arena data boosted a small model=E2=80=99s win-rate by up t=
o 112 % on in-distribution tests. Moreover, 205 of 243 public models were s=
ilently deprecated - four times the number officially listed -creating frag=
mented match graphs and unreliable rankings.
Why does it matter? These dynamics exemplify Goodhart=E2=80=99s Law: once b=
enchmark scores become a target, they lose their value as measures of real =
progress. Left unchecked, the Arena rewards tactical overfitting and concen=
trates benefits in a few hands, eroding trust and misguiding research. By o=
utlawing score retraction, capping private variants, enforcing clear retire=
ment rules, and adopting fair sampling, Chatbot Arena can restore its role =
as a transparent, scientifically sound measure of AI capability.

AutoJudge accelerates LLM inference via lossy speculative decoding, using s=
emi-greedy search and a lightweight classifier to accept mismatches. On GSM=
8K (Llama 3.2 1B/8B), it achieves 1.5x speedup with minimal answer accuracy=
 degradation. Applied to LiveCodeBench, AutoJudge identifies programming-sp=
ecific important tokens, generalizing across tasks while maintaining speedu=

height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This week, we're exploring three development=
s that reshape how AI models think, verify, and compete in the rapidly evol=
ving landscape.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First, Qwen3 brilliantly tackles the tensio=
n between &quot;thinking deep&quot; and &quot;acting fast&quot; with its in=
novative hybrid thinking design. From tiny 0.6B models to the massive 235B =
flagship, this family offers both careful reasoning and rapid response mode=
s across 119 languages, democratizing access to powerful AI while letting u=
sers dial between computation budget and performance needs.</p><p style=3D"=
margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"=
>Next, ThinkPRM introduces a generative approach to verifying AI reasoning =
that outperforms traditional methods with just 1% of the training data. By =
teaching verifiers to &quot;think&quot; through their own chain-of-thought,=
 this breakthrough makes reliable reasoning verification more accessible, i=
nterpretable, and scalable for real-world applications.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Fin=
ally, &quot;The Leaderboard Illusion&quot; pulls back the curtain on how ma=
jor AI providers game the Chatbot Arena. Their rigorous audit reveals how a=
symmetric data access, private model variants, and silent model retirements=
 distort what should be an objective measure of progress - an important rem=
inder that benchmarks themselves need careful design to remain meaningful.<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">The underlying trends? Democratizing access to powerful AI =
capabilities, finding more efficient paths to reliable reasoning, and ensur=
ing transparency in how we measure progress. Whether balancing depth and sp=
eed, reimagining verification, or maintaining benchmark integrity, these de=
velopments all point toward making powerful AI both more accessible and mor=

 distorted by a handful of big providers. These companies quietly run dozen=
s of private model variants, choose only their highest scores to publish, s=
ample their models far more often, and silently retire weaker ones. As a re=

 The researchers performed a comprehensive audit of over 2 million battles =
from January 2024 to April 2025, combining public and privately shared data=
sets. By scraping random battles and probing models to reveal hidden names,=
 they mapped out private testing practices and measured each provider=E2=80=
=99s sampling rate. They ran statistical simulations of best=E2=80=90of=E2=
=80=90N selection bias, conducted real=E2=80=90world experiments with ident=
ical checkpoints, and examined how unannounced deprecations violate the Bra=
dley=E2=80=93Terry ranking assumptions under a shifting prompt distribution=
.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings? </strong><span>=
They found extreme data=E2=80=90access asymmetries: Meta ran 27 private var=
iants, Google and OpenAI each captured over 19 % of all vote data, while 83=
 open-source models shared just 29.7 %. Even limited additional Arena data =
boosted a small model=E2=80=99s win-rate by up to 112 % on in-distribution =
tests. Moreover, 205 of 243 public models were silently deprecated - four t=
imes the number officially listed -creating fragmented match graphs and unr=
eliable rankings.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=

g><span> These dynamics exemplify Goodhart=E2=80=99s Law: once benchmark sc=

ore retraction, capping private variants, enforcing clear retirement rules,=
 and adopting fair sampling, Chatbot Arena can restore its role as a transp=
