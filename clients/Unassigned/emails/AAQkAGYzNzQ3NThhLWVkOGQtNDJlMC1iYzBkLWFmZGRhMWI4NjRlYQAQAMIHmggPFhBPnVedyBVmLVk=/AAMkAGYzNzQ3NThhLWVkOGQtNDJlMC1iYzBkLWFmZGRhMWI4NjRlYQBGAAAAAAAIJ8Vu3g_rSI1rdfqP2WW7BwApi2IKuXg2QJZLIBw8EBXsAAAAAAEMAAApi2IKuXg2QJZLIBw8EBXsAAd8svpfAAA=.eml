POLAND’S EVOLUTION [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
In the years prior to writing “The Next 100 Years” (published in 2009), I viewed Poland as a nation that had not really recovered from World War II because of Soviet domination during the Cold
War. At the same time, its public had retained both resentment of Russia and a deeply nationalist feeling, and I saw that with Russia's withdrawal, these cultural forces and its exposure on the
eastern edge of NATO would make Poland's security vital to NATO. While other European nations with less geopolitical exposure and less cynicism about the future of Russia’s post-Soviet evolution in
effect relaxed, Poland would be forced to assert itself. I thus saw it as an emerging and significant power that would be forced into greater dynamism than other European countries.
Last week, Polish President Karol Nawrocki asked U.S. President Donald Trump to include Poland in the G20, a group that consists of the 20 largest economies in the world. The United States will take
over as chair of the group in December, and Trump assured Nawrocki that Poland would gain membership, given that Poland’s gross domestic product ($914.7 billion as of 2024) will reach the
trillion-dollar mark in 2025, making it the 20th-largest economy in the world. Poland at this point also has the third-largest military in NATO, behind only the United States and Turkey in size,
having undergone a rapid and significant evolution of its technical warfighting capabilities. Given the condition of Poland in 1989, when the Solidarity movement overthrew the communist regime,
Poland’s transformation has been extraordinary both economically and militarily.
Poland's evolution has significant geopolitical and strategic importance. Sitting on Ukraine's western border, Poland is the easternmost country between France and Germany on the one hand and Russia
on the other, and forms the southern flank of NATO’s Baltic members. It is the most strategically important country in Russia's confrontation with Europe. That importance was initially a major
strategic vulnerability for Poland. It made economic and military growth imperative. Poland has today certainly become one of the most dynamic countries in Europe, given that it was among the
region’s poorest countries in 1989.
Poland is critical in any settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war. Russia’s fundamental demand is that no NATO members be allowed to deploy troops to Ukraine, in addition to limiting the size of
Ukraine’s own military. The demand may appear unreasonable in the extreme, but it flows from Russia’s need for Ukraine to act as a buffer, while a Russian victory in Ukraine would give it a base
from which to threaten the Baltics. It would seem that however distant a Russian victory in Ukraine is, and whatever the military and economic price Russia must pay, Moscow will not end the war
without that guarantee, as it regards NATO forces at the Russia-Ukraine border – peacekeepers or not – as a fundamental threat to Russia. If it cannot conquer Ukraine as a whole and must abandon
any further ambitions in the Baltics, then Russia must have Ukraine as a demilitarized buffer zone. Many view Russia as having only offensive goals in Ukraine, and though they certainly played a role,
Moscow also has defensive goals. These ambitions have become much more important as the offensive goals, after more than three years, are clearly now out of reach. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s
resistance to peace is based on fear as much as greed.
Therefore, Poland becomes the critical country. If Ukraine remains independent but a demilitarized zone, Russia might choose at a later date to invade Ukraine again, and so a U.S. or European
agreement to Putin’s terms is impossible. However, if the choice is between continuing the war indefinitely (given Russia’s fears and potential ambitions) and reaching an agreement based on
Ukrainian neutralization, Poland can become a guarantor of both peace in Ukraine and Ukrainian neutrality.
Any renewal of the war by Russia would be visible before an attack, as shifting from a defensive to an offensive force can be readily observed from satellites. The days when war preparation could be
hidden are over. That would mean that Polish troops and other forces based in Poland could either preempt a Russian assault or, following an attack, rapidly enter Ukraine and engage Russian forces on
the ground and with drones. This would be an alternative to basing troops in Ukraine, yet it would still provide the ability to rapidly counter a Russian attack.
There are risks to this sort of agreement, of course, but the fact that Russia is prepared to continue the war at significant cost to lives and economic development indicates not how powerful Russia
is but how desperate Putin is. He is desperate not to give up in Ukraine, with all that he lost as the only outcome. For their part, the U.S. and Europe do not want the war to continue out of fear of
an unlikely but possible Ukrainian collapse. And if the Europeans want only to occupy a neutral and peaceful Ukraine, rather than engage Russia in high-intensity warfare, there is a possibility that
Europe – and, more eagerly, the United States – could agree to Russian demands for a demilitarized Ukraine.
But this would be dependent on the ability of troops in Poland to rapidly enter Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian invasion and to engage the Russians. Given the last few years, Russia might
not be willing to face Polish and American troops. The U.S. has 10,000 troops in Poland now, and Trump has promised more troops to Poland in the future. Given the choice that Putin is putting on the
table – a continued war or a neutralized Ukraine – it is not certain that the choice won’t be continued warfare. At the same time, the evolution of Polish power has provided a possible
alternative, particularly given U.S. participation.
In any case, the dramatic expansion of Poland’s economic and military power has created a new reality in which Poland, with U.S. backing, is the pivot and the counter to future Russian aggression,
with or without other European aid. Indeed, as Polish power continues to expand, based on a rapidly growing economy, Poland can become – and perhaps already is – a significant deterrent to Russian
action. In the not-too-distant future, its geography and capability could make Poland emerge as a very significant power in the region. It’s not quite there yet, but this is still a radical change
in the geopolitics of Europe.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the years prior=
 to writing =E2=80=9CThe Next 100 Years=E2=80=9D (published in 2009), I vie=
wed Poland as a nation that had not really recovered from World War II beca=
use of Soviet domination during the Cold War. At the same time, its public =
had retained both resentment of Russia and a deeply nationalist feeling, an=
d I saw that with Russia's withdrawal, these cultural forces and its exposu=
re on the eastern edge of NATO would make Poland's security vital to NATO. =
While other European nations with less geopolitical exposure and less cynic=
ism about the future of Russia=E2=80=99s post-Soviet evolution in effect re=
laxed, Poland would be forced to assert itself. I thus saw it as an emergin=
g and significant power that would be forced into greater dynamism than oth=
er European countries.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last week, Polish =
President Karol Nawrocki asked U.S. President Donald Trump to include Polan=
d in the G20, a group that consists of the 20 largest economies in the worl=
d. The United States will take over as chair of the group in December, and =
Trump assured&nbsp;Nawrocki that Poland would gain membership, given that P=
oland=E2=80=99s gross domestic product ($914.7 billion as of 2024) will rea=
ch the trillion-dollar mark in 2025, making it the 20th-largest economy in =
the world. Poland at this point also has the third-largest military in NATO=
, behind only the United States and Turkey in size, having undergone a rapi=
d and significant evolution of its technical warfighting capabilities. Give=
n the condition of Poland in 1989, when the Solidarity movement overthrew t=
he communist regime, Poland=E2=80=99s transformation has been extraordinary=
 both economically and militarily.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Poland's evolution=
 has significant geopolitical and strategic importance. Sitting on Ukraine'=
s western border, Poland is the easternmost country between France and Germ=
any on the one hand and Russia on the other, and forms the southern flank o=
f NATO=E2=80=99s Baltic members. It is the most strategically important cou=
ntry in Russia's confrontation with Europe. That importance was initially a=
 major strategic vulnerability for Poland. It made economic and military gr=
owth imperative. Poland has today certainly become one of the most dynamic =
countries in Europe, given that it was among the region=E2=80=99s poorest c=
ountries in 1989.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Poland is critical=
 in any settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war. Russia=E2=80=99s fundamental =
demand is that no NATO members be allowed to deploy troops to Ukraine, in a=
ddition to limiting the size of Ukraine=E2=80=99s own military. The demand =
may appear unreasonable in the extreme, but it flows from Russia=E2=80=99s =
need for Ukraine to act as a buffer, while a Russian victory in Ukraine wou=
ld give it a base from which to threaten the Baltics. It would seem that ho=
wever distant a Russian victory in Ukraine is, and whatever the military an=
d economic price Russia must pay, Moscow will not end the war without that =
guarantee, as it regards NATO forces at the Russia-Ukraine border =E2=80=93=
 peacekeepers or not =E2=80=93 as a fundamental threat to Russia. If it can=
not conquer Ukraine as a whole and must abandon any further ambitions in th=
e Baltics, then Russia must have Ukraine as a demilitarized buffer zone. Ma=
ny view Russia as having only offensive goals in Ukraine, and though they c=
ertainly played a role, Moscow also has defensive goals. These ambitions ha=
ve become much more important as the offensive goals, after more than three=
 years, are clearly now out of reach. Russian President Vladimir Putin=E2=
=80=99s resistance to peace is based on fear as much as greed.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Therefore, Poland =
becomes the critical country. If Ukraine remains independent but a demilita=
rized zone, Russia might choose at a later date to invade Ukraine again, an=
d so a U.S. or European agreement to Putin=E2=80=99s terms is impossible. H=
owever, if the choice is between continuing the war indefinitely (given Rus=
sia=E2=80=99s fears and potential ambitions) and reaching an agreement base=
d on Ukrainian neutralization, Poland can become a guarantor of both peace =
in Ukraine and Ukrainian neutrality.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Any renewal of the=
 war by Russia would be visible before an attack, as shifting from a defens=
ive to an offensive force can be readily observed from satellites. The days=
 when war preparation could be hidden are over. That would mean that Polish=
 troops and other forces based in Poland could either preempt a Russian ass=
ault or, following an attack, rapidly enter Ukraine and engage Russian forc=
es on the ground and with drones. This would be an alternative to basing tr=
oops in Ukraine, yet it would still provide the ability to rapidly counter =
a Russian attack.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There are risks to=
 this sort of agreement, of course, but the fact that Russia is prepared to=
 continue the war at significant cost to lives and economic development ind=
icates not how powerful Russia is but how desperate Putin is. He is despera=
te not to give up in Ukraine, with all that he lost as the only outcome. Fo=
r their part, the U.S. and Europe do not want the war to continue out of fe=
ar of an unlikely but possible Ukrainian collapse. And if the Europeans wan=
t only to occupy a neutral and peaceful Ukraine, rather than engage Russia =
in high-intensity warfare, there is a possibility that Europe =E2=80=93 and=
, more eagerly, the United States =E2=80=93 could agree to Russian demands =
for a demilitarized Ukraine.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But this would be =
dependent on the ability of troops in Poland to rapidly enter Ukraine in th=
e event of a renewed Russian invasion and to engage the Russians. Given the=
 last few years, Russia might not be willing to face Polish and American tr=
oops. The U.S. has 10,000 troops in Poland now, and Trump has promised more=
 troops to Poland in the future. Given the choice that Putin is putting on =
the table =E2=80=93 a continued war or a neutralized Ukraine =E2=80=93 it i=
s not certain that the choice won=E2=80=99t be continued warfare. At the sa=
me time, the evolution of Polish power has provided a possible alternative,=
 particularly given U.S. participation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In any case, the d=
ramatic expansion of Poland=E2=80=99s economic and military power has creat=
ed a new reality in which Poland, with U.S. backing, is the pivot and the c=
ounter to future Russian aggression, with or without other European aid. In=
deed, as Polish power continues to expand, based on a rapidly growing econo=
my, Poland can become =E2=80=93 and perhaps already is =E2=80=93 a signific=
ant deterrent to Russian action. In the not-too-distant future, its geograp=
hy and capability could make Poland emerge as a very significant power in t=
he region. It=E2=80=99s not quite there yet, but this is still a radical ch=
ange in the geopolitics of Europe.</p>
