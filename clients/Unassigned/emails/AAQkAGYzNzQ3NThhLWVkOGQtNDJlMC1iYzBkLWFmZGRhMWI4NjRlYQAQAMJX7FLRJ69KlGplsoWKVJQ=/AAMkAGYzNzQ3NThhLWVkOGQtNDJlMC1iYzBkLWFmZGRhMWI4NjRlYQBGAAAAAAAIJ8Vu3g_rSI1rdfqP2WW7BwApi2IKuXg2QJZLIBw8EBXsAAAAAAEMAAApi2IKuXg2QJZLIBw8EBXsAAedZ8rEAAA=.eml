GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: THE UNITED STATES, VENEZUELA, CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
First, I must apologize for an error in last week’s piece. The Florida Straits are not the only exit from the Gulf of Mexico. There is another one at the western end of Cuba through the Yucatan
Channel that runs south. It is a longer route to Europe, and it could be blocked as well, but a reader who served in the Merchant Marine caught the mistake and alerted me. Sorry about that.
_Question: When you write that "drug cartels grew dramatically stronger," who was selling/providing armaments to them? _
Response: The arms needed by cartels in Central and South America are not advanced technology. They are small arms, rifles and at times submachine guns. These can be readily acquired, given that the
mission of their users is to assert control over regions through intimidation and blocking not particularly motivated national militaries. Their greatest weapon is sharing the wealth to some degree
and small arms as required.
-------------------------
_Question: Some of this analysis is arguably not correct.  _
* _Any attempt to block the Straits of Florida would/could be met with overwhelming force easily supported by a short logistic chain._
You are certainly right in the long run. However, given today’s technology and the fact that vessels passing through are very expensive and owned by private companies or insured, I think that for a
while the embargo would be imposed by the owners of these. Given Russian submarines, drones on vessels dispersed in the Atlantic as well as mines inserted in both straits, the possibility of an
extended period of blockage is possible. And if Russia were attacked  directly with missiles, it could return the favor. I don’t think Russia would do it, but even the risk would affect the flow of
ships.
_2. The oceans are not the deterrence they once were prior to WW II. Modern weapons have shortened the distances with one very important exception, the logistic chain. You can't load supplies on an
Inter-Continental Missile or put boots on the ground._
Response: This has been the case since the development of long-range bombers in the 1950s and of missiles. During this time, the U.S. has been aggressive in a number of wars in the Eastern Hemisphere.
These wars were not fought only by aircraft and missiles but by ground forces.  There were some covert operations by the Soviets in Latin America but no major deployments, save in Cuba. My point is
that you can damage the U.S. with long range weapons, but you cannot invade the U.S. because those weapons you cite would devastate an invasion fleet, while the U.S. response to missile attack makes
that a bad idea for enemies. So given the ability (if not wisdom) of the U.S. engaging in land warfare in the Eastern Hemisphere and the lack of that sort of warfare in the western hemisphere, history
shows that it is the poor bloody infantry that is still the critical element of taking and holding territory. The reason the U.S. could fight Eastern Hemispheric wars was that it could deploy and
supply massive forces over the Atlantic and Pacific – not always wisely, but certainly proof that command of the oceans still matters in terms of projecting power.
-------------------------
_Question: Mr. Friedman’s attempts to put a patina of logic on Trump’s capricious actions are not very persuasive. Why does he persist?_
Response: I persist because I see the logic. When you dislike a president, his actions are incoherent and irrational. When you like a president, he is flexible. President Donald Trump’s fundamental
foreign policy is one of disengagement from the Eastern Hemisphere – a stark departure from post-World War II orthodoxy. He also wants to reconstruct the global trading system developed in the Cold
War. I agree that his public presentation of this is, shall we say, inefficient. I predicted that the president elected in this decade would pursue such a policy. In a way, it is the policy of the
left-wing during Vietnam: Do not wage war but negotiate. In that sense, Trump is a hippy.
-------------------------
_Question: “Guarantor.” Turkey is ready to serve as de facto guarantor for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Turkish Foreign Minister said. Will Turkey be the guarantor
that ensures Iran will not become the primary force in a Palestinian state? Will Turkey be the guarantor to prevent Hamas, Hezbollah or other groups from staging attacks against Israel from a
Palestinian state?_
Response: I can’t guarantee anything. The alternative third party would be U.S. troops. Europe isn’t going to do it, the U.S. don’t want Russia or China there.  And having no third party there
is not an option. Turkey is emerging as a major military force in the region and has nothing to gain from engaging Israel, given that in the past they have always avoided such engagement. So if not
Turkey, then who? As for Israel, a buffer is essential. Another victory like the one over Hamas would be too costly to contemplate. So if Turkey is willing, no one else is available.
-------------------------
_Question: But what about growing Chinese influence in the region?  On the surface doesn’t that seem to be a greater threat? _
Response: Chinese influence is primarily economic, and its military deployment is based on selling weapons to anyone with cash. Economic involvement may create influence in certain regions but China
has been very cautious in not taking aggressive military actions. Soviet power was dangerous because it was based on military power, not economic power. So in my view the foundation of a dangerous
country is military power. Influence based on economic activity is much less dangerous.
-------------------------
_Question: A good working hypothesis and the key would be finding a direct and substantive link between Russia and the drug cartels. Also why focus on Venezuela when Colombia is as involved, if not
more, and why not target Central America and Mexico through which all the drugs pass on route to the U.S.? Has the current administration zeroed in on Maduro to cause regime change in Venezuela?_
Response: Colombia has now been identified as Trump’s next target. As for Maduro, he has maintained good relations with Russia, and Trump wants regime change in Venezuela. Whether Maduro owns the
cartels or they own him is an open question. As for substantive links, the Soviets were the masters of covert operations, arming and to some extent training guerrillas and skillfully avoiding leaving
any substantive evidence. There were times the U.S. did the same in various places. There was no doubt that the Soviets were involved, but substantive evidence is something only amateurs make
available. I don’t know that the Russians are doing this, save for the fact that I have seen this game played before. Am I certain? Pretty much. Am I right? Maybe, maybe not. Covert is by definition
covert.

t the only exit from the Gulf of Mexico. There is another one at the wester=
n end of Cuba through the Yucatan Channel that runs south. It is a longer r=
oute to Europe, and it could be blocked as well, but a reader who served in=
 the Merchant Marine caught the mistake and alerted me. Sorry about that.</=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: When=
 you write that &quot;drug cartels grew dramatically stronger,&quot; who wa=
s selling/providing armaments to them? </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The arms=
 needed by cartels in Central and South America are not advanced technology=
. They are small arms, rifles and at times submachine guns. These can be re=
adily acquired, given that the mission of their users is to assert control =
over regions through intimidation and blocking not particularly motivated n=
ational militaries. Their greatest weapon is sharing the wealth to some deg=
ree and small arms as required.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Some=
 of this analysis is arguably not correct.&nbsp; </em></p>
<ol style=3D"margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:24px">
<li style=3D"line-height:24px"><em>Any attempt to block the Straits of Flor=
ida would/could be met with overwhelming force easily supported by a short =
logistic chain.</em></li>
</ol>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">You are certainly =
right in the long run. However, given today=E2=80=99s technology and the fa=
ct that vessels passing through are very expensive and owned by private com=
panies or insured, I think that for a while the embargo would be imposed by=
 the owners of these. Given Russian submarines, drones on vessels dispersed=
 in the Atlantic as well as mines inserted in both straits, the possibility=
 of an extended period of blockage is possible. And if Russia were attacked=
&nbsp; directly with missiles, it could return the favor. I don=E2=80=99t t=
hink Russia would do it, but even the risk would affect the flow of ships.<=
/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>2. The oceans =
are not the deterrence they once were prior to WW II. Modern weapons have s=
hortened the distances with one very important exception, the logistic chai=
n. You can't load supplies on an Inter-Continental Missile or put boots on =
the ground.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: This has=
 been the case since the development of long-range bombers in the 1950s and=
 of missiles. During this time, the U.S. has been aggressive in a number of=
 wars in the Eastern Hemisphere. These wars were not fought only by aircraf=
t and missiles but by ground forces.&nbsp; There were some covert operation=
s by the Soviets in Latin America but no major deployments, save in Cuba. M=
y point is that you can damage the U.S. with long range weapons, but you ca=
nnot invade the U.S. because those weapons you cite would devastate an inva=
sion fleet, while the U.S. response to missile attack makes that a bad idea=
 for enemies. So given the ability (if not wisdom) of the U.S. engaging in =
land warfare in the Eastern Hemisphere and the lack of that sort of warfare=
 in the western hemisphere, history shows that it is the poor bloody infant=
ry that is still the critical element of taking and holding territory. The =
reason the U.S. could fight Eastern Hemispheric wars was that it could depl=
oy and supply massive forces over the Atlantic and Pacific =E2=80=93 not al=
ways wisely, but certainly proof that command of the oceans still matters i=
n terms of projecting power.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Mr. =
Friedman=E2=80=99s attempts to put a patina of logic on Trump=E2=80=99s cap=
ricious actions are not very persuasive. Why does he persist?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I persis=
t because I see the logic. When you dislike a president, his actions are in=
coherent and irrational. When you like a president, he is flexible. Preside=
nt Donald Trump=E2=80=99s fundamental foreign policy is one of disengagemen=
t from the Eastern Hemisphere =E2=80=93 a stark departure from post-World W=
ar II orthodoxy. He also wants to reconstruct the global trading system dev=
eloped in the Cold War. I agree that his public presentation of this is, sh=
all we say, inefficient. I predicted that the president elected in this dec=
ade would pursue such a policy. In a way, it is the policy of the left-wing=
 during Vietnam: Do not wage war but negotiate. In that sense, Trump is a h=
ippy.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: =E2=
=80=9CGuarantor.=E2=80=9D Turkey is ready to serve as de facto guarantor fo=
r a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Turkish For=
eign Minister said. Will Turkey be the guarantor that ensures Iran will not=
 become the primary force in a Palestinian state? Will Turkey be the guaran=
tor to prevent Hamas, Hezbollah or other groups from staging attacks agains=
t Israel from a Palestinian state?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I can=E2=
=80=99t guarantee anything. The alternative third party would be U.S. troop=
s. Europe isn=E2=80=99t going to do it, the U.S. don=E2=80=99t want Russia =
or China there.&nbsp; And having no third party there is not an option. Tur=
key is emerging as a major military force in the region and has nothing to =
gain from engaging Israel, given that in the past they have always avoided =
such engagement. So if not Turkey, then who? As for Israel, a buffer is ess=
ential. Another victory like the one over Hamas would be too costly to cont=
emplate. So if Turkey is willing, no one else is available.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: But =
what about growing Chinese influence in the region?&nbsp; On the surface do=
esn=E2=80=99t that seem to be a greater threat? </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Chinese =
influence is primarily economic, and its military deployment is based on se=
lling weapons to anyone with cash. Economic involvement may create influenc=
e in certain regions but China has been very cautious in not taking aggress=
ive military actions. Soviet power was dangerous because it was based on mi=
litary power, not economic power. So in my view the foundation of a dangero=
us country is military power. Influence based on economic activity is much =
less dangerous.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: A go=
od working hypothesis and the key would be finding a direct and substantive=
 link between Russia and the drug cartels. Also why focus on Venezuela when=
 Colombia is as involved, if not more, and why not target Central America a=
nd Mexico through which all the drugs pass on route to the U.S.? Has the cu=
rrent administration zeroed in on Maduro to cause regime change in Venezuel=
a?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Colombia=
 has now been identified as Trump=E2=80=99s next target. As for Maduro, he =
has maintained good relations with Russia, and Trump wants regime change in=
 Venezuela. Whether Maduro owns the cartels or they own him is an open ques=
tion. As for substantive links, the Soviets were the masters of covert oper=
ations, arming and to some extent training guerrillas and skillfully avoidi=
ng leaving any substantive evidence. There were times the U.S. did the same=
 in various places. There was no doubt that the Soviets were involved, but =
substantive evidence is something only amateurs make available. I don=E2=80=
=99t know that the Russians are doing this, save for the fact that I have s=
een this game played before. Am I certain? Pretty much. Am I right? Maybe, =
maybe not. Covert is by definition covert.</p>
