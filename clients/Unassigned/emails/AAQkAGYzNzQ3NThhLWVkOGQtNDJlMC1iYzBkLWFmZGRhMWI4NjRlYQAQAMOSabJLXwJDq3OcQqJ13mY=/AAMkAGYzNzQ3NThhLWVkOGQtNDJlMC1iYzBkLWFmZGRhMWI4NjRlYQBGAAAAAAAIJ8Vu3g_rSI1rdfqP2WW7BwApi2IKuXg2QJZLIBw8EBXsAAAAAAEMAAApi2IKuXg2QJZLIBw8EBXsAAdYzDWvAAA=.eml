ON ASTROPOLITICS [3]
THERE’S MUCH WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT OUTER SPACE, BUT A THEORETICAL APPROACH SHOULD BEGIN WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT AIR AND NAVAL POWER.
BY: RIDVAN BARI URCOSTA
_EDITOR’S NOTE:__ July 16 marks the anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11, the American lunar landing mission that delivered the first earthlings to the moon. NASA has been comparatively quiet
lately, but other nations – and other private enterprises – continue to explore the undiscovered country. And it is in that spirit that we republish the following essay, originally printed in
2020, that explores how nations may think about the new space race. _
The first time space power was used for terrestrial warfare was the Gulf War, during which satellites contributed significantly to military operations in the Middle East. Since then, there has been
increasing demand for technology and war modeling for operations in space. Space, it seems, is slowly but surely becoming an essential component of warfare. It is therefore time and prudent to start
giving thought to and building a framework for understanding the parameters of space operations and conflicts. If geopolitics concerns all things earthly, then we can refer to how nations interact
among the stars — relations among colonies on planets, satellites and space stations, as well as economic cooperation, resource competition and the order around which this is built — as
“astropolitics.”
There’s still a lot we don’t know about the physics of outer space, of course. We don’t even know what kinds of technologies we will need to develop to operate there. Even so, a theoretical
approach to thinking about space power should start with things we do know: naval operations and air operations. Like the oceans, the expanse of outer space can be thought of as a global commons. This
means the two share some inherent characteristics such as long lines of communications and potential strategic chokepoints. Naval power has been used for centuries to secure national interests and
project power. And though there is some uncertainty over how relevant aviation and satellite technology will be when used well outside the bounds of our planet, aircraft are nonetheless an important
if auxiliary element of war.
With this in mind, we can begin to examine a set of geopolitical principles and imperatives that will determine the future of space power, using sea power as the main intellectual foundation.
COMMAND AND CONTROL
For as big as Earth probably seems to a naval officer on the open sea, it’s nothing compared to outer space. On Earth, there are peninsulas and islands and atolls, nearly all of which have been
charted, and many of which have existing infrastructure on them already. Once we start to explore the vast of outer space, we will be doing so comparatively blindly. This will make company-level
operations centers even more important there than they are here.
[Solar System] [4]

Command and control will also be more difficult to achieve. Bleddyn Bowen, an international relations scholar, posits a division between space command and space control. Bowen defines the command of
space as securing and/or denying the use of celestial lines of communication that objects and information travel in, from, toward and through. Space control, on the other hand, is more like
controlling specific areas of Earth, only in outer space. It is about hegemony — both military and political.
But just as there are chokepoints on Earth, so too will there be chokepoints in outer space [6]. There will, after all, be satellites, ships, colonies and everything else that needs to be supplied and
serviced and inhabited. Those chokepoints can be divided into four broad categories:
* Satellites and spaceships with long-term missions, and space stations with crews undertaking military functions near the Earth’s orbit.
 * Satellites and space stations in the first and most important celestial communicational line — from Earth to the moon.
 * Satellites and space stations between the second important celestial communicational line — from Earth to Mars.
 * The satellites, commercial ships and warships, and space stations and independent colonies that will eventually fill the solar system in the distant future. (Likely their missions will be to
become commercial, logistical or geopolitical hubs for the assumption of command and control responsibilities.)
Much of this will be impossible, of course, without the use of satellites, warships, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles that will be run by artificial intelligence, without human interference. Carl
Dolman Everett connects space warfare with informational warfare, but it is possible to develop this concept and imagine in the future a direct military interaction both on Earth and in space, between
the “software” of the great powers. For a space mission, it would be cheaper and safer to send drones with AI to specific and dangerous missions than to endanger a human crew. Both for politicians
and for business leaders, this will be an optimal solution. And this is to say nothing about the legal framework of space travel, which doesn’t exist yet. As Jonathan Sydney Koch writes, currently
there is a lack of legal framework for the use of space resources found on asteroids and other celestial bodies. In general, their missions, strategically speaking, will be the same as those of
warships at sea.
FROM SOVEREIGNTY AT SEA TO SOVEREIGNTY IN SPACE
The oceans required autonomy and independence from ships; given the time and distance between colonies and the metropole, space will require it even more so. The appearance on the global political map
of different independent states is determined by geopolitical factors. The metropolis was not able to control the complex social and political entities that colonies became from a remote distance.
While they were primitive settlements it was relatively easy, but when the old management started to change, it became impossible.
[Communication Delays in Space] [7]
_(click to enlarge)_ [8]
In case of war or emergency, the crew or settlers in space must have full independence in order to adopt the most adequate decision to their reality; given the serious time delays in communication
with Earth, anything less would be impossible for a state that wants to achieve great-power status.

=E2=80=99s note:</em></strong><em> July 16 marks the anniversary of the lau=
nch of Apollo 11, the American lunar landing mission that delivered the fir=
st earthlings to the moon. NASA has been comparatively quiet lately, but ot=
her nations =E2=80=93 and other private enterprises =E2=80=93 continue to e=
xplore the undiscovered country. And it is in that spirit that we republish=
 the following essay, originally printed in 2020, that explores how nations=
 may think about the new space race. </em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The first time spa=
ce power was used for terrestrial warfare was the Gulf War, during which sa=
tellites contributed significantly to military operations in the Middle Eas=
t. Since then, there has been increasing demand for technology and war mode=
ling for operations in space. Space, it seems, is slowly but surely becomin=
g an essential component of warfare. It is therefore time and prudent to st=
art giving thought to and building a framework for understanding the parame=
ters of space operations and conflicts. If geopolitics concerns all things =
earthly, then we can refer to how nations interact among the stars =E2=80=
=94 relations among colonies on planets, satellites and space stations, as =
well as economic cooperation, resource competition and the order around whi=
ch this is built =E2=80=94 as =E2=80=9Castropolitics.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There=E2=80=99s st=
ill a lot we don=E2=80=99t know about the physics of outer space, of course=
. We don=E2=80=99t even know what kinds of technologies we will need to dev=
elop to operate there. Even so, a theoretical approach to thinking about sp=
ace power should start with things we do know: naval operations and air ope=
rations. Like the oceans, the expanse of outer space can be thought of as a=
 global commons. This means the two share some inherent characteristics suc=
h as long lines of communications and potential strategic chokepoints. Nava=
l power has been used for centuries to secure national interests and projec=
t power. And though there is some uncertainty over how relevant aviation an=
d satellite technology will be when used well outside the bounds of our pla=
net, aircraft are nonetheless an important if auxiliary element of war.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With this in mind,=
 we can begin to examine a set of geopolitical principles and imperatives t=
hat will determine the future of space power, using sea power as the main i=
ntellectual foundation.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Command an=
d Control</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For as big as Eart=
h probably seems to a naval officer on the open sea, it=E2=80=99s nothing c=
ompared to outer space. On Earth, there are peninsulas and islands and atol=
ls, nearly all of which have been charted, and many of which have existing =
infrastructure on them already. Once we start to explore the vast of outer =
space, we will be doing so comparatively blindly. This will make company-le=
vel operations centers even more important there than they are here.</p>

<p style=3D"text-align: left;line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">C=
ommand and control will also be more difficult to achieve. Bleddyn Bowen, a=
n international relations scholar, posits a division between space command =
and space control. Bowen defines the command of space as securing and/or de=
nying the use of celestial lines of communication that objects and informat=
ion travel in, from, toward and through. Space control, on the other hand, =
is more like controlling specific areas of Earth, only in outer space. It i=
s about hegemony =E2=80=94 both military and political.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But just as there =
are chokepoints on Earth, so too will there be <a href=3D"https://geopoliti=

=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">chokepoints in oute=
r space</a>. There will, after all, be satellites, ships, colonies and ever=
ything else that needs to be supplied and serviced and inhabited. Those cho=
kepoints can be divided into four broad categories:</p>
<ul style=3D"margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:24px">
<li style=3D"line-height:24px">Satellites and spaceships with long-term mis=
sions, and space stations with crews undertaking military functions near th=
e Earth=E2=80=99s orbit.</li>
<li style=3D"line-height:24px">Satellites and space stations in the first a=
nd most important celestial communicational line =E2=80=94 from Earth to th=
e moon.</li>
<li style=3D"line-height:24px">Satellites and space stations between the se=
cond important celestial communicational line =E2=80=94 from Earth to Mars.=
</li>
<li style=3D"line-height:24px">The satellites, commercial ships and warship=
s, and space stations and independent colonies that will eventually fill th=
e solar system in the distant future. (Likely their missions will be to bec=
ome commercial, logistical or geopolitical hubs for the assumption of comma=
nd and control responsibilities.)</li>
</ul>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Much of this will =
be impossible, of course, without the use of satellites, warships, drones a=
nd unmanned aerial vehicles that will be run by artificial intelligence, wi=
thout human interference. Carl Dolman Everett connects space warfare with i=
nformational warfare, but it is possible to develop this concept and imagin=
e in the future a direct military interaction both on Earth and in space, b=
etween the =E2=80=9Csoftware=E2=80=9D of the great powers. For a space miss=
ion, it would be cheaper and safer to send drones with AI to specific and d=
angerous missions than to endanger a human crew. Both for politicians and f=
or business leaders, this will be an optimal solution. And this is to say n=
othing about the legal framework of space travel, which doesn=E2=80=99t exi=
st yet. As Jonathan Sydney Koch writes, currently there is a lack of legal =
framework for the use of space resources found on asteroids and other celes=
tial bodies. In general, their missions, strategically speaking, will be th=
e same as those of warships at sea.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>From Sover=
eignty at Sea to Sovereignty in Space</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The oceans require=
d autonomy and independence from ships; given the time and distance between=
 colonies and the metropole, space will require it even more so. The appear=
ance on the global political map of different independent states is determi=
ned by geopolitical factors. The metropolis was not able to control the com=
plex social and political entities that colonies became from a remote dista=
nce. While they were primitive settlements it was relatively easy, but when=
 the old management started to change, it became impossible.</p>
