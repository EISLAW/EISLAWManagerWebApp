 practice for building great products. AI products are just built different=

If you=E2=80=99re a product manager or builder shipping AI features or prod=
ucts, you=E2=80=99ve probably felt this:=20
Your company is under pressure to launch something with AI. A promising ide=
a takes shape. The team nails the demo, the early reviews look good, and st=
akeholders are excited. You push hard to ship it to production.
Then things start to break. You=E2=80=99re deep in the weeds, trying to fig=
ure out what went wrong. But the issues are tangled and hard to trace, and =
nothing points to a single fix. Suddenly your entire product approach feels=
 shaky.
We=E2=80=99ve seen this play out again and again. Over the past few years, =
we=E2=80=99ve helped over 50 companies design, ship, and scale AI-powered a=
utonomous systems with thousands of customers. Across all of these experien=
ces, we=E2=80=99ve seen a common pitfall: people overlook the fact that AI =
systems fundamentally break the assumptions of traditional software product=
s.
You can=E2=80=99t build AI products like other products, for two reasons:
AI products are inherently non-deterministic
Every AI product must negotiate a tradeoff between agency and control
When companies don=E2=80=99t recognize these differences, their AI products=
 face ripple effects like unexpected failures and poor decision-making. We=
=E2=80=99ve seen so many teams experience the painful shift from an impress=
ive demo to a system that can=E2=80=99t scale or sustain. And along the way=
, user trust in the product quietly erodes.
After seeing this pattern play out many times, we developed a new framework=
 for the AI product development lifecycle, based on what we=E2=80=99ve seen=
 in successful deployments. It=E2=80=99s designed to recognize the uniquene=
ss of AI systems and help you build more intentional, stable, and trustwort=
hy products. By the end of this post, you should be able to map your own pr=
oduct to this framework and have a better sense of how to start, where to f=
ocus, and how to scale safely.
Let=E2=80=99s walk through the ways that building AI products is different =
from traditional software.
1. AI products are inherently non-deterministic
Traditional software behaves more or less predictably. Users interact in kn=
own ways: clicking buttons, submitting forms, triggering API calls. You wri=
te logic that maps those inputs to outcomes. If something breaks, it=E2=80=
=99s usually a code issue, and you can trace it back.
AI systems behave differently. They introduce non-determinism on both ends:=
 in other words, there=E2=80=99s unpredictability in how users engage and h=
ow the system responds.
First, the user interaction surface is far less deterministic. Instead of s=
tructured triggers like button clicks, users interact through open-ended pr=
ompts, voice commands, or other natural inputs. These are harder to validat=
e, easier to misinterpret, and vary widely in how users express intent.
Second, the system=E2=80=99s behavior is inherently non-deterministic. AI m=
odels are trained to generate plausible responses based on patterns, not to=
 follow fixed rules. The same request can produce different results dependi=
ng on phrasing, context, or even a different model.
This fundamentally changes how you build and ship. You=E2=80=99re no longer=
 designing for a predictable user flow. You=E2=80=99re designing for likely=
 behavior=E2=80=94both from the user and the product=E2=80=94not guaranteed=
 behavior. Your development process needs to account for that uncertainty f=
rom the start, continuously calibrating between what you expect and what sh=
ows up in the real world.
2. Every AI product negotiates a tradeoff between agency and control
There=E2=80=99s another layer that makes AI systems different, and it=E2=80=
=99s one we rarely had to think about before with traditional software prod=
ucts: agency.
Agency, in this context, is the AI system=E2=80=99s ability to take actions=
, make decisions, or carry out tasks on behalf of the user (which is where =
the term =E2=80=9CAI agent=E2=80=9D comes from). Think:
Booking a flight
Executing code
Handling a support ticket from start to finish
Unlike traditional tools, AI systems are built to act with varying levels o=
f autonomy. But here=E2=80=99s the part people often overlook:
Every time you give an AI system more agency, you give up some control.
So there=E2=80=99s always an agency-control tradeoff at play. And that trad=
eoff matters (a lot!). If your system suggests a response, you can still ov=
erride it. If it sends the response automatically, you=E2=80=99d better be =
sure it=E2=80=99s right.
The mistake most teams make is jumping to full agency before they=E2=80=99v=
e tested what happens when the system gets it wrong. If you haven=E2=80=99t=
 tested how the system behaves under high control, you=E2=80=99re not ready=
 to give it high agency. And if you hand over too much agency without the s=
ystem earning it first, you may lose visibility into the system, and the tr=
ust of your users.
What=E2=80=99s more, you=E2=80=99re stuck debugging a large, complicated sy=
stem that has taken actions you can=E2=80=99t trace, for reasons you=E2=80=
=99ve lost insight into, so you don=E2=80=99t even know what to change.
Which brings us to the core framework we=E2=80=99ve developed to help teams=
 navigate these distinctions.
We call it CC/CD: Continuous Calibration/Continuous Development.
The name is a reference to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI=
/CD), but, unlike its namesake, it=E2=80=99s meant for systems where behavi=
or is non-deterministic and agency needs to be earned.
The Continuous Calibration/Continuous Development framework
Just like in traditional software, AI products move through phases toward a=
n end goal. But building AI requires you to account for two things we menti=
oned earlier: non-determinism and the agency-control tradeoff.
The CC/CD framework is designed to work around these two realities by:
Reducing a system=E2=80=99s non-determinism through design or by monitoring=
 it closely
Ensuring that agency is earned over time, not granted all at once, because =
every new capability shifts control further away from humans
In our framework, product builders work in a continuous loop of development=
 (CD) and calibration (CC). During development, you scope the problem, desi=
gn the architecture, and set up evaluations to keep non-determinism in chec=
k. You start with features that are low-agency and high-control, then gradu=
ally move up as the system proves it can handle more.
Then you deploy, not as a finish line but as a transition into the next pha=
se. Once you=E2=80=99ve deployed, you enter the calibration loop, where you=
 observe real behavior, figure out what broke, and make targeted improvemen=
ts.
With every cycle, the system earns a bit more agency. Over time, this loop =
turns into a flywheel, tightening feedback, building trust, and making the =
product stronger with each version.
Let=E2=80=99s go deeper into each step of the CC/CD loop, what it looks lik=
e, why it matters, and how to do it well. The first three steps make up the=
 Continuous Development side of the loop: scoping the capability, setting u=
p the application, and designing evals.
CD 1. Scope capability and curate data
Let=E2=80=99s say you have a big product idea and you=E2=80=99ve already do=
ne your research. It=E2=80=99s clear that AI is the right approach. In trad=
itional software development, you=E2=80=99d typically plan for v1, v2, v3 o=
f the new product based on feature depth or user needs. With AI systems, th=
e versioning still applies, but the lens shifts.
Here, each version is defined by how much agency the system has and how muc=
h control you=E2=80=99re willing to give up. So instead of thinking in term=
s of feature sets, you scope capabilities. Start by identifying a set of fe=
atures that are high control and low agency (version 1 in the image above).=
 These should be small, testable, and easy to observe. From there, think ab=
out how those capabilities can evolve over time by gradually increasing age=
ncy, one version at a time. The goal is to break down a lofty end state int=
o early behaviors that you can evaluate, iterate on, and build upward from.
For instance, if your end goal is to automate customer support in your comp=
any, a high-control way to start would be to scope v1 (version 1) as simply=
 routing tickets to the right department, then move to v2 where the system =
suggests possible resolutions, and only in v3 allow it to auto-resolve with=
 human fallback.
Remember, this is just one approach. What it looks like in practice will de=
pend on your product, but the process tends to be consistent: Start with si=
mple decisions that are easy to verify and easy for humans to override. The=
n, as you progress through the CC/CD loop, gradually layer in more autonomy=
 with each version.
How long you stay in each version depends entirely on how much behavioral s=
ignal you=E2=80=99re seeing. You=E2=80=99re optimizing for understanding ho=
w your AI behaves under real-world noise and variation.
Here are a couple more examples:
Marketing assistant
v1: Draft email, ad, or social copy from prompts
v2: Build multi-step campaigns and run them
v3: Launch, A/B test, and auto-optimize campaigns across channels
Coding assistant
v1: Suggest inline completions and boilerplate snippets
v2: Generate larger blocks (like tests or refactors) for human review
v3: Apply scoped changes and open pull requests (PRs) autonomously
If you=E2=80=99ve followed how tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor evolved,=
 this is exactly the playbook they used. Most users only see the current ve=
rsion, but the underlying system climbed that ladder gradually. First compl=
etions, then blocks, then PRs, with each step earned through usage, feedbac=
k, and iteration.
Now, because user behavior is non-deterministic, you=E2=80=99ll need to bui=
ld a reference for what expected behavior looks like and how your AI system=
 should respond. That=E2=80=99s where data comes in. Data helps break the c=
old start and gives you something concrete to evaluate against. We call thi=
s the reference dataset.
In the customer support automation example, for the routing version (v1), y=
our reference dataset might include:
The user query
The department it should be routed to
Metadata used to make the decision, such as product type, user tier, or cha=
nnel
You can pull this from past logs if available, or generate examples based o=
n how your product is expected to work. This dataset helps you evaluate sys=
tem performance and also tells you what context your assistant needs in ord=
er to perform reliably. Since most products start cold, aim to gather at le=
ast 20 to 100 examples up front.
We=E2=80=99ll continue using the customer support example to walk through t=
he next steps in the CC/CD loop. Imagine you=E2=80=99re building toward a f=
ully autonomous support system for a company. Below are the versions we=E2=
=80=99ll reference, along with their corresponding agency and control level=
s. We=E2=80=99ll refer to v1, v2, and v3 throughout the rest of the post.
CD 2. Set up application
Most people skip step 1 and jump into the setup phase too early, getting lo=
st in implementation choices and overthinking which components are needed. =
But if you=E2=80=99ve scoped your capability properly in step 1, looked at =
enough examples, and curated a solid reference dataset, setting up the appl=
ication should be fairly straightforward. You already know what the system =
needs to do, have a sense of what users are likely to throw at it, and unde=
rstand what a good response looks like. Now it=E2=80=99s just about wiring =
together the simplest version that gives you a useful signal.
There=E2=80=99s a famous saying in software, for a reason: =E2=80=9CPrematu=
re optimization is the root of all evil. [ https://substack.com/redirect/a4=
059e27-1fef-4a15-b075-e0244c6b0651?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9=
hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=9D It applies here too. Don=E2=80=99t o=
verengineer. Don=E2=80=99t over-optimize. Not at this stage. Just don=E2=80=
=99t. Build only what=E2=80=99s needed for your current version. Make the s=
ystem measurable and iterable by setting up logs to capture what the system=
 sees from the user, what it returns, and how people interact with it. This=
 will form the basis of your live interaction dataset and help you improve =
the system over time. We won=E2=80=99t go deep into implementation here, bu=
t if you=E2=80=99re exposing this to end users, make sure the basics like g=
uardrails and compliance are in place.
One more important point: When setting up the application, make sure contro=
l can be handed back to humans seamlessly when needed. We=E2=80=99ll refer =
to these as control handoffs. For example, in the customer support v1, if a=
 ticket is misrouted, the receiving agent (the point of contact for that de=
partment) should be able to reroute it easily. Since that correction is log=
ged, it not only helps improve the system over time but also preserves the =
user experience. Thinking about control handoffs from the start is key to b=
uilding trust and keeping things recoverable.
CD 3. Design evals
This is the part that usually takes a bit of thought. Before shipping anyth=
ing, you need to define how you=E2=80=99ll measure whether the system is do=
ing what you expect and whether it=E2=80=99s ready for the next step. You d=
o this using evaluation metrics (evals, for short).
So, what are evals?...

gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Traditional software behav=
es more or less predictably. Users interact in known ways: clicking buttons=
, submitting forms, triggering API calls. You write logic that maps those i=
nputs to outcomes. If something breaks, it=E2=80=99s usually a code issue, =
and you can trace it back.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

ords, there=E2=80=99s unpredictability in how users engage and how the syst=
em responds.</strong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">First, the user interaction surface i=
s far less deterministic. Instead of structured triggers like button clicks=
, users interact through open-ended prompts, voice commands, or other natur=
al inputs. These are harder to validate, easier to misinterpret, and vary w=
idely in how users express intent.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Second, the system=E2=80=

erate plausible responses based on patterns, not to follow fixed rules. The=
 same request can produce different results depending on phrasing, context,=
 or even a different model.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

play. And that tradeoff matters (a lot!). If your system suggests a respons=

 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The mi=
stake most teams make is jumping to full agency before they=E2=80=99ve test=
ed what happens when the system gets it wrong. If you haven=E2=80=99t teste=
d how the system behaves under high control, you=E2=80=99re not ready to gi=

re, each version is defined by how much agency the system has and how much =
control you=E2=80=99re willing to give up. So instead of thinking in terms =
of feature sets, you scope capabilities. Start by identifying a set of feat=
ures that are </span><strong>high control</strong><span> and </span><strong=
>low agency</strong><span> (version 1 in the image above). These should be =
small, testable, and easy to observe. From there, think about how those cap=
abilities can evolve over time by gradually increasing agency, one version =
at a time. The goal is to break down a lofty end state into early behaviors=
 that you can evaluate, iterate on, and build upward from.</span></p><p sty=

ur company, a high-control way to start would be to scope v1 (version 1) as=
 simply routing tickets to the right department, then move to v2 where the =
