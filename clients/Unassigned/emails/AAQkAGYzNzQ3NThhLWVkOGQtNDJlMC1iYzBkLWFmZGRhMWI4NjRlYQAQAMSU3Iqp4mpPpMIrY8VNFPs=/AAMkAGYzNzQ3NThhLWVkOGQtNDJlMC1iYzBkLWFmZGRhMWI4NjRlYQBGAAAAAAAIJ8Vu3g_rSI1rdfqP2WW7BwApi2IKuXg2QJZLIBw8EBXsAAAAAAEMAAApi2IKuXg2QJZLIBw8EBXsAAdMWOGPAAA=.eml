Hot off the presses! Had to get this one out today because the ruling is su=
ch a big deal.
Hope you enjoy, and back to our regular programming soon=E2=80=A6
Subscribers get all these pieces!
I've been following AI copyright cases closely, and Judge William Alsup jus=
t handed down what I believe will be one of THE landmark AI decisions we'll=
 see this decade. The federal court's split ruling in Bartz v. Anthropic do=
es something remarkable: it validates AI training as fair use while simulta=
neously condemning the piracy that often enables it. This isn't just a win =
or loss for Anthropic=E2=80=94it's a blueprint for how courts will likely a=
pproach the dozens of AI copyright cases working their way through the syst=
em.
The Solomon's Choice of AI Copyright
I find Alsup's decision fascinating because it splits the baby with surgica=
l precision. Yes, training Claude on millions of books constitutes fair use=
=2E No, downloading those same books fr=
om pirate sites doesn't get a free pas=
s. The distinction matters because it fundamentally reshapes how AI compani=
es must think about data acquisition.
The judge's reasoning on fair use particularly struck me. He describes AI t=
raining as "quintessentially transformative," comparing it to how human wri=
ters learn from reading. "Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts,=
" Alsup writes. "To make anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each=
 time they read it, each time they recall it from memory, each time they la=
ter draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable."
This analogy=E2=80=94AI as reader learning to write=E2=80=94provides the co=
nceptual foundation that I think AI companies have been desperately seeking=
=2E It's not about copying; it's about=20=
learning patterns, understanding langu=
age, and creating something fundamentally new.
The Million-Dollar Pivot
Here's where I think Anthropic's story gets really interesting. After build=
ing their initial models on pirated content from Books3, Library Genesis, a=
nd other dubious sources, the company made a dramatic shift in 2024. They h=
ired Tom Turvey, the former head of Google's book-scanning project, with a =
mandate to obtain "all the books in the world" through legitimate means.
Anthropic then spent millions of dollars purchasing physical books=E2=80=94=
many second-hand=E2=80=94which they proceeded to slice from their bindings =
and scan into digital format. The physical books were destroyed in the proc=
ess, but the digital copies were ruled as legitimate fair use. This expensi=
ve pivot from piracy to purchase reveals something I've been saying for a w=
hile: AI companies can afford to do this right. They're choosing not to.
The court explicitly noted this financial capability, observing that Anthro=
pic's later purchases of books they'd previously pirated "will not absolve =
it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory dam=
ages." Translation: we see you had the money all along.
What This Means for Authors
I think this ruling offers a glimmer of hope for authors who've watched AI =
companies feast on their work without compensation. While the fair use ruli=
ng means authors can't stop AI training entirely, the court's condemnation =
of piracy and validation of legitimate book purchases creates real market i=
ncentives.
Consider what Anthropic's spending reveals: they paid millions for books, o=
ften buying used copies at market rates. This money flows back into the boo=
k ecosystem=E2=80=94to retailers, distributors, and ultimately supporting t=
he market for authors' works. If every AI company followed this model inste=
ad of scraping pirate sites, we'd see a substantial new revenue stream for =
the publishing industry.
Moreover, the ruling's emphasis on transformation rather than reproduction =
protects authors' core market. The court stressed that it matters whether A=
I systems "directly compete with the originals." Since Claude doesn't spit =
out verbatim passages from novels, the technology complements rather than r=
eplaces human authorship.
I see this as establishing a sustainable equilibrium: AI companies must pay=
 for access to training materials, supporting the creative economy, while a=
uthors benefit from AI tools that help readers discover and engage with hum=
an-written works.
The Domino Effect
This ruling's impact extends far beyond Anthropic's legal troubles. I'm wat=
ching several major cases that will likely cite this precedent:
The OpenAI Cases: Multiple lawsuits against OpenAI, including from the Auth=
ors Guild and various publishers, hinge on similar fair use arguments. Alsu=
p's framework=E2=80=94distinguishing between training use and acquisition m=
ethods=E2=80=94gives OpenAI a potential path to victory, assuming they can =
demonstrate legitimate data sourcing.
Kadrey v. Meta: The lawsuit against Meta for training LLaMA on Books3 (the =
same dataset Anthropic used) now faces an interesting precedent. Meta might=
 win on fair use for training but could still face liability if they retain=
ed pirated materials in a permanent library.
The Stability AI Litigation: Visual AI companies face additional complexiti=
es, but I think Alsup's "transformative use" reasoning could extend to imag=
e generation models that learn artistic styles without reproducing specific=
 works.
The New Compliance Playbook
From my reading of Alsup's ruling, he's effectively created a compliance ro=
admap for AI companies:
Training on copyrighted works? Probably fine, as long as your model doesn't=
 reproduce those works verbatim.
Building a permanent library of pirated content? Definitely not fine, even =
if you only use it for training.
Want to avoid liability? Buy the books. Or license them. Or use legitimatel=
y free sources. But stop pretending piracy is a necessary evil.
Already have pirated content? Delete it after training. The court's distinc=
tion between temporary training copies and permanent library storage offers=
 a potential safe harbor.
The Billion-Dollar Question
With damages still to be determined, I calculate Anthropic faces potential =
liability in the billions. Statutory damages for willful infringement can r=
each $150,000 per work, and we're talking about millions of books. This cre=
ates a powerful deterrent effect: train responsibly or face existential fin=
ancial risk.
The message I'm taking from this ruling is clear: the transformative nature=
 of your technology doesn't give you a free pass to transform other people'=
s property into your training data through illegal means. Fair use protects=
 the learning, not the theft.
As more courts adopt Alsup's framework, I expect we'll see a fundamental sh=
ift in how AI companies approach data acquisition. The days of "download fi=
rst, ask permission never" are ending. The future belongs to companies will=
ing to do what Anthropic eventually did: open their wallets and do things t=
he right way.
Even if it means destroying a few million books in the process=E2=80=94at l=
east authors got paid for them.
The Bigger Picture
I should note that while Alsup's ruling gives us crucial clarity, we're sti=
ll in the early innings of this game. This is just one federal district cou=
rt's take, and I've learned to be cautious about declaring victory based on=
 a single decision. We've got dozens of similar cases working through diffe=
rent courts, each with their own judges who might see things differently.
I'm particularly aware that the Northern District of California doesn't spe=
ak for the entire country. We're already seeing circuit splits on related A=
I issues=E2=80=94the Ninth Circuit requires "actual knowledge" for contribu=
tory infringement while the Second Circuit only needs "reason to know." Tha=
t's a big difference when we're talking about platforms hosting AI tools.
What's more, this ruling really only addresses text-based AI training. I'm =
left wondering how courts will handle visual AI systems, code generation, o=
r the myriad other AI applications we're seeing. Fair use is notoriously fa=
ct-specific, and what works for Claude might not work for DALL-E or Copilot=
=2E
I expect we'll see Anthropic appeal to the Ninth Circuit, which could modif=
y or even reverse parts of Alsup's reasoning. And honestly? I think we'll e=
ventually need either the Supreme Court to step in and create nationwide cl=
arity, or Congress to pass actual AI legislation. Neither seems likely in t=
he near term, which means we're in for years of case-by-case battles as the=
 law slowly catches up to the technology.
Still, Alsup's decision represents real progress. It's the first federal co=
urt to tackle these questions head-on, and that matters=E2=80=94even if it'=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">I find Alsup's decision fascinating because it splits the baby with s=
urgical precision. Yes, training Claude on millions of books constitutes fa=
ir use. No, downloading those same books from pirate sites doesn't get a fr=
ee pass. The distinction matters because it fundamentally reshapes how AI c=
ompanies must think about data acquisition.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The judge's rea=
soning on fair use particularly struck me. He describes AI training as &quo=
t;quintessentially transformative,&quot; comparing it to how human writers =
learn from reading. &quot;Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts,=
&quot; Alsup writes. &quot;To make anyone pay specifically for the use of a=
 book each time they read it, each time they recall it from memory, each ti=
me they later draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unt=
hinkable.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=

0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Here's where I t=
hink Anthropic's story gets really interesting. After building their initia=
l models on pirated content from Books3, Library Genesis, and other dubious=
 sources, the company made a dramatic shift in 2024. They hired Tom Turvey,=
 the former head of Google's book-scanning project, with a mandate to obtai=
n &quot;all the books in the world&quot; through legitimate means.</p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">Anthropic then spent millions of dollars purchasing physical books=
=E2=80=94many second-hand=E2=80=94which they proceeded to slice from their =
bindings and scan into digital format. The physical books were destroyed in=
 the process, but the digital copies were ruled as legitimate fair use. Thi=
s expensive pivot from piracy to purchase reveals something I've been sayin=
g for a while: AI companies can afford to do this right. They're choosing n=
ot to.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">The court explicitly noted this financial capability=
, observing that Anthropic's later purchases of books they'd previously pir=
ated &quot;will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect=
 the extent of statutory damages.&quot; Translation: we see you had the mon=
ey all along.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relati=

in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I t=
hink this ruling offers a glimmer of hope for authors who've watched AI com=
panies feast on their work without compensation. While the fair use ruling =
means authors can't stop AI training entirely, the court's condemnation of =
piracy and validation of legitimate book purchases creates real market ince=
ntives.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">Consider what Anthropic's spending reveals: they pa=
id millions for books, often buying used copies at market rates. This money=
 flows back into the book ecosystem=E2=80=94to retailers, distributors, and=
 ultimately supporting the market for authors' works. If every AI company f=
ollowed this model instead of scraping pirate sites, we'd see a substantial=
 new revenue stream for the publishing industry.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Moreover, =
the ruling's emphasis on transformation rather than reproduction protects a=
uthors' core market. The court stressed that it matters whether AI systems =
&quot;directly compete with the originals.&quot; Since Claude doesn't spit =
out verbatim passages from novels, the technology complements rather than r=
eplaces human authorship.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I see this as establishing a sust=
ainable equilibrium: AI companies must pay for access to training materials=
, supporting the creative economy, while authors benefit from AI tools that=
 help readers discover and engage with human-written works.</p><h2 class=3D=

26px;font-size: 16px;">With damages still to be determined, I calculate Ant=
hropic faces potential liability in the billions. Statutory damages for wil=
lful infringement can reach $150,000 per work, and we're talking about mill=
ions of books. This creates a powerful deterrent effect: train responsibly =
or face existential financial risk.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

from this ruling is clear: the transformative nature of your technology doe=
sn't give you a free pass to transform other people's property into your tr=
aining data through illegal means. Fair use protects the learning, not the =
theft.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =

 future belongs to companies willing to do what Anthropic eventually did: o=

ld note that while Alsup's ruling gives us crucial clarity, we're still in =
the early innings of this game. This is just one federal district court's t=
ake, and I've learned to be cautious about declaring victory based on a sin=
gle decision. We've got dozens of similar cases working through different c=
ourts, each with their own judges who might see things differently.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">I'm particularly aware that the Northern District of California do=
esn't speak for the entire country. We're already seeing circuit splits on =
related AI issues=E2=80=94the Ninth Circuit requires &quot;actual knowledge=
&quot; for contributory infringement while the Second Circuit only needs &q=

platforms hosting AI tools.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

 only addresses text-based AI training. I'm left wondering how courts will =
handle visual AI systems, code generation, or the myriad other AI applicati=

 Claude might not work for DALL-E or Copilot.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

erse parts of Alsup's reasoning. And honestly? I think we'll eventually nee=
d either the Supreme Court to step in and create nationwide clarity, or Con=
gress to pass actual AI legislation. Neither seems likely in the near term,=
 which means we're in for years of case-by-case battles as the law slowly c=
