DAILY MEMO: CHINESE WEAPONS, GREEK MIGRATION POLICY [3]
BEIJING PUT ITS NATIONAL ARSENAL ON FULL DISPLAY.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
CHINA'S MILITARY MIGHT. China showcased [4] hypersonic missiles, anti-ship missiles and unmanned helicopters at a massive military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. At
the event, Beijing also unveiled reconnaissance drones, strike drones, wingman drones and several other types of advanced military hardware. In a speech [5], President Xi Jinping hailed his
country’s military might as “unstoppable” and called on all nations “to treat each other as equals and support one another to safeguard common security, eliminate the root cause of war and
prevent historical tragedies from recurring.” Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined Xi at the event, the first meeting involving the leaders of all three
countries in more than six decades. Kim was accompanied [6] by his daughter, fueling speculation that she is being groomed as his heir. Kim and Putin held a separate meeting [7] on the sidelines of
the event, during which Putin praised the role of North Korean soldiers in recapturing Russia’s Kursk region from Ukrainian forces.
REFUGEE RESTRICTIONS. Greece’s parliament on Wednesday approved [8] a sweeping migration law. Under the legislation, migrants from EU-designated “safe countries” whose asylum claims are rejected
must either leave voluntarily or face up to 24 months in detention and fines of up to 10,000 euros ($11,600). The move builds on the conservative government’s push [9] to expedite returns amid
rising arrivals from Libya, especially to the islands of Crete and Gavdos. In July, Greece suspended asylum applications for migrants arriving by sea from Africa for three months.
ANOTHER CHALLENGE. Opposition parties in Bulgaria plan to file [10] a no-confidence motion against the government amid nationwide protests demanding sweeping reforms. The initiative is led by a pro-EU
coalition and backed by nationalist and pro-Russian groups, forming an unusual alliance of ideologically opposed forces. It would be the fifth such vote since the current government took office in
January.
RUSSIAN TECH. The pace of data center construction in Russia is slowing down [11], despite growing global investment in the field. In the first half of this year, the commissioning of new facilities
declined by more than half compared with the same period last year amid a lack of corporate financing, stagnating incomes, increasing costs, energy and labor shortages, and a limited number of large
players in the market. Many companies are also under pressure from economic sanctions and increased data security requirements.
SUPPORT FOR KYIV. British Defense Secretary John Healy arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday for talks with Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal. According to Shmyhal [12], they plan to discuss joint
defense projects and an upcoming meeting of the so-called Ramstein group of Ukraine supporters, to be held in London next week.
POLAND'S RISE. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski lobbied for Poland’s inclusion in the G20 during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Florida, the minister said [13] on
Tuesday. Earlier the same day, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that Poland had entered the “exclusive club” of countries with economies worth more than $1 trillion. Tusk said that Poland’s
gross domestic product increased 3.4 percent in the second quarter and that it topped all advanced economies in growth of real disposable income per capita since late 2023.
EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS. The European Union is deepening trade ties [14] with Latin America and Asia amid continued global trade disruptions. The College of Commissioners on Wednesday formally adopted
the EU’s initial trade agreements with the Mercosur bloc – which is set to create the world’s largest free trade zone, covering 700 million people – and Mexico. The European Commission is also
pushing to finalize trade pacts [15] with India and Indonesia by the end of this year and expand links with Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand.
TRADE DIVERSIFICATION. South Korea plans to reopen its strategic review on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the country’s Industry Ministry said
[16]. Seoul had wanted to join the Japan-led trade bloc in 2022 but failed to submit an official application due to opposition from the agriculture and fisheries sectors and its strained ties with
Tokyo. The ministry also unveiled a plan to provide up to 570 billion won ($410 million) in emergency financial aid this year to help South Korean companies cope with the United States’ imposition
of 50 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.
YEAR OF DISRUPTION. Relatedly, a new report [17] by the U.N. Trade and Development organization highlights the destabilizing effects of growing uncertainty in global trade policies. The overall result
of the changes this year in tariffs, subsidies and other restrictions has been higher costs, weaker growth, financial instability and eroded trust. Importers’ efforts to “front-load” ahead of
tariff deadlines have intensified the disruption, especially for least developed countries that lack flexibility.
