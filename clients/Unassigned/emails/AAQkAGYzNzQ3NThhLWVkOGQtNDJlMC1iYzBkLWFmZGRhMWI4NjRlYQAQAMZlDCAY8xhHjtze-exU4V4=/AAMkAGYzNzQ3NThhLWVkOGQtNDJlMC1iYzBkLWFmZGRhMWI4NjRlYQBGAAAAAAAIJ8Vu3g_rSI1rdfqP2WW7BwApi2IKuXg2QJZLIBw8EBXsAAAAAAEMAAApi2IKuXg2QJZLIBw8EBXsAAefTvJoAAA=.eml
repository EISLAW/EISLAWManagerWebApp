A SHIFT IN THE NUCLEAR ORDER? [3]
A NEW ARMS RACE COULD SOON BE UPON US.
BY: RONAN WORDSWORTH
Following a visit with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Seoul had his approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine. At first glance, the announcement
seems like any other profitable deal over military hardware. However, because it was made in concert with the announcement that the United States would immediately resume nuclear testing, it could
mark the most significant break in the nuclear order since the end of the Cold War. There is potential for a profound shift in the global nuclear governance landscape, a break that could raise
concerns about the future integrity of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and set precedents with unpredictable consequences.
Trump’s decision to share U.S. nuclear submarine technology with South Korea builds directly on the precedent set by the AUKUS deal with Australia, according to which nuclear-powered submarine
technology was shared with close allies. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have always guarded the sensitive technology of nuclear propulsion tightly (it uses highly enriched uranium that could be
repurposed for weapons). The AUKUS agreement tried to cement nonproliferation standards by limiting fuel enrichment and reprocessing activities and by supplying sealed reactor units, but even these
measures left many in the arms control community uneasy, concerned as they were that the transfer would set a dangerous proliferation precedent.
The NPT, which was formally ratified at the U.N. level in 1970, lays out the conditions for nuclear and nonnuclear states to handle nuclear material for civilian and military purposes. Its three main
tenets are: nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, a disarmament process for nuclear states, and guidelines for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Under the treaty, the five U.N.
Security Council members (the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K. and France) were enshrined as nuclear powers committed to gradual disarmament; other states were not. The NPT has been successful in that
only four states have obtained nuclear weapons since the treaty’s ratification – Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. (North Korea was internationally isolated following its withdrawal from
the NPT and, in 2006, its first nuclear weapons test.) Per the NPT, the International Atomic Energy Agency is responsible for verifying nuclear sites, stockpiles and enrichment facilities. This makes
developing a nuclear weapon nearly impossible without being detected. Such was the case with Iran.
Importantly, the NPT contains a loophole: Article III of INFCIRC/153 allows for nonnuclear weapon states to receive nuclear material for “non-explosive military use,” such as naval propulsion,
outside full IAEA safeguards. Weapons-grade nuclear fuel in stockpiles intended for submarines, then, can theoretically exist outside the verification mechanisms typically designed to prevent
diversion to weapons programs. This could include more than 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of material enriched to weapons-grade (up to 90 percent) to be used for future fuel for submarines (roughly 50
kilograms is needed for a nuclear weapon). No nonnuclear weapons state has used this loophole, nor has any developed nuclear propulsion technology for military vessels. Australia and South Korea would
be the first.
In foreign policy terms, South Korea is in a sensitive situation. Despite assurances that the plan is for submarine fuel rather than weapons, Seoul has become increasingly nervous that Washington’s
grander disengagement plans would remove it from the nuclear umbrella. At the same time, North Korea is advancing its own nuclear weapons capabilities, further increasing the security threat to Seoul.
This predicament has compelled the government to hedge its bets such that in an extreme security crisis, fissile material could be covertly diverted toward a weapons program outside the IAEA’s
normal purview.
The move seems to be part of the larger trade deal signed between Seoul and Washington that includes a provision of $150 billion for shipbuilding cooperation. South Korea’s nuclear submarines will
reportedly be built in Philadelphia, though shipyards will need to be dramatically overhauled to handle nuclear construction. Considering Washington’s struggles to fulfill its own AUKUS commitments
to Australia, this could be a long time indeed.
The resumption of U.S. nuclear testing compounds the concerns. The U.S. has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since an underground test in 1992, maintaining deterrence credibility through
advanced simulations and stockpile stewardship. In breaking this norm, Washington risks legitimizing similar actions by Russia, China, India and even North Korea, all of which could justify their
actions as strategic necessity or reciprocity. The 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty – which was already weakened by Washington’s nonratification – could effectively collapse,
undermining one of the few remaining pillars of arms control.
Trump’s dual decisions erode the foundation on which the nuclear order is built. By reopening the NPT’s loopholes and resuming testing, there is a much higher risk of escalation and hedging, as
well as the potential for an arms race in Asia and beyond. Other states may exploit these precedents or remove their own restraints, raising the stakes for the entire global nonproliferation regime
and potentially giving rise to a new age of nuclear competition.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Following a visit =
with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, U.S. President Donald Trump anno=
unced that Seoul had his approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine. At =
first glance, the announcement seems like any other profitable deal over mi=
litary hardware. However, because it was made in concert with the announcem=
ent that the United States would immediately resume nuclear testing, it cou=
ld mark the most significant break in the nuclear order since the end of th=
e Cold War. There is potential for a profound shift in the global nuclear g=
overnance landscape, a break that could raise concerns about the future int=
egrity of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and set precedents wit=
h unpredictable consequences.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump=E2=80=99s de=
cision to share U.S. nuclear submarine technology with South Korea builds d=
irectly on the precedent set by the AUKUS deal with Australia, according to=
 which nuclear-powered submarine technology was shared with close allies. T=
he U.S. and the United Kingdom have always guarded the sensitive technology=
 of nuclear propulsion tightly (it uses highly enriched uranium that could =
be repurposed for weapons). The AUKUS agreement tried to cement nonprolifer=
ation standards by limiting fuel enrichment and reprocessing activities and=
 by supplying sealed reactor units, but even these measures left many in th=
e arms control community uneasy, concerned as they were that the transfer w=
ould set a dangerous proliferation precedent.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The NPT, which was=
 formally ratified at the U.N. level in 1970, lays out the conditions for n=
uclear and nonnuclear states to handle nuclear material for civilian and mi=
litary purposes. Its three main tenets are: nonproliferation of nuclear wea=
pons, a disarmament process for nuclear states, and guidelines for cooperat=
ion in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Under the treaty, the five U.N.=
 Security Council members (the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K. and France) we=
re enshrined as nuclear powers committed to gradual disarmament; other stat=
es were not. The NPT has been successful in that only four states have obta=
ined nuclear weapons since the treaty=E2=80=99s ratification =E2=80=93 Isra=
el, India, Pakistan and North Korea. (North Korea was internationally isola=
ted following its withdrawal from the NPT and, in 2006, its first nuclear w=
eapons test.) Per the NPT, the International Atomic Energy Agency is respon=
sible for verifying nuclear sites, stockpiles and enrichment facilities. Th=
is makes developing a nuclear weapon nearly impossible without being detect=
ed. Such was the case with Iran.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Importantly, the N=
PT contains a loophole: Article III of INFCIRC/153 allows for nonnuclear we=
apon states to receive nuclear material for =E2=80=9Cnon-explosive military=
 use,=E2=80=9D such as naval propulsion, outside full IAEA safeguards. Weap=
ons-grade nuclear fuel in stockpiles intended for submarines, then, can the=
oretically exist outside the verification mechanisms typically designed to =
prevent diversion to weapons programs. This could include more than 500 kil=
ograms (1,100 pounds) of material enriched to weapons-grade (up to 90 perce=
nt) to be used for future fuel for submarines (roughly 50 kilograms is need=
ed for a nuclear weapon). No nonnuclear weapons state has used this loophol=
e, nor has any developed nuclear propulsion technology for military vessels=
. Australia and South Korea would be the first.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In foreign policy =
terms, South Korea is in a sensitive situation. Despite assurances that the=
 plan is for submarine fuel rather than weapons, Seoul has become increasin=
gly nervous that Washington=E2=80=99s grander disengagement plans would rem=
ove it from the nuclear umbrella. At the same time, North Korea is advancin=
g its own nuclear weapons capabilities, further increasing the security thr=
eat to Seoul. This predicament has compelled the government to hedge its be=
ts such that in an extreme security crisis, fissile material could be cover=
tly diverted toward a weapons program outside the IAEA=E2=80=99s normal pur=
view.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The move seems to =
be part of the larger trade deal signed between Seoul and Washington that i=
ncludes a provision of $150 billion for shipbuilding cooperation. South Kor=
ea=E2=80=99s nuclear submarines will reportedly be built in Philadelphia, t=
hough shipyards will need to be dramatically overhauled to handle nuclear c=
onstruction. Considering Washington=E2=80=99s struggles to fulfill its own =
AUKUS commitments to Australia, this could be a long time indeed.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The resumption of =
U.S. nuclear testing compounds the concerns. The U.S. has observed a morato=
rium on nuclear testing since an underground test in 1992, maintaining dete=
rrence credibility through advanced simulations and stockpile stewardship. =
In breaking this norm, Washington risks legitimizing similar actions by Rus=
sia, China, India and even North Korea, all of which could justify their ac=
tions as strategic necessity or reciprocity. The 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear=
-Test-Ban Treaty =E2=80=93 which was already weakened by Washington=E2=80=
=99s nonratification =E2=80=93 could effectively collapse, undermining one =
of the few remaining pillars of arms control.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump=E2=80=99s du=
al decisions erode the foundation on which the nuclear order is built. By r=
eopening the NPT=E2=80=99s loopholes and resuming testing, there is a much =
higher risk of escalation and hedging, as well as the potential for an arms=
 race in Asia and beyond. Other states may exploit these precedents or remo=
ve their own restraints, raising the stakes for the entire global nonprolif=
eration regime and potentially giving rise to a new age of nuclear competit=
ion.</p>
