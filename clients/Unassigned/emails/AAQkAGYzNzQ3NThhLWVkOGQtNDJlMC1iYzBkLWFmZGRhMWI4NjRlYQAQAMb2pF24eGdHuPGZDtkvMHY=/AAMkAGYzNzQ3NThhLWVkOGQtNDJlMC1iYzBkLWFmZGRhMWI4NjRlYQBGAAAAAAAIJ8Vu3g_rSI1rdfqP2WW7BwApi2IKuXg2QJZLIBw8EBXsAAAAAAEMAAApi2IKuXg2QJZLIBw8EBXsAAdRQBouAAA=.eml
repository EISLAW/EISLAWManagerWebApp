STRATEGIC OPTIONS AS US-RUSSIA TALKS STALL [3]
ESCALATION IS ONLY ONE POSSIBILITY.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
U.S.-Russia talks over a settlement in Ukraine have largely stalled. On June 16, Moscow announced that Washington had unilaterally canceled the next round of negotiations, while the U.S.
simultaneously disbanded a key interagency working group tasked with pressuring Russia into a ceasefire. Moscow, for its part, has hardened its position. Former President and current Deputy Security
Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said talks were aimed at securing a swift Russian victory, not a compromise, signaling the Kremlin’s continued maximalist approach.
This diplomatic breakdown, coupled with intensifying Russian missile and drone attacks, places pressure on the Trump administration to demonstrate strength. Without visible resolve, Russia could
accelerate its advances, NATO cohesion may falter and U.S. credibility – already under scrutiny – would suffer globally. Recent U.S. airstrikes on Iran serve as a precedent: Force will be employed
as needed if a negotiated settlement, or talks toward that end, is not reached. In Ukraine, then, Washington is likely to adopt a strategy of deterrence.
The risk for the U.S. is to pursue its goals without triggering direct confrontation with Russia – and without compromising its own readiness. Domestic constraints, including “America First”
political currents and fiscal fatigue, further restrict Washington’s appetite for prolonged foreign commitments. Meanwhile, preoccupations with the Middle East, the South China Sea and the southern
U.S. border compete for strategic bandwidth. To offset these pressures, the U.S. has increased demands on European allies to assume greater responsibility for their defense, reducing its own footprint
and resource burden. This helps explain Washington’s restraint in greenlighting escalatory battlefield actions by Ukraine, particularly in its capacity to provide targeting data for HIMARS strikes,
despite clear Russian provocations.
It also helps explain why, although Russia has massed some 50,000 troops near Sumy and Kursk, it has yet to launch a major ground offensive. There has been increased indirect fire and drone activity
in the area, but there has been little movement of armor. Ukrainian and open-source satellite intelligence have tracked the buildup, yet there is no public evidence that U.S. authorities have approved
HIMARS strikes in response. The restraint evident on both sides is clearly a deliberate decision as a result of either logistical caution, a desire not to escalate the situation further, or
breakthroughs in backchannel talks.
Now that high-level talks have stalled and escalation has been quietly tabled, Washington faces a strategic dilemma: Should it remain constrained by the current status quo, or should it initiate a
sequenced military escalation designed to shift battlefield momentum and pressure Russia into serious negotiations to end hostilities?
To be sure, escalation isn’t linear; it consists of tiered frameworks shaped by U.S. imperatives and constraints. Each tier is carefully designed to respond to events as they unfold and can thus be
scaled back or abandoned altogether as the situation warrants. But no matter how careful or incremental the tiers may be, each carries with it an increased risk of direct confrontation.
Tier 1 would be activated in the current status quo, where major diplomacy remains stalled but Russian actions stay below the threshold of major escalation on the ground. It would consist primarily of
continued support and added low-visibility assistance. The goal would be to sustain current capabilities and reinforce deterrence without altering the battlefield geometry. Tier 1 would involve the
U.S. continuing to employ defensive measures such as cyber operations and the deployment of ISR platforms, and it would likely add more armor and artillery to the tons of armor and artillery
Washington has already sent to Ukraine. It would also continue to integrate targeting data, communications and satellite imagery, giving the U.S. the ability to help sustain defensive operations while
reserving the right to limit range and strike capability if it so chooses. In other words, Tier 1 would signal a steady commitment without crossing any Russian red lines.
Tier 2 would be activated in the event of intensified Russian military activity – massed offensives, deeper strikes on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, signs of diplomatic collapse and the like.
It would introduce conditional support designed to signal readiness for strategic escalation, with the ultimate goal of midlevel escalation and operational disruption without crossing Russian red
lines. It would give Ukraine the ability to target deeper logistical hubs, command and control centers, and troop concentrations with U.S.-supplied systems like the Patriots, HIMARS and ATACMS.
Loitering munitions and drones, such as the U.S. Switchblade and the Phoenix Ghost, would be resupplied. Importantly, this tier is constrained by the time it takes to deliver the weapons and train
Ukrainian forces to operate them. (Patriot missile systems, for example, require about a year to master.) Put simply, training takes time, resources and direct involvement from foreign military
instructors.
Tier 3 would be triggered if Russia escalates dramatically through large-scale offensives that threaten a Ukrainian collapse, an intensified strategic weapons campaign (including ballistic or
hypersonic missile barrages), nuclear signaling, high-volume strikes on critical infrastructure, or destabilizing actions that threaten NATO. It would introduce persistent ISR-to-strike integration
and expanded targeting of deep Russian infrastructure, airfields and strategic rails. Additional options could include use of the HIMARS-launched precision strike missile, the Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) system, or combat aircraft to be operated by Ukraine. The goal would be to deny Russia sanctuary and demonstrate U.S. strategic depth of commitment to the cause. These kinds of
measures – and the kinds of cyberattacks that would very likely accompany them – would certainly cross Russian red lines and would thus demand a Russian response. (They are also similarly
constrained as the options in Tier 2.)
The escalation framework relies not only on capability but also on the speed of delivery, integration and impact on the battlefield. Supplies such as ISR platforms, ammunition and vehicles can be
deployed within weeks through Poland. Satellite capabilities would be even faster. Effective U.S. military aid rests on matching logistical tempo to meet battlefield needs.
Crucially, each piece of equipment adds tension to U.S.-Russia relations. A tiered approach to escalation would allow Russia to respond – through diplomatic warnings, protests, hybrid options or
cyber retaliation. Moscow’s response pattern will likely escalate with each U.S. step. Yet so far, Russian moves seem to be geared toward delay, not provocation. (For example, Moscow has avoided
striking NATO territory, even as it blames the West for direct involvement.) The effectiveness of U.S. escalation will depend on whether Russia remains in a posture below war or becomes destabilizing
across the strategic threshold.
While each step adds complexity to U.S.-Russia relations, the broader logic of phased escalation remains intact. This approach offers a strategic tool to manage risk rather than invite it. Each tier,
from sustainment to operational disruption and strategic threat, matches U.S. capabilities with battlefield relevance. But speedy delivery, training capacity and logistical support, particularly
through Poland, determine whether these systems arrive in time to shape outcomes. Ultimately, the U.S. must weigh imperfect options in an unstable landscape. But one principle remains clear: Inaction
carries its own risk. The U.S. failing to reinforce Ukraine in meaningful, timely ways will cede initiative to Moscow, fracture allied confidence and embolden rival powers. A phased escalation
strategy, managed with strategic discipline, remains necessary and a measured tool for the U.S. to gain leverage, stabilize the front and prevent Russia from dictating the terms of peace.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">U.S.-Russia talks =
over a settlement in Ukraine have largely stalled. On June 16, Moscow annou=
nced that Washington had unilaterally canceled the next round of negotiatio=
ns, while the U.S. simultaneously disbanded a key interagency working group=
 tasked with pressuring Russia into a ceasefire. Moscow, for its part, has =
hardened its position. Former President and current Deputy Security Council=
 Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said talks were aimed at securing a swift Russian=
 victory, not a compromise, signaling the Kremlin=E2=80=99s continued maxim=
alist approach.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This diplomatic br=
eakdown, coupled with intensifying Russian missile and drone attacks, place=
s pressure on the Trump administration to demonstrate strength. Without vis=
ible resolve, Russia could accelerate its advances, NATO cohesion may falte=
r and U.S. credibility =E2=80=93 already under scrutiny =E2=80=93 would suf=
fer globally. Recent U.S. airstrikes on Iran serve as a precedent: Force wi=
ll be employed as needed if a negotiated settlement, or talks toward that e=
nd, is not reached. In Ukraine, then, Washington is likely to adopt a strat=
egy of deterrence.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The risk for the U=
.S. is to pursue its goals without triggering direct confrontation with Rus=
sia =E2=80=93 and without compromising its own readiness. Domestic constrai=
nts, including =E2=80=9CAmerica First=E2=80=9D political currents and fisca=
l fatigue, further restrict Washington=E2=80=99s appetite for prolonged for=
eign commitments. Meanwhile, preoccupations with the Middle East, the South=
 China Sea and the southern U.S. border compete for strategic bandwidth. To=
 offset these pressures, the U.S. has increased demands on European allies =
to assume greater responsibility for their defense, reducing its own footpr=
int and resource burden. This helps explain Washington=E2=80=99s restraint =
in greenlighting escalatory battlefield actions by Ukraine, particularly in=
 its capacity to provide targeting data for HIMARS strikes, despite clear R=
ussian provocations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It also helps expl=
ain why, although Russia has massed some 50,000 troops near Sumy and Kursk,=
 it has yet to launch a major ground offensive. There has been increased in=
direct fire and drone activity in the area, but there has been little movem=
ent of armor. Ukrainian and open-source satellite intelligence have tracked=
 the buildup, yet there is no public evidence that U.S. authorities have ap=
proved HIMARS strikes in response. The restraint evident on both sides is c=
learly a deliberate decision as a result of either logistical caution, a de=
sire not to escalate the situation further, or breakthroughs in backchannel=
 talks.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Now that high-leve=
l talks have stalled and escalation has been quietly tabled, Washington fac=
es a strategic dilemma: Should it remain constrained by the current status =
quo, or should it initiate a sequenced military escalation designed to shif=
t battlefield momentum and pressure Russia into serious negotiations to end=
 hostilities?</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To be sure, escala=
tion isn=E2=80=99t linear; it consists of tiered frameworks shaped by U.S. =
imperatives and constraints. Each tier is carefully designed to respond to =
events as they unfold and can thus be scaled back or abandoned altogether a=
s the situation warrants. But no matter how careful or incremental the tier=
s may be, each carries with it an increased risk of direct confrontation.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Tier 1 would be ac=
tivated in the current status quo, where major diplomacy remains stalled bu=
t Russian actions stay below the threshold of major escalation on the groun=
d. It would consist primarily of continued support and added low-visibility=
 assistance. The goal would be to sustain current capabilities and reinforc=
e deterrence without altering the battlefield geometry. Tier 1 would involv=
e the U.S. continuing to employ defensive measures such as cyber operations=
 and the deployment of ISR platforms, and it would likely add more armor an=
d artillery to the tons of armor and artillery Washington has already sent =
to Ukraine. It would also continue to integrate targeting data, communicati=
ons and satellite imagery, giving the U.S. the ability to help sustain defe=
nsive operations while reserving the right to limit range and strike capabi=
lity if it so chooses. In other words, Tier 1 would signal a steady commitm=
ent without crossing any Russian red lines.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Tier 2 would be ac=
tivated in the event of intensified Russian military activity =E2=80=93 mas=
sed offensives, deeper strikes on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, signs =
of diplomatic collapse and the like. It would introduce conditional support=
 designed to signal readiness for strategic escalation, with the ultimate g=
oal of midlevel escalation and operational disruption without crossing Russ=
ian red lines. It would give Ukraine the ability to target deeper logistica=
l hubs, command and control centers, and troop concentrations with U.S.-sup=
plied systems like the Patriots, HIMARS and ATACMS. Loitering munitions and=
 drones, such as the U.S. Switchblade and the Phoenix Ghost, would be resup=
plied. Importantly, this tier is constrained by the time it takes to delive=
r the weapons and train Ukrainian forces to operate them. (Patriot missile =
systems, for example, require about a year to master.) Put simply, training=
 takes time, resources and direct involvement from foreign military instruc=
tors.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Tier 3 would be tr=
iggered if Russia escalates dramatically through large-scale offensives tha=
t threaten a Ukrainian collapse, an intensified strategic weapons campaign =
(including ballistic or hypersonic missile barrages), nuclear signaling, hi=
gh-volume strikes on critical infrastructure, or destabilizing actions that=
 threaten NATO. It would introduce persistent ISR-to-strike integration and=
 expanded targeting of deep Russian infrastructure, airfields and strategic=
 rails. Additional options could include use of the HIMARS-launched precisi=
on strike missile, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, =
or combat aircraft to be operated by Ukraine. The goal would be to deny Rus=
sia sanctuary and demonstrate U.S. strategic depth of commitment to the cau=
se. These kinds of measures =E2=80=93 and the kinds of cyberattacks that wo=
uld very likely accompany them =E2=80=93 would certainly cross Russian red =
lines and would thus demand a Russian response. (They are also similarly co=
nstrained as the options in Tier 2.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The escalation fra=
mework relies not only on capability but also on the speed of delivery, int=
egration and impact on the battlefield. Supplies such as ISR platforms, amm=
unition and vehicles can be deployed within weeks through Poland. Satellite=
 capabilities would be even faster. Effective U.S. military aid rests on ma=
tching logistical tempo to meet battlefield needs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Crucially, each pi=
ece of equipment adds tension to U.S.-Russia relations. A tiered approach t=
o escalation would allow Russia to respond =E2=80=93 through diplomatic war=
nings, protests, hybrid options or cyber retaliation. Moscow=E2=80=99s resp=
onse pattern will likely escalate with each U.S. step. Yet so far, Russian =
moves seem to be geared toward delay, not provocation. (For example, Moscow=
 has avoided striking NATO territory, even as it blames the West for direct=
 involvement.) The effectiveness of U.S. escalation will depend on whether =
Russia remains in a posture below war or becomes destabilizing across the s=
trategic threshold.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While each step ad=
ds complexity to U.S.-Russia relations, the broader logic of phased escalat=
ion remains intact. This approach offers a strategic tool to manage risk ra=
ther than invite it. Each tier, from sustainment to operational disruption =
and strategic threat, matches U.S. capabilities with battlefield relevance.=
 But speedy delivery, training capacity and logistical support, particularl=
y through Poland, determine whether these systems arrive in time to shape o=
utcomes. Ultimately, the U.S. must weigh imperfect options in an unstable l=
andscape. But one principle remains clear: Inaction carries its own risk. T=
he U.S. failing to reinforce Ukraine in meaningful, timely ways will cede i=
nitiative to Moscow, fracture allied confidence and embolden rival powers. =
A phased escalation strategy, managed with strategic discipline, remains ne=
cessary and a measured tool for the U.S. to gain leverage, stabilize the fr=
ont and prevent Russia from dictating the terms of peace.</p>
