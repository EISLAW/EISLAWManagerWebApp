So o3 Pro kept me up late last night. And I realized just how many major mo=
del releases we=E2=80=99ve had in just the first 5 months of the year. We=
=E2=80=99ve had at least 12 [ https://substack.com/redirect/2e0ca31a-e83d-4=
ad9-8f05-abd6c8755ace?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6=
RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], and that=E2=80=99s like one massive model drop every 10is=
h days all year. My gut says 12 is undercounting.
So I=E2=80=99ve been drowning, and everyone around me is drowning more than=
 me! So my instinct is to build a life raft. How can I build a dashboard th=
at ranks models that=E2=80=99s customizable to you, that isn=E2=80=99t over=
whelming, that incorporates relevant benchmarks as well, and that is quick =
and easy to scan?
It took quite a few iterations, and in the end I got to something I feel pr=
etty good about shipping as an MVP. Let me know what you think!
Small note for free subscribers: this is my monthly building-with-AI demo p=
ost, hope you enjoy! Lots more good stuff like this weekly behind the paywa=

We're All Drowning Here
I was drowning in AI model releases. You're drowning in AI model releases. =
We're all drowning in AI model releases.
Let me paint you the full picture of 2025 so far - at least 12 major model =
releases in just under six months:
January 20: DeepSeek drops R1 (671B parameters)
January 29: Alibaba releases Qwen 2.5-Max
February 17: xAI launches Grok 3
February 27: OpenAI unveils GPT-4.5 "Orion"
March 12: Google open-sources Gemma 3
March 25: Google releases Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental)
April 5: Meta launches Llama 4 Scout AND Maverick
April 16: OpenAI releases o3 AND GPT-o4-mini (same day!)
April 29: Alibaba's back with Qwen 3
May 22-23: Anthropic announces Claude Opus 4 AND Sonnet 4
June 5: Google updates Gemini 2.5 Pro (again)
June 10: OpenAI releases o3 Pro AND slashes o3's price by 80%
That's more than two models per month. By the time you've tested one, three=
 more have launched. By the time you've integrated one into your workflow, =
it's already "outdated."
The worst part? We're not just drowning in releases - we're drowning trying=
 to make sense of it all. Every model claims state-of-the-art performance. =
Every benchmark tells a different story. The model that crushes AIME mathem=
atics can't write a coherent email. The one that tops the coding leaderboar=
d fails at basic tool use.
This dashboard is my life raft. My attempt to bring some sanity to the chao=
s. A way to track what actually matters: how these models perform in real l=
ife, not just in benchmarks.
The Problem That Started It All
The breaking point came on June 10. While everyone was celebrating o3 Pro's=
 launch and debating whether the 80% price cut on standard o3 was a "Gemini=
 killer," I was dealing with the reality: ChatGPT was down for 10 hours tha=
t same day. The irony wasn't lost on me - new model launches while existing=
 ones couldn't stay online.
Meanwhile, I'd been using Claude Sonnet 4 (released May 22) for weeks and f=
inding it consistently outperformed models with higher benchmark scores in =
my actual coding work. The disconnect between published metrics and reality=
 was maddening.
So I built something better: a dashboard that creates composite scores comb=
ining validated benchmark data with my actual hands-on experience across si=
x key dimensions.
What It Looks Like
Here=E2=80=99s a link [ https://substack.com/redirect/a244bc8b-b094-4e29-9f=
ab-6c9555434941?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tA=
jMRMPOw0 ] to the dashboard.=20
Here=E2=80=99s the overall view:
Here=E2=80=99s the top 3, just for fun (you can tune the slider)
I am a very hard grader! Most of the models score better on leaderboards th=
an I score them.
What This Dashboard Actually Does
This isn't just another leaderboard regurgitating benchmark scores. It's a =
living document that reflects how these models perform in the real world, w=
eighted by what matters to YOU. Yes you.=20
After building it, I immediately cranked my personal experience weighting u=
p to 70% (from the default 60/40 split). Why? Because I trust my own experi=
ence more than benchmarks. But here's the beauty - you might trust benchmar=
ks more, and that's fine. The slider is there for you to adjust.
The dashboard calculates a composite score (0-100) for each model using:
Your chosen split between objective benchmarks and personal experience (I u=
se 30/70, you might prefer 50/50 or even 80/20)
Your category priorities - care more about coding than writing? Crank up th=
e coding weight. Need amazing tool use? Make that 40% of your personal scor=
e.
But here's the key innovation: instead of one generic "overall" rating, you=
 rate each model on six specific dimensions:
Coding: How well it generates, debugs, and refactors code
Writing: Clarity, creativity, and tone control
Reasoning: Logic, mathematical thinking, complex analysis
Reading: Document comprehension and context understanding
Tool Use: Function calling, API integration, multi-step workflows
Insightfulness: Ability to provide unexpected connections and "aha moments"
The Power of Double Customization
What makes this dashboard special is the two-layer customization:
Layer 1: Trust Level
The benchmark/personal slider asks: "How much do you trust published benchm=
arks vs your own experience?"
I landed at 30% benchmarks, 70% personal because:
Benchmarks are gamed and artificial
My actual usage patterns matter more
But benchmarks still provide some signal
You might be more skeptical of your limited experience and set it to 60% be=
nchmarks. Or you might have used these models extensively and go full 90% p=
ersonal. There's no right answer - only what's right for you.
Layer 2: Task Priorities
The category weights ask: "What actually matters for your work?"
My weights evolved to:
Coding: 10% (critical but not everything)
Reasoning: 25% (complex problems need good thinking)
Writing: 15% (communication matters)
Reading: 10% (context understanding is key)
Tool Use: 15% (when it works, it's magical)
Insightfulness: 25% (those "aha moments" are gold)
But if you're a software engineer, maybe coding becomes 40%. If you're a co=
ntent creator, writing might be 35%. The dashboard reshapes itself around Y=
OUR needs.
The Technical Journey: How I Built This
Step 1: Validating the Benchmark Data
I started by web-scraping current benchmark scores from multiple sources. T=
his was crucial - with models launching every 2-3 weeks, many dashboards us=
e outdated data. I pulled from:
Official model announcements (OpenAI's June 10 o3 Pro release, Anthropic's =
May 22 Claude 4 announcement, Google's March 25 Gemini 2.5 launch, etc.)
LMSYS Arena leaderboard data
Academic benchmark repositories
Third-party evaluation sites
For each model, I normalized scores to a 0-100 scale. For example, Claude O=
pus 4's 79.4% on SWE-bench became part of its overall 74/100 benchmark scor=
e.
Step 2: Designing the Rating System
The breakthrough came when I realized overall ratings are useless. Nobody u=
ses an AI model for "everything" - we use them for specific tasks. So I imp=
lemented:
Half-star precision: I set granular half point ratings of 3.5, 4.5, etc. Th=
is matters because the difference between 4 and 4.5 stars is often the diff=
erence between "good" and "great".
Dynamic weighting: Both the benchmark/personal split AND the category weigh=
ts are adjustable IN REAL TIME. Move a slider and watch the rankings instan=
tly reorganize. This isn't just cool - it helps you understand which models=
 excel where.
Visual feedback: Each rating shows its numeric value (e.g., "4.5") so you k=
now exactly what you've selected.
Right now, you can=E2=80=99t set the star ratings yourself. But you can for=
k the code and change the ratings that way.
Step 3: The Composite Score Algorithm
Here's the actual calculation if you=E2=80=99re curious:
const calculateComposite =3D (model) =3D> {
  // Get benchmark score (0-100)
  const benchScore =3D benchmarkScores[model].raw.overall;
 =20
  // Calculate weighted personal score based on YOUR priorities
  const ratings =3D personalRatings[model];
  const weightedPersonal =3D (
    ratings.coding * categoryWeights.coding +
    ratings.writing * categoryWeights.writing +
    ratings.reasoning * categoryWeights.reasoning +
    ratings.reading * categoryWeights.reading +
    ratings.toolUse * categoryWeights.toolUse +
    ratings.insightfulness * categoryWeights.insightfulness
  ) / 100 * 20; // Convert 1-5 to 0-100
 =20
  // Combine based on YOUR trust level
  return Math.round(
    benchScore * userWeights.benchmarks/100 +=20
    weightedPersonal * userWeights.personal/100
  );
};

This gives us a single number that actually means something - it reflects b=
oth measurable performance AND your experience, weighted exactly how YOU wa=
nt it.
Step 4: The UI Design Philosophy
I went through three major iterations:
Version 1: Tried to show everything - charts, radar graphs, detailed breakd=
owns. It was overwhelming. (Ironically, I was drowning in my own solution t=
o drowning.)
Version 2: Stripped it back too far - just a simple list. Lost important co=
ntext.
Version 3 (Final): Found an ok sweet spot for an MVP:
Clean cards with just enough information visible
Expandable sections for details
Color coding by company (green for OpenAI, purple for Anthropic, etc.)
Quick stats that matter: benchmark score, personal score, average rating, v=
alue, speed
Most importantly: those adjustment sliders front and center
Step 5: Making It Actually Useful
The killer features that emerged:
Real-time weight adjustments: This is the magic. Slide the benchmark/person=
al ratio and watch o3 Pro and Claude Opus 4 trade places. Boost the coding =
weight and see Sonnet 4 climb. It's not just interactive - it's educational=
=2E
Value indicators: That $ indicator is admittedly a little bit vibes based. =
Just gives you a sense of value per price point without getting too bogged =
down in prices that change all the time.
Speed indicators: "Slow/Med/Fast" helps set expectations. o3 Pro might be a=
mazing, but if you need quick responses, your personal workflow might favor=
 Sonnet 4.
What I Learned About Each Model (At My 70/30 Weighting)
After implementing my ratings and adjusting to 70% personal weighting, clea=
r patterns emerged:
o3 Pro (June 10, 2025) dominates in reasoning and insightfulness (5 and 4.5=
 stars) but so far struggles with reading comprehension (3 stars). I=E2=80=
=99m still trying to figure out what=E2=80=99s going on there because that=
=E2=80=99s a bit surprising.
o3 (April 16, 2025) is very strong across the board, especially at reasonin=
g and tool-use. Because I value those highly, I tend to reach for it as a d=
aily driver, tolerating the fact that it=E2=80=99s a less fluent writer bec=
ause I can read the technical shorthand easily.
Claude Opus 4 (May 22, 2025) is Mr. Consistent - 4 stars across the board. =
Not the best at anything, but reliably good at everything. This consistency=
 plays well with any weighting scheme. I find myself turning to Opus really=
 frequently.
Claude Sonnet 4 (May 22, 2025) surprised me. Despite being the "lighter" Cl=
aude model released the same day as Opus, it matches or beats Opus at codin=
g (I admit I=E2=80=99m not as much of an engineer as some here) and reading=
 while being 5x cheaper in API. It=E2=80=99s a model that=E2=80=99s growing=
 on me.
Gemini 2.5 Pro (Updated June 5, 2025, originally March 25) has that massive=
 1M token context window, yet scored only 2.5 stars for tool use. The bench=
mark hype (LMSYS #1!) matters less when personal experience is weighted hea=
vily, but it also allows me to be honest about my experience while leaving =
room for you to adjust it if you have a different perspective. It=E2=80=99s=
 a model that in my experience is very strong but slightly underperforms it=
s benchmarks, and I probably penalize pretty heavily for interface and surf=
ace availability (which Gemini is this in which Google property?)
ChatGPT-4o - the former king - now sits near the bottom. 1 star for tool us=
e, 2 stars for coding. High benchmark scores can't save it when personal we=
ight is 70%. Again, I am leaning heavily on hard scoring here. I also perso=
nally believe if you have 5 stars you should use all 5 in a sample. So some=
body has to suck!=20
Llama 4 Scout (April 5, 2025) is the open-source contender that... isn't re=
ally contending. Despite boasting a 10M token context window and 521k+ down=
loads, it scores 1-2 stars across most categories. No amount of weight adju=
stment saves it. I may be slightly harsh here, but I=E2=80=99m probably pen=
alizing Meta=E2=80=99s struggles with the Llama 4 generation overall.
(Note: I'm not tracking DeepSeek R1, Qwen models, or Grok 3 in this dashboa=
rd yet - another drowning problem!)
Why This Approach Matters
Benchmarks lie. Not intentionally, but they measure performance in artifici=
al conditions. My dashboard reveals that:
Your workflow is unique: My 70/30 split and category weights won't match yo=
urs, AND THAT'S THE POINT
Value varies by use case: What you=E2=80=99re willing to pay is going to de=
pend on what activity you care about
Specialization beats generalization: Adjust weights to find which model tru=
ly excels at what YOU need
Tool use is still primitive: Nobody is doing super great here, but I expect=
 this to get much much better in 6 months
Trust is personal: Some people need published proof. Others trust their gut=
=2E The slider respects both.
Areas for Future Improvement (Self-Critique)
Building this dashboard taught me as much about what's missing as what's wo=
rking:
1. Model Coverage Gaps
I'm only tracking 7 models when there have been 12+ major releases in 2025.=
 Where's DeepSeek R1? Qwen 3? Grok 3? The dashboard needs to expand, but ad=
ding models means more testing, more ratings, more drowning. Need to automa=
te this.
2. Historical Context Missing
The dashboard shows current scores but not trends. Did my opinion of Claude=
 Opus 4 change after o3 Pro launched? How did the June 10 price cut affect =
my value calculations? Historical tracking would add crucial context.
3. Community Input Lacking
My ratings are just that - mine. Aggregating community ratings (while maint=
aining personal customization) could provide valuable perspective. What if =
1000 of us rated these models? Would we all converge to mid Google 4.5 slop=
? Or would it be useful?
4. Task-Specific Depth Would Be Ideal
"Coding" is too broad. There's a difference between Python scripting, React=
 components, and SQL queries. Same for "writing" - technical documentation =
vs creative fiction. More granular categories would improve accuracy, but g=
enerate a ton more work.
5. Benchmark Validation Challenges
I'm trusting published benchmarks, but we've seen manipulation. Independent=
 verification would strengthen the objective component.
6. Speed/Latency Not Quantified
My "Slow/Med/Fast" indicators are subjective. Real latency measurements (ti=
me to first token, tokens per second) would be more useful.
7. Context Window Utilization Unmeasured
Gemini has 1M tokens, Llama 4 has 10M, but can they actually USE them effec=
tively? This dimension is missing entirely.
8. Model Availability Ignored
Some models have waitlists, regional restrictions, or require enterprise co=
ntracts. The "best" model you can't access isn't helpful.
9. Update Frequency Problem
With 2+ models launching monthly, keeping ratings current is exhausting. Th=
e dashboard needs a more sustainable update mechanism.
10. Export/Sharing Limited
You can't save your configuration or share it with your team. For a tool ab=
out personalization, it's ironically siloed.
The Bottom Line
We're drowning in AI models - 12+ major releases in under six months, and a=
ccelerating. But we don't have to drown in confusion.
This dashboard proves that the "best" AI model is deeply personal - and now=
 your ranking is also deeply customizable. What matters for my coding-heavy=
, insight-seeking, benchmark-skeptical workflow might be completely differe=
nt from your writing-focused, benchmark-trusting needs.
The beauty is that now we have a framework that adapts to these differences=
=2E Move the sliders. Change the weight=
s. Make it yours. Because there's no u=
niversal "best" model - only the best model for YOU, at YOUR trust levels, =
for YOUR specific needs.
And in this ocean of model releases, that personalized clarity is the only =
lifeline that matters. Whether it's the next Tuesday with three releases or=
 the next month with ten, you'll have a way to make sense of it all.
Even if that way is imperfect, incomplete, and constantly playing catch-up =
- just like all of us in the AI space right now.

LQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Fork it, modify the ratings, adjust the=
 weights to match YOUR reality. Start with the sliders - find your trust le=
vel, define your priorities. Because your experience matters more than any =
benchmark ever will, and now you can prove it with numbers. Just don't expe=
ct it to stay current for long.

color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The breaking point=
 came on June 10. While everyone was celebrating o3 Pro's launch and debati=
ng whether the 80% price cut on standard o3 was a &quot;Gemini killer,&quot=
; I was dealing with the reality: ChatGPT was down for 10 hours that same d=
ay. The irony wasn't lost on me - new model launches while existing ones co=
uldn't stay online.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Meanwhile, I'd been using Claude Sonnet=
 4 (released May 22) for weeks and finding it consistently outperformed mod=
els with higher benchmark scores in my actual coding work. The disconnect b=
etween published metrics and reality was maddening.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So I bu=

alidated benchmark data with my actual hands-on experience across six key d=
