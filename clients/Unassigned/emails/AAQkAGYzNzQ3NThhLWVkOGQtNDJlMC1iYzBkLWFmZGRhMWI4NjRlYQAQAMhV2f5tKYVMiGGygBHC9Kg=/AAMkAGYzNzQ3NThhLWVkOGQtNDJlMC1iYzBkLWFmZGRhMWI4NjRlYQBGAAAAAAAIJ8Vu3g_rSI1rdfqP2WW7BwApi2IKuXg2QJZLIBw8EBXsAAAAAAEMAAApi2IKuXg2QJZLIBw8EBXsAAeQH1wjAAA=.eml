fluency-assessment-for-everyone

I get really tired of AI tests online. Everyone uses ChatGPT. Everyone does=
 their best.
Everyone says they have the skills (or hopes they do and hopes you won=E2=
=80=99t check.)
Measuring AI skills is become near-impossible on job interviews, and at the=
 same time showing those skills is brutally hard for the rest of us.
How can the most important skill in the new world of AI be this hard to mea=
sure??!
I=E2=80=99ve talked to hundreds of job seekers and hiring managers in the l=
ast year, and there are three big reasons why AI fluency is impossible to m=
easure right now:
The skill sets are changing so fast (like every new ChatGPT release)
AI is changing the jobs themselves really fast=E2=80=94so what=E2=80=99s ne=
eded?
We lack a common vocabulary for AI skills=E2=80=94so who knows what=E2=80=
=99s good?
Put simply, I=E2=80=99m aiming to tackle all three of those with this post.=
=20
If you are interested in leveling up your AI skills, this tells you where y=
ou are and what you need to work on
This is true for engineers as much as for non-technical roles
It also holds true across levels
Why? I designed it to measure foundational AI fluency levels we all need
If you=E2=80=99re hiring for AI, this is the first foundational level, job-=
independent AI assessment out there
And yes, it=E2=80=99s hard to game in interviews! (I made it that way on pu=
rpose)
This is also the first intentionally future-proofed AI fluency assessment
I built it anticipating future AI developments
It=E2=80=99s designed to flex and grow with future releases
How does all this work?
Well first, I=E2=80=99ll explain and lay out the framework for my competenc=
y assessment. I=E2=80=99m measuring:
Prompt mastery
Technical understanding (NOT code)
 Practical application ability
Critical evaluation ability
Workflow design ability
I explain how I weight those and why, and then I give you a guided, accessi=
ble assessment that walks you through the test step by step. All you have t=
o do is have a quiet place to think and a willingness to be honest (it=E2=
=80=99s ok it gets better!)
Then I give you a comprehensive scoring prompt PLUS a custom 90 day level u=
p prompt that will take your scores and work with you to develop a level up=
 prompt to get you where you want to go.
In addition, I have my own notes as a seasoned AI watcher=E2=80=94how diffe=
rent fluency levels look and present in different contexts, what skills are=
 involved, how they will evolve in the future. Super useful stuff!
I=E2=80=99ve even got notes for coaches and teachers here=E2=80=94stuff you=
 can read as you implement this test in a classroom setting or as HR with a=
 team.
I hope you enjoy, and best of luck leveling up on AI in this wild new world=
 we all are living in together!

The AI Fluency Assessment for Everyone
There=E2=80=99s a specific moment I see repeatedly when working with smart =
people on their AI workflows. They=E2=80=99ll show me how they use ChatGPT =
or Claude, walking me through their process with confidence. Then I=E2=80=
=99ll ask them to solve a specific problem=E2=80=94something practical, lik=
e drafting a technical proposal or analyzing a dataset. And within thirty s=
econds, I can tell exactly where they sit on the skill spectrum.
Usually, it=E2=80=99s lower than they think.
This isn=E2=80=99t about intelligence. The executives, founders, and profes=
sionals I work with are brilliant. But AI fluency is a distinct skill set, =
and most people have no reliable way to gauge their actual competence. You =
can=E2=80=99t see the gap between your current approach and what=E2=80=99s =
possible until someone shows you what advanced usage actually looks like.
Here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve learned: The difference between a competen=
t AI user (call it a 5 or 6 out of 10) and an advanced user (7 or 8) is wor=
th somewhere between 10 and 15 hours of productive output per week. That=E2=
=80=99s not hype=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s the difference between having docum=
ented workflows with specific prompt patterns versus winging it every time.=
 And by 2026, that gap will likely determine who advances in their career a=
nd who plateaus.
The problem is measurement. You can feel when you=E2=80=99re getting value =
from AI, but you don=E2=80=99t know if you=E2=80=99re at 40% of what=E2=80=
=99s possible or 80%. You don=E2=80=99t know which skills you=E2=80=99re mi=
ssing or what would unlock the next level of capability. You=E2=80=99re dri=
ving without a speedometer, assuming you=E2=80=99re doing fine while others=
 who=E2=80=99ve cracked the code are lapping you.
So here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve built: a self-assessment framework that=
 lets you accurately score your AI fluency in under 20 minutes. More import=
antly, it shows you exactly what separates each level, so you can see where=
 you actually stand and what specific skills move you up the ladder.
This isn=E2=80=99t an academic exercise. Your score tells you whether you=
=E2=80=99re in the danger zone, coasting, or building genuine competitive a=
dvantage. And it gives you a clear roadmap for what to learn next.
The Five Components That Actually Matter
AI fluency isn=E2=80=99t one skill=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a cluster of relate=
d capabilities. After working with hundreds of people at different skill le=
vels, I=E2=80=99ve identified five components that predict actual performan=
ce. Here=E2=80=99s how they break down and how much each one matters to you=
r overall competence.
1. Prompt Mastery (40% of your score)
This is the foundation, which is why it carries the most weight. But prompt=
 mastery isn=E2=80=99t just about writing clear instructions=E2=80=94it=E2=
=80=99s about architecting prompts that consistently produce the results yo=
u need.
There=E2=80=99s a progression here that most people don=E2=80=99t see. At t=
he beginning, you=E2=80=99re writing prompts the way you=E2=80=99d ask a ju=
nior assistant for help: =E2=80=9CWrite a blog post about AI.=E2=80=9D That=
=E2=80=99s a Level 2. You=E2=80=99ll get something back, but it won=E2=80=
=99t be what you actually need.
By Level 5, you=E2=80=99ve learned to add specificity and context: =E2=80=
=9CWrite a 1,000-word blog post for technical founders about prompt enginee=
ring. Focus on ROI rather than theory. Use a direct, practical tone.=E2=80=
=9D This is competent. You=E2=80=99ll get usable output.
But Level 8 looks completely different. You=E2=80=99re not just adding deta=
ils=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re designing the entire interaction: =E2=80=9CYou=
=E2=80=99re writing for technical founders who=E2=80=99ve tried AI tools an=
d been underwhelmed. They=E2=80=99re skeptical about reliability and unclea=
r on ROI. Address those specific objections directly. Use the three-stage f=
ramework I outlined earlier for content generation, and include one concret=
e example of time savings. Format as scannable sections with clear headers.=
 Target 1,200 words.=E2=80=9D
See the difference? You=E2=80=99re not just being specific=E2=80=94you=E2=
=80=99re anticipating objections, referencing previous context, specifying =
format, and building in validation criteria. This is prompt architecture, n=
ot just prompt writing.
The progression continues to Level 10, where you=E2=80=99re designing multi=
-turn workflows, building custom GPTs or Claude Projects with specific inst=
ructions, and creating prompt libraries for repeatable tasks. But the key i=
nsight is that each level requires learning new patterns, not just practici=
ng what you already know.
2. Technical Understanding (15% of your score)
You don=E2=80=99t need to understand how transformers work or what attentio=
n mechanisms are. But you do need to know which tool to use when, what thei=
r limitations are, and how to work around those constraints.
A Level 2 user knows that ChatGPT exists. A Level 5 user knows that Claude =
is better for long-form analysis, GPT-4 is faster for quick tasks, and Perp=
lexity is the right choice when you need current information with citations=
=2E A Level 8 user understands token li=
mits, knows how to structure informati=
on to work within context windows, and can explain why a task failed and ho=
w to fix it.
This isn=E2=80=99t about technical credentials=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s about p=
ractical knowledge that makes you effective. You need to understand enough =
to make good decisions about tool selection and troubleshoot when things go=
 wrong.
3. Practical Application (20% of your score)
This measures whether you=E2=80=99ve actually integrated AI into your real =
workflows or if you=E2=80=99re just experimenting with it occasionally.
A Level 3 user might use ChatGPT for everything, regardless of whether it=
=E2=80=99s the right tool. A Level 6 user has specific use cases where AI p=
rovides consistent value=E2=80=94maybe content drafting, data analysis, or =
research synthesis. A Level 8 user has built multi-tool workflows with clea=
r handoffs: web search for current information, Claude for analysis, a spec=
ialized tool for formatting or visualization.
The key here is systematization. Can you describe your process for common t=
asks, or do you start from scratch every time? Have you documented what wor=
ks, or are you relying on memory and intuition?
4. Critical Evaluation (15% of your score)
Advanced AI users know that the output is a starting point, not a finished =
product. They=E2=80=99ve developed validation habits that catch errors, bia=
s, and hallucinations before they cause problems.
This isn=E2=80=99t about paranoia=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s about professional s=
tandards. A Level 3 user takes output at face value. A Level 6 user spot-ch=
ecks for accuracy and rewrites anything that sounds off. A Level 8 user has=
 systematic verification processes: checking citations, validating logic, c=
omparing outputs across models, and maintaining healthy skepticism about an=
ything that seems too convenient.
The ability to evaluate output critically is what separates people who get =
burned by AI mistakes from people who use AI reliably in high-stakes situat=
ions.
5. Workflow Design (10% of your score)
This is the advanced skill that most people never develop. It=E2=80=99s the=
 difference between =E2=80=9CI use AI for writing=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CI h=
ave a three-stage content pipeline that produces consistently high-quality =
output.=E2=80=9D
A Level 6 user has informal processes=E2=80=94they know what generally work=
s. A Level 8 user has documented workflows they can teach to others or repl=
icate across different contexts. A Level 10 user is designing systems that =
other people can use, building custom tools, and solving problems that seem=
 impossible to people at lower skill levels.
This component carries less weight because it=E2=80=99s only relevant at hi=
gher skill levels. But if you want to move from good to exceptional, workfl=
ow design is what gets you there.
The Self-Test: Where Are You Actually?
Enough theory. Let=E2=80=99s figure out where you stand. I=E2=80=99ve desig=
ned three tests you can run right now=E2=80=94no scoring rubric needed. The=
 quality of your approach will make your level self-evident.
NOTE: This is the loose =E2=80=9Cget the concept=E2=80=9D version of the te=
st. If you want a more formal version of this test, it=E2=80=99s right here=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/4df3f272-68ab-4d26-89d6-3ca2beb72020?j=3De=
yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] (and I dis=
cuss it more below).
Test 1: The Specificity Challenge
Take this vague request and turn it into a prompt that would produce excell=
ent results:
Starting prompt: =E2=80=9CHelp me write a proposal for a potential client.=
=E2=80=9D
Now stop and actually write your improved version before reading further.
Here=E2=80=99s how to interpret your result:
If you added basic details (who the client is, what you=E2=80=99re proposin=
g, rough word count): You=E2=80=99re probably a 3-4. You understand that sp=
ecificity matters, but you=E2=80=99re still thinking about AI as a simple r=
equest-response tool.
If you included persona, context, format, and constraints (the client=E2=80=
=99s industry and pain points, your specific solution, the tone and structu=
re you need, objections to address): You=E2=80=99re likely a 5-6. You=E2=80=
=99re thinking architecturally about the prompt, not just adding informatio=
n.
If you designed a multi-step process (first research the client=E2=80=99s i=
ndustry and competitors, then draft key sections addressing specific criter=
ia, finally refine for tone and format=E2=80=94with validation checkpoints =
built in): You=E2=80=99re operating at a 7-8 level. You=E2=80=99re not just=
 prompting; you=E2=80=99re designing a workflow.
The gap between these approaches isn=E2=80=99t subtle. A Level 4 prompt mig=
ht save you 30 minutes. A Level 7 workflow might save you four hours and pr=
oduce better output than you could create manually.
Test 2: The Iteration Test
This test reveals whether you know how to work with AI or just use AI.
Pick any piece of AI-generated content=E2=80=94something you=E2=80=99ve cre=
ated recently or something you generate right now. Your task: improve it th=
rough prompting alone. No manual editing allowed.
One revision attempt, general feedback (=E2=80=9DMake this better=E2=80=9D =
or =E2=80=9CThis needs to be more professional=E2=80=9D): Level 3. You=E2=
=80=99re treating AI like a black box and hoping for improvement.
Multiple targeted revisions (=E2=80=9DStrengthen the opening hook,=E2=80=9D=
 =E2=80=9CAdd more specific examples in the second section,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=
=9CReduce jargon and make this accessible to non-technical readers=E2=80=9D=
): Level 6. You=E2=80=99re directing the improvement process with clear, sp=
ecific guidance.
Systematic multi-stage refinement (=E2=80=9DFirst, analyze this draft and i=
dentify the three weakest sections. Then rewrite each section using [specif=
ic framework]. Finally, check the entire piece for [specific criteria] and =
revise accordingly=E2=80=9D): Level 8. You=E2=80=99re creating a structured=
 improvement process with built-in quality checks.
Most people never progress past =E2=80=9Cmake it better.=E2=80=9D Advanced =
users treat iteration as a designed process with clear improvement criteria=
 at each stage.
Test 3: The Workflow Test
Describe your process for a common task you do regularly=E2=80=94writing re=
ports, analyzing data, creating presentations, conducting research, whateve=
r applies to your work.
Be honest. Write it down as if you=E2=80=99re explaining it to a colleague.
=E2=80=9CI ask ChatGPT/Claude=E2=80=9D: Level 2-3. You=E2=80=99re using AI,=
 but you don=E2=80=99t have a repeatable process.
=E2=80=9CI use this specific prompt pattern=E2=80=9D (and you can articulat=
e what that pattern is): Level 5-6. You=E2=80=99ve identified what works an=
d you=E2=80=99re consistent about using it.
=E2=80=9CI have a documented workflow across multiple tools=E2=80=9D (you c=
an describe specific steps, tool handoffs, and quality checks): Level 7-8. =
You=E2=80=99ve systematized your approach to the point where someone else c=
ould replicate your results.
The workflow test is the most revealing because it shows whether you=E2=80=
=99ve moved from experimentation to systematization. If you can=E2=80=99t d=
escribe a repeatable process for your most common tasks, you=E2=80=99re lea=
ving enormous value on the table.

Calculating your score will help give you clarity on where you actually sta=
nd and what to work on next. The AI will spot patterns in your approach tha=
t you might miss, so be honest!
What Your Score Actually Means
Now that you=E2=80=99ve tested yourself, let=E2=80=99s talk about what each=
 level means for your productivity and career. But remember: these interpre=
tations assume average fluency velocity. If you=E2=80=99re learning fast, y=
ou=E2=80=99ll move through these levels quickly. If you=E2=80=99re stuck, e=
ven a decent score becomes a problem.
1-3: You=E2=80=99re in the Danger Zone
You=E2=80=99re using AI, but inefficiently. You might be spending more time=
 fighting with it than it saves you. The frustration you feel is real=E2=80=
=94AI probably feels unreliable and unpredictable because you haven=E2=80=
=99t learned the patterns that make it consistent.
The gap between where you are and where a Level 6 user operates is substant=
ial. We=E2=80=99re talking about 10-15 hours per week in productive output,=
 plus the qualitative difference in what you can accomplish. But here=E2=80=
=99s the good news: the climb from 3 to 5 is very achievable. It=E2=80=99s =
mostly about building mental models and understanding how LLMs actually wor=
k.
Velocity check: If you=E2=80=99re at this level, your velocity is everythin=
g. Can you move to Level 5 in the next 8-12 weeks? If yes, you=E2=80=99re f=
ine. If you=E2=80=99ve been stuck at 2-3 for six months, that=E2=80=99s a s=
erious problem.
4-5: You=E2=80=99re Competent But Plateaued
You get genuine value from AI. You probably use it daily and can point to s=
pecific time savings. But you=E2=80=99ve hit a wall, and you might not real=
ize it.
The problem at this level is that you don=E2=80=99t know what you don=E2=80=
=99t know. You need new patterns, not just more practice. The jump from 5 t=
o 7 requires professionalizing your practice=E2=80=94building auditable pat=
terns, measuring prompt yield, creating processes teammates can use.
Most people plateau here because they assume competence means they=E2=80=99=
ve learned everything important. They haven=E2=80=99t. The productivity gap=
 between a 5 and a 7 is almost as large as the gap between a 2 and a 5.
Velocity check: How long have you been at this level? If you=E2=80=99ve bee=
n a solid 5 for six months, you=E2=80=99re coasting when you should be clim=
bing. The baseline is shifting=E2=80=94by mid-2025, a 5 will be table stake=
s, not competitive advantage.
6-7: You=E2=80=99re Building Competitive Advantage
You=E2=80=99re systematically faster than your peers. You have repeatable p=
rocesses for common tasks. You=E2=80=99re starting to see the strategic pos=
sibilities=E2=80=94not just =E2=80=9CAI can help me write faster=E2=80=9D b=
ut =E2=80=9CAI can let me tackle projects I couldn=E2=80=99t attempt before=
=2E=E2=80=9D
At this level, you=E2=80=99re probably teaching others or at least fielding=
 questions from colleagues about how you=E2=80=99re so productive. The chal=
lenge now is systematization. Can you document your workflows well enough t=
hat others could replicate them? Can you design processes that work reliabl=
y across different contexts?
Velocity check: If you=E2=80=99re still climbing (moving from 6 toward 8), =
you=E2=80=99re in great shape. If you=E2=80=99ve been at 6-7 for a year, yo=
u=E2=80=99ve stopped learning. That=E2=80=99s dangerous because the people =
behind you are catching up while AI capabilities race ahead.
8-10: You=E2=80=99re Creating Leverage
You=E2=80=99re using AI to accomplish work that seems impossible to others.=
 You=E2=80=99re not just writing better prompts=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re desi=
gning systems. You might be building custom GPTs, creating prompt libraries=
, or developing workflows that combine multiple tools in sophisticated ways=
=2E
At Level 9-10, you=E2=80=99re probably teaching others systematically, buil=
ding tools, or solving novel problems that define new use cases. This level=
 is less about personal productivity and more about multiplying impact thro=
ugh systems and teaching.
Velocity check: At this level, velocity means staying current with rapidly =
evolving capabilities and finding novel applications. If you=E2=80=99re tea=
ching and innovating, you=E2=80=99re maintaining velocity. If you=E2=80=99r=
e just executing established patterns, you=E2=80=99re starting to plateau.
The Second Dimension: Fluency Velocity
Before we talk about improvement paths, you need to understand something cr=
itical: your current score is less important than your learning rate.
A person who=E2=80=99s a 4 out of 10 but gains a level every two months is =
in a fundamentally better position than someone who=E2=80=99s been stuck at=
 6 for a year. AI capabilities are advancing so rapidly that standing still=
 means falling behind. Your fluency velocity=E2=80=94how quickly you can pi=
ck up new concepts and integrate new techniques=E2=80=94matters more than y=
our snapshot score.
Here=E2=80=99s how to assess your velocity:
Can you learn new AI concepts using AI itself? When a new technique or tool=
 emerges, do you use Claude or ChatGPT to understand it, experiment with it=
, and integrate it into your workflows? This meta-skill=E2=80=94using AI to=
 accelerate your AI learning=E2=80=94is the clearest predictor of future co=
mpetence.
How long does it take you to master a new prompting pattern? When you encou=
nter a new framework or technique, can you internalize it and apply it reli=
ably within days? Or does it take weeks of inconsistent practice?
Do you have a systematic approach to learning? When you discover a better w=
ay to do something, do you document it, practice it deliberately, and repla=
ce your old method? Or do you keep doing things the way you=E2=80=99ve alwa=
ys done them?
Your fluency velocity determines your trajectory. Someone with high velocit=
y at Level 4 will blow past someone with low velocity at Level 6 within mon=
ths. And as AI capabilities accelerate, velocity matters more each quarter.
Now let=E2=80=99s talk about how to move up=E2=80=94and more importantly, h=
ow to accelerate your learning rate while you do it.
How to Actually Improve (yes there=E2=80=99s a prompt)
I built a whole prompt to help with this, plus I have some specific pointer=
s per level below to give you a general idea of how to improve.
The prompt below is designed to do what most people can=E2=80=99t do for th=
emselves: build a personalized 90-day development plan. But it only works i=
f you=E2=80=99re honest about your actual performance, not your aspirationa=
l version.

And for extra color below, I=E2=80=99m including a set of instructor notes =
on what it looks like to level up at each stage, so you get a sense of what=
=E2=80=99s in the box.=20
From 3 to 5: Build Mental Models
The jump from 3 to 5 isn=E2=80=99t about memorizing frameworks. It=E2=80=99=
s about understanding how LLMs actually work so you can reason about what w=
ill work and what won=E2=80=99t.
Understand inference and prediction. LLMs don=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Cknow=E2=80=
=9D things=E2=80=94they predict the most likely next token based on pattern=
s in training data. This changes everything about how you prompt. When you =
ask =E2=80=9CWhat is the capital of France?=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99re not que=
rying a database. You=E2=80=99re triggering a pattern completion. When you =
understand this, you start thinking about prompts differently: you=E2=80=99=
re setting up contexts that make the desired output the most likely complet=
ion.
Grasp context windows and retrieval. Most people think AI =E2=80=9Cremember=
s=E2=80=9D your conversation. It doesn=E2=80=99t. Every response is generat=
ed from a fixed context window=E2=80=94the previous messages in your conver=
sation up to a token limit. When you understand this, you stop assuming AI =
knows what you talked about twenty messages ago. You start explicitly refer=
encing important context. You understand why breaking complex tasks into st=
ages with clear context handoffs produces better results than one giant pro=
mpt.
Learn to work backwards from outcomes. Stop starting with =E2=80=9Cwhat sho=
uld I tell the AI?=E2=80=9D Start with =E2=80=9Cwhat output do I need?=E2=
=80=9D Then work backwards: what would make that output the most likely com=
pletion? What context, examples, constraints, and format specifications wou=
ld steer the model toward that outcome? This is outcome-oriented prompting,=
 and it=E2=80=99s the difference between random success and predictable res=
ults.
Understand search versus generation. When should AI search your documents (=
RAG, retrieval augmented generation) versus generate from its training? Whe=
n do you need current information that requires real-time web search versus=
 knowledge the model already has? Understanding this distinction means you =
stop asking Claude to =E2=80=9Csearch the web=E2=80=9D and start using tool=
s designed for retrieval when that=E2=80=99s what you need.
These aren=E2=80=99t frameworks to memorize. They=E2=80=99re mental models =
that change how you think about prompting. Once you understand how LLMs gen=
erate text, you can reason about what will work instead of guessing.
The meta-skill: Use AI to learn this. Ask Claude to explain inference with =
examples. Have it show you how context windows affect output. Request demon=
strations of outcome-oriented prompting. The fastest way to build these men=
tal models is to use AI to teach you about AI=E2=80=94which also accelerate=
s your fluency velocity.
From 5 to 7: Professionalize Your Practice
You understand how AI works. Now you need to work like a professional, not =
an enthusiast. The gap between 5 and 7 is systematization.
Think in auditable patterns. A professional process is one you can explain,=
 document, and repeat. You need to move from =E2=80=9CI usually do somethin=
g like this=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9CHere is the exact sequence I follow.=E2=80=
=9D This means: documented prompts, clear stages, explicit validation crite=
ria, predictable outcomes. Build processes you could hand to a colleague an=
d have them replicate your results.
Measure prompt yield. Prompt yield is quality output per unit of prompting =
effort. A low-yield approach might take 10 iterations and 30 minutes to get=
 usable output. A high-yield approach gets you 90% of the way there in 2 pr=
ompts and 5 minutes. Start tracking this. Which prompts consistently produc=
e good first-draft output? Which require extensive iteration? Optimize for =
yield by studying what works and eliminating what doesn=E2=80=99t.
Build for your teammates, not just yourself. The shift from 5 to 7 is movin=
g from personal productivity to team capability. Can you create prompts oth=
ers can use? Can you document workflows a colleague could follow? When you =
think about uplifting teammates, you=E2=80=99re forced to make your implici=
t knowledge explicit. You build better systems because you have to explain =
them.
Create feedback loops. Professional practice requires measurement. How do y=
ou know if your prompt improvements are working? How do you validate that y=
our documented workflow produces consistent results? Build quality checks i=
nto every stage. Test edge cases. Document failure modes and how to handle =
them. This is how you move from =E2=80=9Cit usually works=E2=80=9D to =E2=
=80=9Cit reliably works.=E2=80=9D
Develop prompt libraries with versioning. Stop recreating prompts from memo=
ry. Build a library of tested, proven prompts for common tasks. Version the=
m as you improve them. Document what each version changed and why. Track su=
ccess rates. This is professional craft=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re building too=
ls you can rely on.
The jump from 5 to 7 is about treating AI work like professional work: docu=
mented, auditable, measurable, improvable, and transferable to others.
From 7 to 9: Teach and Innovate
At this level, improvement comes from two activities: teaching others and s=
olving novel problems.
Teaching forces clarity and reveals gaps. When you document a workflow for =
someone else to use, you discover all the implicit knowledge you=E2=80=99ve=
 been relying on. When you train a teammate, their questions expose holes i=
n your process. Teaching makes you better because it forces you to articula=
te what you know and refine what doesn=E2=80=99t quite work.
Design systems for scale. Move beyond personal workflows to team systems. B=
uild custom GPTs or Claude Projects with instructions others can use. Creat=
e prompt libraries your organization can adopt. Develop quality standards a=
nd evaluation criteria that work across people and contexts. This level is =
about leverage through systems.
Solve problems that seem impossible. Take on tasks where the obvious AI app=
roach doesn=E2=80=99t work. This forces innovation=E2=80=94combining techni=
ques in new ways, orchestrating multi-tool workflows, developing novel appl=
ications. You learn more from one hard problem than from ten routine tasks.
Use AI to accelerate others=E2=80=99 learning. Design onboarding processes =
that use AI to teach AI skills. Create self-service resources that let peop=
le level up without you. Your impact shifts from personal productivity to o=
rganizational capability.
The move from 7 to 9 isn=E2=80=99t about frameworks. It=E2=80=99s about dev=
eloping deep expertise through teaching, building scalable systems, and pus=
hing boundaries.

The Competitive Reality
Here=E2=80=99s what matters most: The baseline is shifting, and it=E2=80=99=
s shifting fast. Being a 5 out of 10 at AI fluency won=E2=80=99t be enough =
by late 2025 or early 2026. As these skills become table stakes in knowledg=
e work, the competitive threshold will rise to 6 or 7.
But here=E2=80=99s the more important insight: your current score matters l=
ess than your fluency velocity. A person at Level 4 who=E2=80=99s climbing =
fast will surpass a stagnant Level 6 within months. And with AI capabilitie=
s advancing this rapidly, standing still means falling behind.
The people who win aren=E2=80=99t necessarily the ones with the highest sco=
res today. They=E2=80=99re the ones who are learning fastest=E2=80=94who ca=
n integrate new techniques within days, who use AI to accelerate their AI l=
earning, who systematically improve their workflows instead of repeating th=
e same patterns.
They=E2=80=99re developing mental models that let them reason about new cap=
abilities. They=E2=80=99re building auditable processes that compound. They=
=E2=80=99re teaching others, which forces clarity and reveals gaps. They=E2=
=80=99re solving novel problems that push boundaries.
This isn=E2=80=99t about staying ahead of AI. It=E2=80=99s about staying ah=
ead of other people who are learning to use AI effectively. And those peopl=
e are moving faster than you think.
You now know where you stand, what separates each level, and how to assess =
whether you=E2=80=99re climbing or coasting. You have the mental models for=
 building understanding, the frameworks for professionalizing your practice=
, and the path to systematic improvement.
