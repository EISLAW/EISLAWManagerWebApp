WHAT TARIFFS MEAN FOR BRAZIL [3]
ITS RESPONSE WILL BE SHAPED BY DOMESTIC NEEDS.
BY: ALLISON FEDIRKA
Brazil would seem an unlikely target for the Trump administration’s tariff wars. As the 15th largest trade partner of the United States, Brazil accounts for just 2.5 percent of total U.S. exports
and 1.3 percent of total U.S. imports. Of all America’s bilateral trade relationships, the one with Brazil yields the fourth largest trade surplus – $4.5 billion in the first half of this year
alone. Yet the 50 percent tariffs Brazilian goods face as they enter the U.S. are some of the highest any country has faced under new Trump initiatives. This development reflects Washington’s
interest in reducing competition for key sectors of the U.S. economy and preserving its vision for the global economy. For Brazil, the tariffs may have far-reaching consequences on economic
development and its future trade.
[U.S.-Brazil Trade] [4]

Political and ideological rhetoric has obscured U.S. motives and rationale for targeting Brazilian trade. In July, the U.S. trade representative began a "Section 301" investigation into Brazil’s
treatment of U.S. companies and trade practices over concerns they hurt U.S. companies, workers, farmers and technology leaders. Later that month, the Trump administration raised tariffs on Brazil
from 10 percent to 50 percent – the stated justification for which involved protecting freedom of speech, ensuring national security, fighting corruption, preserving forests and opposing political
persecution. The latter point concerns a supreme court ruling against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a known Trump ally who has been charged with helping to instigate a coup a week after
the new president’s inauguration.
A closer look at the areas under investigation, however, shows that U.S. interests are more aligned with gaining an economic edge rather than with protecting American values abroad. The probe targets
digital trade and electronic payment services, intellectual property protections, ethanol and illegal deforestation. U.S. social media companies – namely X and Meta – have recently come under
scrutiny in Brazil because they were used to organize social unrest and violent incidents. Last year, Brazilian authorities temporarily suspended X's operations in the country after the company
refused to comply with Brazilian law, requiring the company to maintain a representative in the country and pay court-imposed fines. Earlier this year, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes
reminded social media companies that their continued operation in Brazil depends on complying with Brazilian law. Moreover, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has endorsed congressional efforts to
increase oversight of social media content, with the intent of breaking the concentration of power on digital platforms and preventing the dissemination of hate speech, misinformation and fake news.
Washington also feels threatened by the introduction of new digital trade and payment platforms in Brazil. Its investigation indirectly references Pix, an electronic payment service developed by the
government that is now used by roughly 75 percent of consumers and businesses in Brazil. The government has also supported efforts to use local currencies for international payments and technologies
like blockchain to cut transaction costs. These moves compromise the interests of several tech companies that play a major role in the U.S. economy and whose CEOs – Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff
Bezos and Peter Thiel – have ties to President Donald Trump.
Other things the U.S. seeks to protect include the pharmaceutical industry, corn farmers, cattle ranchers and other agricultural workers. These interests play an important role in the U.S. economy and
have offered strong political support for Trump in the past. The main complaint from pharmaceutical companies is the length of time required to get a patent for products in Brazil and the availability
of related data. As for corn, the U.S. and Brazil are among the world’s top producers and consumers of ethanol. While U.S. ethanol primarily utilizes corn, Brazil uses corn and/or sugar in ethanol
production (depending on which crop yields a better price point). Brazil currently places an 18 percent tariff on corn-based ethanol imports, putting U.S. producers at a disadvantage in the large
Brazilian market. Illegal deforestation is not about environmental concerns but rather beef production, another area in which the U.S. and Brazil compete in global markets. The need for more grazing
pastures and cattle (and agricultural crops more generally) is a major driver behind deforestation activities in Brazil.
Equally notable are the products the U.S. exempted from its new raft of tariffs. Many of them were selected to avoid direct impact on the U.S. economy. Hydrocarbons and semi-finished products and
primary forms of iron are, by value, some of the leading Brazilian exports to U.S. markets. Energy, certain types of iron, certain types of steel and metallurgical‐grade alumina were all exempted.
(Steel and aluminum still face the 25 percent general tariff applied across all countries.) Fertilizers were spared thanks to their role in agricultural production. Similarly, precious metals, tin ore
and certain types of silicon metals did not get higher tariffs because of their role in chemical and tech production.

Brazil initially tried to keep a low profile and preemptively reach agreements with the U.S. to avoid a trade war. Brazilian officials like Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira and special adviser Celso
Amorim reached out to the Trump administration prior to its return to office. From January to mid-April of this year, the Brazilian government held seven rounds of discussions with the U.S. trade
representative and other officials. Rather than take an absolute view of no tariffs on Brazilian goods, Brasilia advocated a quota system for Brazilian exports such as sugar and steel, in tandem with
proposals to increase or introduce quotas for U.S. beef and ethanol entering the Brazilian market. It’s notable that the talks were conducted at the government-to-government level rather than by
sector representatives. Vice President and Minister of Development, Industry, Trade and Services Geraldo Alckmin regularly promoted bilateral trade in areas the U.S. deemed strategic: artificial
intelligence, critical minerals, infrastructure, information technology and semiconductors.
These efforts failed, of course, so Brasilia is now exploring other response options. As a precautionary measure, the Brazilian government preemptively drafted and passed a trade reciprocity law,
giving it the power to adopt trade measures against countries that impose unilateral barriers on Brazilian goods. There is also talk of the creation of special funds to support exporters hurt by the
new tariffs. More confrontational responses have been submitted, including the possibility of taxing select companies (like big tech) or suspending patents granted to U.S. holders. Indirect responses
also appear to be in the works. Justice Moraes opened an investigation into foreign exchange transactions and suspected insider trading after a large volume of Brazilian reais were sold prior to
Trump’s announcement of tariffs against Brazil. Some media reports suggest U.S. lawyers and firms have argued that Trump is overstepping his powers.
Ultimately, how Brazil responds to the tariffs will be shaped by its domestic economic needs and its other trade relationships. The country has been trying to revitalize its economy for years.
Increasing exports and making Brazilian industry more competitive are two parts of that effort. From 2014 to 2024, Brazilian exports as a percentage of GDP rose from 11 percent to 18 percent. Even so,
much of these exports consist of raw materials, not higher-value-added goods. In this sense, one of the more damaging aspects of U.S. tariffs is the fact that the U.S. is the primary market for
Brazilian manufactured goods, accounting for 17.4 percent of industrial exports last year. To make its goods more competitive on the global market, the government has spearheaded several initiatives
meant to reduce logistical costs and facilitate tax reforms, investment and domestic production of critical defense technologies such as satellites and radars. Growing tension with U.S. tech
companies, heightened awareness of potential IP violations and the general uncertainty over the bilateral business climate will make U.S. investors and companies think twice before putting their money
into the areas Brazil seeks to promote and grow.
What complicates the tariff situation is that Brazil sits squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war and the brewing spat between the U.S. and the BRICS countries. China has traditionally
turned to Brazil as an alternate source of agricultural products and a market for its steel when the U.S. has closed Chinese access to its markets. True to form, China has again turned to Brazil for
agricultural goods. China is also making a concerted effort to woo Brazil by promoting a bioceanic railway that could give Brazil access to the Pacific and by increasing its participation in mergers
and acquisitions with a focus on logistics, energy, mining, technology and data infrastructure. Chinese companies have also pledged more investments in Brazilian agriculture.

These advantages come at a cost. As a result of the U.S.-China trade war, China has dumped steel into Brazilian markets and applied upward pressure on domestic food prices as China increases its
demand for beef, pork and poultry from Brazilian suppliers. More, the Intelligence Authorization Act under consideration by the U.S. Congress calls for a closer examination of Chinese ties to
Brazilian agriculture, from government relations to joint venture ownership to roles in supply chains and impacts on global markets. Essentially, this puts another target on Brazil.
Brazil’s vision for the global economy differs from that of the U.S., and this divergence has fueled disagreements between the U.S. and BRICS countries. Brazil seeks a multilateral framework for the
world economic order and strongly advocates the use of local currencies in global trade. This runs in stark contrast to the U.S., which wants to preserve the status of the dollar in commodity pricing
and international trade. Trump even threatened up to 100 percent tariffs on BRICS products if the group pursued a common currency. This kind of threat is very unlikely to materialize in anything
concrete, but there is no denying that the main targets of the U.S. trade war – China and Russia – along with the countries facing the highest tariff rates – India and Brazil – are all members
of BRICS. One explanation for this is that the U.S. is trying to pressure India and Brazil – countries with which it usually has good ties – into helping cut off Russian and Chinese economies from
external lifelines. This reflects a U.S. desire to exert some control over the global economy while also trying to be more inward-looking.
Whatever Brazil decides to do, its response will change its trade relationships outside the U.S. and China. The pressure on Brazilian exports further incentivizes the government to quickly and
effectively execute domestic reforms that will boost the competitiveness of Brazilian exports, prop up local industry and support the development of technology and other advanced economic sectors.
Brazil is also looking to improve its trade ties with various partners such as Mexico, India, Canada, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. This degree of diversification may also help Brazil remove
itself from the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade war. According to the Global Business Center at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a Sao Paulo-based university and think tank, only 13 percent of Brazilian
exports are covered by trade agreements. This is significantly lower than the 60 percent figure observed in most other countries. The pressure to gain access to foreign markets will inspire Brasilia
to open trade talks while putting pressure on Mercosur, the trading bloc whose membership has constrained Brazil’s ability to independently sign free trade agreements with other countries. It’s
clear that questions remain over the future of the U.S.-Brazil trade conflict – perhaps none more important than how Brazil will engage with global markets going forward.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Brazil would seem =
an unlikely target for the Trump administration=E2=80=99s tariff wars. As t=
he 15th largest trade partner of the United States, Brazil accounts for jus=
t 2.5 percent of total U.S. exports and 1.3 percent of total U.S. imports. =
Of all America=E2=80=99s bilateral trade relationships, the one with Brazil=
 yields the fourth largest trade surplus =E2=80=93 $4.5 billion in the firs=
t half of this year alone. Yet the 50 percent tariffs Brazilian goods face =
as they enter the U.S. are some of the highest any country has faced under =
new Trump initiatives. This development reflects Washington=E2=80=99s inter=
est in reducing competition for key sectors of the U.S. economy and preserv=
ing its vision for the global economy. For Brazil, the tariffs may have far=
-reaching consequences on economic development and its future trade.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Political and ideo=
logical rhetoric has obscured U.S. motives and rationale for targeting Braz=
ilian trade. In July, the U.S. trade representative began a &quot;Section 3=
01&quot; investigation into Brazil=E2=80=99s treatment of U.S. companies an=
d trade practices over concerns they hurt U.S. companies, workers, farmers =
and technology leaders. Later that month, the Trump administration raised t=
ariffs on Brazil from 10 percent to 50 percent =E2=80=93 the stated justifi=
cation for which involved protecting freedom of speech, ensuring national s=
ecurity, fighting corruption, preserving forests and opposing political per=
secution. The latter point concerns a supreme court ruling against former B=
razilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a known Trump ally who has been charged =
with helping to instigate a coup a week after the new president=E2=80=99s i=
nauguration.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A closer look at t=
he areas under investigation, however, shows that U.S. interests are more a=
ligned with gaining an economic edge rather than with protecting American v=
alues abroad. The probe targets digital trade and electronic payment servic=
es, intellectual property protections, ethanol and illegal deforestation. U=
.S. social media companies =E2=80=93 namely X and Meta =E2=80=93 have recen=
tly come under scrutiny in Brazil because they were used to organize social=
 unrest and violent incidents. Last year, Brazilian authorities temporarily=
 suspended X's operations in the country after the company refused to compl=
y with Brazilian law, requiring the company to maintain a representative in=
 the country and pay court-imposed fines. Earlier this year, Supreme Court =
Justice Alexandre de Moraes reminded social media companies that their cont=
inued operation in Brazil depends on complying with Brazilian law. Moreover=
, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has endorsed congressional efforts to=
 increase oversight of social media content, with the intent of breaking th=
e concentration of power on digital platforms and preventing the disseminat=
ion of hate speech, misinformation and fake news.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington also fe=
els threatened by the introduction of new digital trade and payment platfor=
ms in Brazil. Its investigation indirectly references Pix, an electronic pa=
yment service developed by the government that is now used by roughly 75 pe=
rcent of consumers and businesses in Brazil. The government has also suppor=
ted efforts to use local currencies for international payments and technolo=
gies like blockchain to cut transaction costs. These moves compromise the i=
nterests of several tech companies that play a major role in the U.S. econo=
my and whose CEOs =E2=80=93 Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Pete=
r Thiel =E2=80=93 have ties to President Donald Trump.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Other things the U=
.S. seeks to protect include the pharmaceutical industry, corn farmers, cat=
tle ranchers and other agricultural workers. These interests play an import=
ant role in the U.S. economy and have offered strong political support for =
Trump in the past. The main complaint from pharmaceutical companies is the =
length of time required to get a patent for products in Brazil and the avai=
lability of related data. As for corn, the U.S. and Brazil are among the wo=
rld=E2=80=99s top producers and consumers of ethanol. While U.S. ethanol pr=
imarily utilizes corn, Brazil uses corn and/or sugar in ethanol production =
(depending on which crop yields a better price point). Brazil currently pla=
ces an 18 percent tariff on corn-based ethanol imports, putting U.S. produc=
ers at a disadvantage in the large Brazilian market. Illegal deforestation =
is not about environmental concerns but rather beef production, another are=
a in which the U.S. and Brazil compete in global markets. The need for more=
 grazing pastures and cattle (and agricultural crops more generally) is a m=
ajor driver behind deforestation activities in Brazil.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Equally notable ar=
e the products the U.S. exempted from its new raft of tariffs. Many of them=
 were selected to avoid direct impact on the U.S. economy. Hydrocarbons and=
 semi-finished products and primary forms of iron are, by value, some of th=
e leading Brazilian exports to U.S. markets. Energy, certain types of iron,=
 certain types of steel and metallurgical=E2=80=90grade alumina were all ex=
empted. (Steel and aluminum still face the 25 percent general tariff applie=
d across all countries.) Fertilizers were spared thanks to their role in ag=
ricultural production. Similarly, precious metals, tin ore and certain type=
s of silicon metals did not get higher tariffs because of their role in che=
mical and tech production.</p>

/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Brazil initially t=
ried to keep a low profile and preemptively reach agreements with the U.S. =
to avoid a trade war. Brazilian officials like Foreign Minister Mauro Vieir=
a and special adviser Celso Amorim reached out to the Trump administration =
prior to its return to office. From January to mid-April of this year, the =
Brazilian government held seven rounds of discussions with the U.S. trade r=
epresentative and other officials. Rather than take an absolute view of no =
tariffs on Brazilian goods, Brasilia advocated a quota system for Brazilian=
 exports such as sugar and steel, in tandem with proposals to increase or i=
ntroduce quotas for U.S. beef and ethanol entering the Brazilian market. It=
=E2=80=99s notable that the talks were conducted at the government-to-gover=
nment level rather than by sector representatives. Vice President and Minis=
ter of Development, Industry, Trade and Services Geraldo Alckmin regularly =
promoted bilateral trade in areas the U.S. deemed strategic: artificial int=
elligence, critical minerals, infrastructure, information technology and se=
miconductors.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These efforts fail=
ed, of course, so Brasilia is now exploring other response options. As a pr=
ecautionary measure, the Brazilian government preemptively drafted and pass=
ed a trade reciprocity law, giving it the power to adopt trade measures aga=
inst countries that impose unilateral barriers on Brazilian goods. There is=
 also talk of the creation of special funds to support exporters hurt by th=
e new tariffs. More confrontational responses have been submitted, includin=
g the possibility of taxing select companies (like big tech) or suspending =
patents granted to U.S. holders. Indirect responses also appear to be in th=
e works. Justice Moraes opened an investigation into foreign exchange trans=
actions and suspected insider trading after a large volume of Brazilian rea=
is were sold prior to Trump=E2=80=99s announcement of tariffs against Brazi=
l. Some media reports suggest U.S. lawyers and firms have argued that Trump=
 is overstepping his powers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Ultimately, how Br=
azil responds to the tariffs will be shaped by its domestic economic needs =
and its other trade relationships. The country has been trying to revitaliz=
e its economy for years. Increasing exports and making Brazilian industry m=
ore competitive are two parts of that effort. From 2014 to 2024, Brazilian =
exports as a percentage of GDP rose from 11 percent to 18 percent. Even so,=
 much of these exports consist of raw materials, not higher-value-added goo=
ds. In this sense, one of the more damaging aspects of U.S. tariffs is the =
fact that the U.S. is the primary market for Brazilian manufactured goods, =
accounting for 17.4 percent of industrial exports last year. To make its go=
ods more competitive on the global market, the government has spearheaded s=
everal initiatives meant to reduce logistical costs and facilitate tax refo=
rms, investment and domestic production of critical defense technologies su=
ch as satellites and radars. Growing tension with U.S. tech companies, heig=
htened awareness of potential IP violations and the general uncertainty ove=
r the bilateral business climate will make U.S. investors and companies thi=
nk twice before putting their money into the areas Brazil seeks to promote =
and grow.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">What complicates t=
he tariff situation is that Brazil sits squarely in the middle of the U.S.-=
China trade war and the brewing spat between the U.S. and the BRICS countri=
es. China has traditionally turned to Brazil as an alternate source of agri=
cultural products and a market for its steel when the U.S. has closed Chine=
se access to its markets. True to form, China has again turned to Brazil fo=
r agricultural goods. China is also making a concerted effort to woo Brazil=
 by promoting a bioceanic railway that could give Brazil access to the Paci=
fic and by increasing its participation in mergers and acquisitions with a =
focus on logistics, energy, mining, technology and data infrastructure. Chi=
nese companies have also pledged more investments in Brazilian agriculture.=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These advantages c=
ome at a cost. As a result of the U.S.-China trade war, China has dumped st=
eel into Brazilian markets and applied upward pressure on domestic food pri=
ces as China increases its demand for beef, pork and poultry from Brazilian=
 suppliers. More, the Intelligence Authorization Act under consideration by=
 the U.S. Congress calls for a closer examination of Chinese ties to Brazil=
ian agriculture, from government relations to joint venture ownership to ro=
les in supply chains and impacts on global markets. Essentially, this puts =
another target on Brazil.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Brazil=E2=80=99s v=
ision for the global economy differs from that of the U.S., and this diverg=
ence has fueled disagreements between the U.S. and BRICS countries. Brazil =
seeks a multilateral framework for the world economic order and strongly ad=
vocates the use of local currencies in global trade. This runs in stark con=
trast to the U.S., which wants to preserve the status of the dollar in comm=
odity pricing and international trade. Trump even threatened up to 100 perc=
ent tariffs on BRICS products if the group pursued a common currency. This =
kind of threat is very unlikely to materialize in anything concrete, but th=
ere is no denying that the main targets of the U.S. trade war =E2=80=93 Chi=
na and Russia =E2=80=93 along with the countries facing the highest tariff =
rates =E2=80=93 India and Brazil =E2=80=93 are all members of BRICS. One ex=
planation for this is that the U.S. is trying to pressure India and Brazil =
=E2=80=93 countries with which it usually has good ties =E2=80=93 into help=
ing cut off Russian and Chinese economies from external lifelines. This ref=
lects a U.S. desire to exert some control over the global economy while als=
o trying to be more inward-looking.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Whatever Brazil de=
cides to do, its response will change its trade relationships outside the U=
.S. and China. The pressure on Brazilian exports further incentivizes the g=
overnment to quickly and effectively execute domestic reforms that will boo=
st the competitiveness of Brazilian exports, prop up local industry and sup=
port the development of technology and other advanced economic sectors. Bra=
zil is also looking to improve its trade ties with various partners such as=
 Mexico, India, Canada, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. This degree of =
diversification may also help Brazil remove itself from the crosshairs of t=
he U.S.-China trade war. According to the Global Business Center at Fundaca=
o Getulio Vargas, a Sao Paulo-based university and think tank, only 13 perc=
ent of Brazilian exports are covered by trade agreements. This is significa=
ntly lower than the 60 percent figure observed in most other countries. The=
 pressure to gain access to foreign markets will inspire Brasilia to open t=
rade talks while putting pressure on Mercosur, the trading bloc whose membe=
rship has constrained Brazil=E2=80=99s ability to independently sign free t=
rade agreements with other countries. It=E2=80=99s clear that questions rem=
ain over the future of the U.S.-Brazil trade conflict =E2=80=93 perhaps non=
e more important than how Brazil will engage with global markets going forw=
ard.</p>
