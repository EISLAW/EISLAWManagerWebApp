RUSSIA’S DETERIORATING INTERNAL SECURITY [3]
THE ASSASSINATIONS OF TWO GENERALS HAVE RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS AMONG THE RULING ELITE.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
On April 25, a lieutenant general in the Russian military was killed in Balashikha, a town located near Moscow. A few months earlier, the general in charge of the Russian military’s radiation,
chemical and biological defense department was also killed. The assassinations shared certain hallmarks: Both featured explosives installed in vehicles that were detonated remotely, probably through
nearby video cameras.
The timing of the second murder is particularly notable. That day, Washington’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in
the Kremlin to once again discuss the future of Ukraine. It’s not uncommon for attacks like this to take place during negotiations; one side often tries to remind the other it has leverage to
disrupt or facilitate talks as it sees fit. And indeed, the negotiations over Ukraine have yielded nothing, with neither Ukraine nor Russia interested in making immediate, meaningful concessions.
The process is complicated somewhat by internal Russian politics. Among the Russian elite, there are two unofficial camps: those who want to continue the fight, and those who want peace. Importantly,
there is no evidence to suggest that their differences of opinion are strong enough to cause a major or irreconcilable rift in the government. The advocates of peace see a resolution as a matter of
practicality. They understand the political danger in “losing” a war after so many costly years of waging one, but they simply think the return to international trade and economic stability is
more important to the government and to industry in the long run. It’s why one hears Putin and his cohorts speak regularly about their readiness for a truce, economic development and the return of
foreign investment. Peace advocates also understand the importance of minimal concessions, which explains why Putin refrained from saying Russia was ready to negotiate until after the military secured
Kursk.
The pro-war camp, which includes Dmitry Medvedev, Sergey Shoigu and Ramzan Kadyrov, wants to continue fighting until Russia can achieve a military victory. This faction notes that no truce reached by
negotiation will eliminate the root causes of the war and, if anything, would benefit Ukraine and NATO. They believe that the victory in Kursk and the divisions in the West over its support for
Ukraine will ultimately lead to triumphs on the battlefield. In contrast with the pro-peace camp, which explicitly rules out future conflict with NATO, the pro-war group publicly says that it does not
trust the United States and that European countries are already actively preparing for conflict with Russia.
The division among the Russian elite mirrors the division of the Russian public. According to polls conducted by the Levada Center, more than half of all respondents are in favor of negotiations,
while a third are in favor of continued military action. Yet a solid majority believes the idea of concessions is unacceptable.
The disagreements among the elite have led to speculation that one of the factions is responsible for the deaths of the generals. However, this doesn’t stand up to any scrutiny. Russian authorities
historically haven’t dealt with internal opposition this way. They prefer to imprison them or reassign them to a position in which they can’t cause any trouble. For example, last year Putin
appointed an economist named Andrey Belousov to replace Shoigu as defense minister. The reason for the reshuffle is still widely debated – some say it was a run-of-the-mill power struggle, while
others argue it was punishment for the military’s shoddy performance in the early stages of the war in Ukraine. Either way, Shoigu wasn’t killed for his tactical disagreements with Putin; he was
merely given a less powerful position as secretary of the Security Council.
Other examples abound. Maj. Gen. Ivan Popov was removed from command in 2023 after reporting on problems in the army. He was sentenced to five years in a penal colony on allegations of fraud and
corruption. Former Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov was accused of bribery and embezzlement (although there were also suggestions Ivanov was suspected of treason), as was former Lt. Gen. Yuri
Kuznetsov. Both were Shoigu loyalists. In no instance were any of these people murdered under a false flag terrorist attack. It is simply not a tool the Russian government uses for this purpose.
Moreover, Moscow is on record as saying terrorist threats over the past few years are due to Ukrainian efforts to sabotage and undermine the country. Shoigu himself recently warned of possible
assassination attempts. Russian law enforcement agencies believe the attacks last week and in December were carried out by order of the Ukrainian security services. According to the Russian
government, Ukraine suspected Igor Kirillov, the general killed in December, of sanctioning the use of chemical weapons. Yaroslav Moskalik, the man killed last week, was a non-public but important
figure in the Defense Ministry. In 2015, he was a member of the Russian contact group to resolve the situation in southeastern Ukraine, and recently, he helped prepare proposals meant to increase the
combat capabilities of Russian troops, organize the development of a national defense plan, and plan strategic and operational protocol. In other words, he was in charge of a lot of important
information related to the command of the troops. He was known as an intelligent, thorough and demanding officer, and there were rumors that he was being considered to head the National Defense
Management Center. During interrogation, the suspects in Kirillov's murder confirmed the involvement of the Ukrainian security services, who allegedly promised to pay $100,000 for the murder of the
general and to organize their departure from Russia to Europe. According to the FSB, an agent of the Ukrainian security services was also involved in the murder of Moskalik.
Even if this version of events is true, the involvement of external forces in this terrorist attack doesn’t make things any easier for the Kremlin, which tries to project an image of strength in any
situation. The murder of two generals in six months has thus become a litmus test for Russia’s security apparatus. The events show that despite personnel changes and successes on the warfront,
Russia remains vulnerable internally. And the fact that both attacks appear to have been well planned testifies to the fact that inside Russia, there are viable and extensive underground networks
controlled from outside – networks that Moscow either doesn’t know about or has a hard time tracking.
This could be due at least partly to personnel problems. By the end of 2024, the personnel shortage at the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs had climbed to 174,000 – nearly 20 more than usual.
The ministry lost some 3,000 people per month in 2024, ostensibly because of low salaries and inattention to law enforcement [4]. It’s certainly true that, in light of the war effort, Moscow cut the
ministry’s budget in 2024.
Russia’s internal security is tied, rightly or wrongly, to the war in Ukraine. Commenting on the death of Moskalik, a retired general criticized the government by saying the generals on whom the
results in Ukraine and the lives of thousands of soldiers depend continue to die due to insufficient protection. To rectify the problem, Moscow will have to either achieve peace faster or again shift
its focus to the war effort – both of which are difficult, given the varying opinions of the Russian elite.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On April 25, a lie=
utenant general in the Russian military was killed in Balashikha, a town lo=
cated near Moscow. A few months earlier, the general in charge of the Russi=
an military=E2=80=99s radiation, chemical and biological defense department=
 was also killed. The assassinations shared certain hallmarks: Both feature=
d explosives installed in vehicles that were detonated remotely, probably t=
hrough nearby video cameras.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The timing of the =
second murder is particularly notable. That day, Washington=E2=80=99s speci=
al envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow to meet with =
Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin to once again discuss the f=
uture of Ukraine. It=E2=80=99s not uncommon for attacks like this to take p=
lace during negotiations; one side often tries to remind the other it has l=
everage to disrupt or facilitate talks as it sees fit. And indeed, the nego=
tiations over Ukraine have yielded nothing, with neither Ukraine nor Russia=
 interested in making immediate, meaningful concessions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The process is com=
plicated somewhat by internal Russian politics. Among the Russian elite, th=
ere are two unofficial camps: those who want to continue the fight, and tho=
se who want peace. Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that their =
differences of opinion are strong enough to cause a major or irreconcilable=
 rift in the government. The advocates of peace see a resolution as a matte=
r of practicality. They understand the political danger in =E2=80=9Closing=
=E2=80=9D a war after so many costly years of waging one, but they simply t=
hink the return to international trade and economic stability is more impor=
tant to the government and to industry in the long run. It=E2=80=99s why on=
e hears Putin and his cohorts speak regularly about their readiness for a t=
ruce, economic development and the return of foreign investment. Peace advo=
cates also understand the importance of minimal concessions, which explains=
 why Putin refrained from saying Russia was ready to negotiate until after =
the military secured Kursk.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The pro-war camp, =
which includes Dmitry Medvedev, Sergey Shoigu and Ramzan Kadyrov, wants to =
continue fighting until Russia can achieve a military victory. This faction=
 notes that no truce reached by negotiation will eliminate the root causes =
of the war and, if anything, would benefit Ukraine and NATO. They believe t=
hat the victory in Kursk and the divisions in the West over its support for=
 Ukraine will ultimately lead to triumphs on the battlefield. In contrast w=
ith the pro-peace camp, which explicitly rules out future conflict with NAT=
O, the pro-war group publicly says that it does not trust the United States=
 and that European countries are already actively preparing for conflict wi=
th Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The division among=
 the Russian elite mirrors the division of the Russian public. According to=
 polls conducted by the Levada Center, more than half of all respondents ar=
e in favor of negotiations, while a third are in favor of continued militar=
y action. Yet a solid majority believes the idea of concessions is unaccept=
able.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The disagreements =
among the elite have led to speculation that one of the factions is respons=
ible for the deaths of the generals. However, this doesn=E2=80=99t stand up=
 to any scrutiny. Russian authorities historically haven=E2=80=99t dealt wi=
th internal opposition this way. They prefer to imprison them or reassign t=
hem to a position in which they can=E2=80=99t cause any trouble. For exampl=
e, last year Putin appointed an economist named Andrey Belousov to replace =
Shoigu as defense minister. The reason for the reshuffle is still widely de=
bated =E2=80=93 some say it was a run-of-the-mill power struggle, while oth=
ers argue it was punishment for the military=E2=80=99s shoddy performance i=
n the early stages of the war in Ukraine. Either way, Shoigu wasn=E2=80=99t=
 killed for his tactical disagreements with Putin; he was merely given a le=
ss powerful position as secretary of the Security Council.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Other examples abo=
und. Maj. Gen. Ivan Popov was removed from command in 2023 after reporting =
on problems in the army. He was sentenced to five years in a penal colony o=
n allegations of fraud and corruption. Former Deputy Defense Minister Timur=
 Ivanov was accused of bribery and embezzlement (although there were also s=
uggestions Ivanov was suspected of treason), as was former Lt. Gen. Yuri Ku=
znetsov. Both were Shoigu loyalists. In no instance were any of these peopl=
e murdered under a false flag terrorist attack. It is simply not a tool the=
 Russian government uses for this purpose.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Moreover, Moscow i=
s on record as saying terrorist threats over the past few years are due to =
Ukrainian efforts to sabotage and undermine the country. Shoigu himself rec=
ently warned of possible assassination attempts. Russian law enforcement ag=
encies believe the attacks last week and in December were carried out by or=
der of the Ukrainian security services. According to the Russian government=
, Ukraine suspected Igor Kirillov, the general killed in December, of sanct=
ioning the use of chemical weapons. Yaroslav Moskalik, the man killed last =
week, was a non-public but important figure in the Defense Ministry. In 201=
5, he was a member of the Russian contact group to resolve the situation in=
 southeastern Ukraine, and recently, he helped prepare proposals meant to i=
ncrease the combat capabilities of Russian troops, organize the development=
 of a national defense plan, and plan strategic and operational protocol. I=
n other words, he was in charge of a lot of important information related t=
o the command of the troops. He was known as an intelligent, thorough and d=
emanding officer, and there were rumors that he was being considered to hea=
d the National Defense Management Center. During interrogation, the suspect=
s in Kirillov's murder confirmed the involvement of the Ukrainian security =
services, who allegedly promised to pay $100,000 for the murder of the gene=
ral and to organize their departure from Russia to Europe. According to the=
 FSB, an agent of the Ukrainian security services was also involved in the =
murder of Moskalik.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Even if this versi=
on of events is true, the involvement of external forces in this terrorist =
attack doesn=E2=80=99t make things any easier for the Kremlin, which tries =
to project an image of strength in any situation. The murder of two general=
s in six months has thus become a litmus test for Russia=E2=80=99s security=
 apparatus. The events show that despite personnel changes and successes on=
 the warfront, Russia remains vulnerable internally. And the fact that both=
 attacks appear to have been well planned testifies to the fact that inside=
 Russia, there are viable and extensive underground networks controlled fro=
m outside =E2=80=93 networks that Moscow either doesn=E2=80=99t know about =
or has a hard time tracking.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This could be due =
at least partly to personnel problems. By the end of 2024, the personnel sh=
ortage at the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs had climbed to 174,000 =
=E2=80=93 nearly 20 more than usual. The ministry lost some 3,000 people pe=
r month in 2024, ostensibly because of low salaries and <a href=3D"https://=
geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/401791/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aH=

0e6ba5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px">inattention to law enforcement=
</a>. It=E2=80=99s certainly true that, in light of the war effort, Moscow =
cut the ministry=E2=80=99s budget in 2024.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia=E2=80=99s i=
nternal security is tied, rightly or wrongly, to the war in Ukraine. Commen=
ting on the death of Moskalik, a retired general criticized the government =
by saying the generals on whom the results in Ukraine and the lives of thou=
sands of soldiers depend continue to die due to insufficient protection. To=
 rectify the problem, Moscow will have to either achieve peace faster or ag=
ain shift its focus to the war effort =E2=80=93 both of which are difficult=
, given the varying opinions of the Russian elite.</p>
