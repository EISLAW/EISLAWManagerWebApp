We=E2=80=99re just one day away from the rumored release of ChatGPT-5, and =
the excitement across boardrooms, Slack channels, and AI communities is pal=
pable. There=E2=80=99s an electric feeling in the air that maybe=E2=80=94ju=
st maybe=E2=80=94this latest iteration will be the one to finally deliver o=
n every promise, to effortlessly solve our most complex challenges, and to =
magically transform our businesses overnight. It=E2=80=99s a powerful narra=
tive, seductive in its simplicity.
But there=E2=80=99s a deeper truth beneath this narrative, one I=E2=80=99ve=
 witnessed firsthand over years spent guiding Fortune 500 companies through=
 the messy reality of AI implementation. And it=E2=80=99s this: our biggest=
 AI problems were never truly about model capabilities.
With AI project abandonment rates skyrocketing=E2=80=9442% of companies now=
 scrapping the majority of their AI initiatives, up sharply from 17% just l=
ast year=E2=80=94the real issues we face aren=E2=80=99t technological; they=
=E2=80=99re human. They=E2=80=99re about executives waiting for magic rathe=
r than doing the hard, meticulous work required to build strong foundations=
=2E They=E2=80=99re about data chaos, stra=
tegy misalignment, and organization=
al inertia.
This reflection is a reality check, carefully timed as we stand on the edge=
 of another AI breakthrough. It=E2=80=99s a guide through ten critical prob=
lems no new model=E2=80=94even one as anticipated as ChatGPT-5=E2=80=94will=
 magically resolve. These truths are tough, but they=E2=80=99re essential. =
Because here=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve learned through countless meetings=
 and strategy sessions: the companies winning in AI aren=E2=80=99t just tho=
se adopting the latest model; they=E2=80=99re the ones who=E2=80=99ve confr=
onted the uncomfortable truths and done the difficult, unglamorous work of =
getting their data, strategies, and people ready.
As you prepare for what=E2=80=99s next, consider this: are you waiting for =
AI to fix problems you haven=E2=80=99t been willing to face yourself? If so=
, let this moment=E2=80=94right now, before the next hype wave hits=E2=80=
=94be the one where you shift from passive anticipation to proactive transf=
ormation. The next model release can amplify your success, but only if you=
=E2=80=99ve built something solid to amplify.
This article isn=E2=80=99t just about problems. It=E2=80=99s about clarity,=
 urgency, and finally making AI work for your business=E2=80=94not the othe=

What ChatGPT-5 Won't Fix: 10 Brutal Truths About AI's Real Problems
Executive Summary: ChatGPT-5 won't save your business from bad data, poor s=
trategy, or organizational dysfunction. After countless boardroom conversat=
ions about AI implementation, I've identified ten fundamental problems that=
 no model upgrade will solve. These aren't AI problems=E2=80=94they're huma=
n and organizational failures that cost companies millions while they wait =
for the next magical model release. 42% of companies are now abandoning mos=
t of their AI initiatives, up from 17% last year, with the average organiza=
tion scrapping 46% of AI proof-of-concepts before they reach production. Ev=
ery single one of these failures requires boring, difficult work that execu=
tives desperately want to avoid.
I don't have a time machine to preview ChatGPT-5. What I do have is years o=
f boardroom experience watching companies fumble AI implementation while pr=
aying for technological salvation.
Here's the uncomfortable truth: most AI failures have nothing to do with mo=
del capabilities. They're boring, predictable organizational failures that =
executives refuse to acknowledge. The model makers want you to believe thei=
r next release will transform your business. They leak breathless updates a=
bout reasoning capabilities and benchmark scores. Meanwhile, estimates for =
AI project failure rates are consistently high, ranging from 70% to 85%=E2=
=80=94more than 80 percent of AI projects fail, twice the rate of failure o=
f information technology projects that do not involve AI.
When the model makers make these big claims about how incredible their new =
models are, I filter them through actual organizational realities. I want t=
o walk you through ten specific problem areas with boring solutions that I =
see over and over again=E2=80=94problems that ChatGPT-5 will not magically =
fix.
1. Magic Wand Thinking About Your Data
This is the single biggest failure I see. Over and over again, executives l=
abor under the delusion: "We'll just give our data to the LLM and it will f=
ix it." They're on Azure cloud using Copilot. They're using Gemini. They're=
 using ChatGPT. Doesn't matter. They think the model will somehow transform=
 their data chaos into insight.
No. It will not fix it.
The numbers don't lie: 78% of firms that struggle with AI point to data rea=
diness as the root cause. Data readiness is not something an LLM will magic=
ally solve. Gartner predicts that through 2025, at least 50% of generative =
AI projects will be abandoned at the pilot stage due to poor data quality, =
among other factors.
There's a school of thought on the research side that eventually AI will be=
come so sophisticated it can parse massive, messy human data with huge cont=
ext windows and just make sense of everything. This gets voiced as if it's =
available today. It's not. And even if it becomes possible, feeding AI garb=
age data remains organizational malpractice.
I've been in situations where people describe their data problems while sho=
wing me data with zero semantic meaning to an LLM. It's just an undifferent=
iated blob=E2=80=94uncategorized, unorganized. Thousands and thousands of d=
ocuments with no structure. You haven't given the model any sense of semant=
ic meaning in the larger data structures. You have no sub-corpus semantic s=
tructures to work with.
The IHL Group research puts it bluntly: lower performing retailers are depl=
oying Generative AI at rates sometimes 90% higher than the best sales growt=
h performers=E2=80=94"You cannot take an AI helicopter to LaGuardia and ski=
p the hard work required for the data foundation".
If your internal wiki has different sections, those sections need semantic =
meaning. Article titles need to be separated and meaningful. If you're deal=
ing with health records, patient names need clear semantic separation from =
diagnoses. The cleaner your data inputs, the more likely you are to have a =
strong AI experience. The more you clarify what data you want to convey, th=
e easier it becomes for AI to actually extract value.
2. Magic Wand Thinking About Models
People assume they need faster, better, stronger reasoner models for everyt=
hing. I'm on record advocating that people move their daily driver from Cha=
tGPT-4.0 to stronger models=E2=80=94go to o3, go to Gemini 2.5 Pro, go to O=
pus 4. That's helpful for personal productivity.
But it does not mean every single aspect of an AI job requires the best rea=
soner model available.
If you just want columns sorted correctly in a PDF, you don't need the best=
 reasoner model on the planet. If you want to carefully extract values from=
 a nicely delineated dataset associated with a particular firm, that doesn'=
t necessarily require a reasoner model either. In fact, it might not even n=
eed an LLM. It might just be a fancy SQL query.
People overpowered their pipelines and pay Ferrari premiums. According to R=
amp's data, a year ago, businesses were paying $10 per one million tokens. =
As of March 2025, it's $2.50=E2=80=94that's a 75% decrease. Yet companies s=
till overspend because they're choosing the wrong models for the wrong task=
s.
The RAND report found that engineers themselves sometimes contribute to pro=
ject failures because they're drawn to using the latest technological advan=
cements, even when simpler solutions would suffice. They're paying to feel =
like they have "intelligence," but real intelligence in the workplace is we=
ll-organized data, the right model applied against that data with the right=
 queries, the right guardrails, and the right evaluations=E2=80=94all surfa=
ced in a way humans can actually use.
Think about that chain: right data, right model, right constraints enabling=
 useful work, surfaced for human understanding. Notice how small a role the=
 model plays? ChatGPT-5 may be the best Ferrari in the business when it lau=
nches, but it's a tiny component in that overall value flow. You have to th=
ink more broadly if you're trying to build interesting AI work that actuall=
y delivers value.
3. Vague or Shifting Objectives
A human problem that appears again and again. You need a meaningful busines=
s KPI that you're nailing your AI project to=E2=80=94one that solves a spec=
ific business problem. And that problem has to matter.
If your business problem doesn't matter, people give up and walk away. I've=
 seen it repeatedly. If your business problem matters but isn't tied to a K=
PI=E2=80=94just annoying to a small section of the team=E2=80=94it won't ge=
t prioritized.
According to Gartner, at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abando=
ned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, due to poor data quality, in=
adequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value. Rita Sa=
llam from Gartner notes: "After last year's hype, executives are impatient =
to see returns on GenAI investments, yet organizations are struggling to pr=
ove and realize value".
The problem has to matter to the organization, be measurable in a business =
KPI, and you have to nail that objective down publicly at every opportunity=
 to keep it from shifting when you inevitably hit problems.
AI projects are a series of nested problem sets that you continue solving u=
ntil you reach actual value. You won't have the patience to work through th=
ose nested problems without a clear KPI that the business cares about, that=
 the C-suite cares about, that they're willing to move resources to support=
=2E That's what drives persistence. Tha=
t's what makes teams push through the=20=
inevitable setbacks.
4. Treating AI Strategy as Separate from Business Strategy
This subtle failure destroys value. AI strategy cannot be separate from bus=
iness strategy if you want to avoid wasting budget. If you want to actually=
 progress toward becoming an AI-native business, you cannot have "the AI st=
rategy" sitting in the corner with the AI guy or AI gal, isolated from core=
 operations.
The disconnect is staggering: only 57% of employees say their company even =
has an AI strategy=E2=80=94but 89% of the C-suite believes they do. This pe=
rception gap shows how disconnected AI initiatives are from actual business=
 operations.
You cannot treat AI as just another project. You have to integrate AI strat=
egy into your business strategy in a way that makes sense. This requires ex=
ecutives taking the time to understand how large language models work at a =
fairly granular level so they can identify leverage points in their busines=
s where AI applies.
83% of companies place AI at the forefront of their strategic planning, yet=
 more than 80% of respondents say their organizations aren't seeing a tangi=
ble impact on enterprise-level EBIT from their use of gen AI. This gap betw=
een strategic importance and actual results shows the fundamental disconnec=
t.
Let's say you run a business you think has nothing to do with AI. Customer =
service is paramount=E2=80=94all about white-glove human experience. Execut=
ives in these situations tell me, "AI might be useful here and there, but i=
t's not transformational for our business. We're not buying the hype."
Wrong. Dead wrong.
Competitors will see opportunities you miss because of that attitude. Yes, =
your human-touch value proposition might be resilient to AI. Congratulation=
s. But your back office has no excuse for lacking an entire AI strategy foc=
used on cutting business costs. And that doesn't just mean firing people. I=
t means tracking inventory more efficiently, querying datasets more effecti=
vely, pricing more intelligently.
5. Over-Relying on Off-the-Shelf Foundation Models
People think generic LLMs will fit every niche domain. When they don't, the=
y immediately assume they need to train their own model=E2=80=94without und=
erstanding what that even means.
In almost every conversation, someone asks, "Do we need to train a model fo=
r this?" The model makers bear some blame here. They've made it seem believ=
able and plausible to train custom models. It's not. It's expensive, comple=
x, and usually unnecessary.
Instead, think about your data architecture. Think about constraints and gu=
ardrails that enable your model to flourish. Think about your prompt engine=
ering. Consider whether you need a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) dat=
aset. Think about providing the right context for the model to process jobs=
 appropriately.
But people don't do this work. They say, "The model should know it." The RA=
ND study highlighted that business leaders often misunderstand or miscommun=
icate what problems need to be solved using AI, with one interviewee noting=
: "They think they have great data because they get weekly sales reports, b=
ut they don't realize the data they have currently may not meet its new pur=
pose".
There's this persistent fallacy that models are intelligent because of what=
 they "know," when in reality, transformer-based architectures are intellig=
ent because of how they transform and predict the next token. The intellige=
nce comes from transformation, not from magical knowledge.
6. Ignoring Integrations and Operations for AI
Teams demo proof-of-concepts with zero operational readiness. No evaluation=
s. No monitoring. No rollback procedures. They don't know their production =
bar. If something reaches production, they can't monitor it. They don't und=
erstand their tool dependencies or vulnerabilities when those tools change.=
 They have no plan for refreshing underlying datasets.
They think, again, the model will handle it. Put the model in production, a=
nd the model solves the problem. That's exactly the mindset that landed Air=
 Canada in court over an AI-invented bereavement policy.
The RAND report emphasizes: "Under investment in infrastructure emerged as =
another key factor in AI project failures. Organizations often lack adequat=
e systems for data management and model deployment". They note that "invest=
ing in data engineers and ML engineers can substantially shorten the time r=
equired to develop a new AI model and deploy it to a production environment=
".
You cannot ignore AI operations. In fact, if you're looking for a career pa=
th, AI operations is gold. Figuring out how to stably and safely deploy AI =
in production, how to pull it back, how to handle sandboxes=E2=80=94this is=
 complex, valuable work.
This has all the characteristics of software. You cannot deploy it as if it=
's not software and expect success. Most organizations ignore this at their=
 peril. I constantly remind people: this is software with all of software's=
 complexity plus additional unpredictability.
7. No Human in the Loop
The Klarna story is famous, but I see this pattern everywhere. Over-eager C=
EOs read LinkedIn hype and decide, "We don't need these people. I want AI s=
o people lose their jobs and I can cut this team."
They don't realize Klarna had to rehire their customer service team. McDona=
ld's provides an even more spectacular example: after deploying AI drive-th=
ru ordering at over 100 locations, the company's CEO Chris Kempczinski said=
 the tech reported about an 85% accuracy rate in recognizing orders. That m=
ight sound good until you realize what the other 15% looked like.
Viral videos showed the AI adding hundreds of dollars in chicken nuggets to=
 orders, confusing ice cream with ketchup and butter packets. One customer =
filmed the AI inexplicably adding two sides of butter and four ketchup pack=
ets to an order of water and vanilla ice cream. McDonald's ended the partne=
rship with IBM in July 2024, pulling the technology from all test locations=
=2E
When designing systems, anticipate non-happy paths. This is basic product m=
anagement=E2=80=94don't just plan for success, plan for failure. How do you=
 make failure graceful, less miserable, more likely to retain customers?
When AI goes wrong and the human knows it but the AI won't admit it, how do=
es the human get help? People don't spend enough time on this. They expect =
100% accuracy from AI when they'd never expect that from humans. That's not=
 reasonable.
Something can be tremendously useful at 87% accuracy. Depending on your app=
lication, you might have AI that's 87% correct with humans handling the rem=
aining 13%. Your job is designing systems that switch cleanly between those=
 modes. I see almost no investment in figuring out these numbers or solving=
 these handoff problems.
8. Under-Investing in Change Management
Massive, massive issue. People assume if they put AI in front of teams, mag=
ic happens. Model makers are guilty here too, with leak after leak about Ch=
atGPT-5 being the next revolutionary breakthrough.
The reality is stark: 59% of executives say they're "actively looking for a=
 new job with a company that's more innovative with generative AI," while a=
mong employees, the number is 35%. Meanwhile, 53% of employees said they hi=
d their AI use from employers for fear that it would make them look replace=
able.
Deloitte's research found that resistance to adopting GenAI solutions slowe=
d project timelines, usually stemming from unfamiliarity with the technolog=
ies or from skill and technical gaps. One-in-five organizations report they=
 do not have employees with the right skills in place to use new AI or auto=
mation tools and 16% cannot find new hires with the skills to address that =
gap.
People will go through this cycle again, thinking they can give organizatio=
ns ChatGPT-5 and watch their bottom line transform. That might be convenien=
t for model makers' sales teams, but it's fantasy.
You have to invest in change management and upskilling to get people actual=
ly using AI. Otherwise, chatbots load nicely, people interact with them for=
 two or three basic tasks weekly, and you don't come close to realizing the=
 model's power. Not even close.
Yet most organizations invest more in models and technical stacks than in p=
eople. They're not investing in change management or upskilling. 41% of bus=
inesses are struggling to find employees to support their generative AI ini=
tiatives due to a longstanding skills gap in AI and machine learning.
9. Forgetting the Total Cost of Ownership
People don't think about token costs. They don't think about developer sust=
ainment costs. They don't think about the hit-by-a-bus problem where one de=
veloper owns everything and if something happens to them, you're done. They=
 don't think about the sustainment costs of evaluating models in production=
=2E
Consider Zillow's catastrophic failure with their AI-powered home-buying bu=
siness. The company wrote down $304 million in Q3 2021, with their stock pr=
ice dropping from $105 to $63 in a matter of days, wiping off roughly $10 b=
illion in market cap. They ultimately lost $881 million on the business and=
 laid off 2,000+ employees.
The problem wasn't just bad predictions=E2=80=94it was the total cost of ho=
lding inventory, renovating properties, and the cascade of expenses that fo=
llowed their flawed model. An analyst estimated that possibly 2/3rds of the=
 homes that Zillow purchased were valued at below what Zillow paid for them=
=2E
They just think: "Can we get this to production? Great, we'll worry about t=
he rest later." There's such a forced-march mentality to beat competitors t=
o market. I get it=E2=80=94it's an existential imperative. You have to get =
AI to market. But understanding cloud inference costs, understanding vector=
 database queries, understanding cost guardrails is critical. You can be up=
side down on margins fast.
The typical AI software cost depends on functionality and support required,=
 ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per month for subscriptions. The average c=
ost of AI data acquisition and preparation can range from $10,000 for a sma=
ll pilot project to $1 million for a large-scale one.
I'd argue the 80/20 ratio flips=E2=80=9480% of your time should be spent on=
 production use cases because you can't adequately test models for all scen=
arios before launch. You have to hit a threshold and say, "We'll launch and=
 keep evaluating." That means more sustainment costs nobody factors in.
10. Security and Privacy Shortcuts
"We'll worry about where the data lives later." Classic. "I'm not sure what=
 the security requirements are. Let's just get started." Or: "I haven't loo=
ked at the terms of service for the vendor. I don't know how they relate to=
 the foundation model maker. Someone else will figure that out."
Samsung learned this lesson the hard way. In just 20 days, three incidents =
occurred where engineers entered confidential information into ChatGPT=E2=
=80=94one entered Samsung's source code when looking for a solution to a bu=
g, another transcribed a company meeting into ChatGPT to create meeting not=
es, and a third used ChatGPT to optimize a test sequence for identifying yi=
eld and defective chips.
The result? Samsung banned the use of generative AI tools on company-owned =
devices and internal networks. As one memo warned: "Such data is impossible=
 to retrieve as it is now stored on the servers belonging to OpenAI".
Cyberhaven research found that 3.1% of customers who used AI had at one poi=
nt submitted confidential company data into the system, estimating a compan=
y with around 100,000 employees could be sharing confidential data with Ope=
nAI hundreds of times per week.
You cannot do this. You have to know the story of your data from day one be=
cause the risk of misuse is too high. This doesn't actually help you go fas=
ter because solutions exist. You can read terms of service quickly. You can=
 understand which secure cloud environment to deploy into. You can become c=
ompliant and secure with relatively little effort two and a half years into=
 the AI revolution.
There's no excuse. You can't claim speed as a reason for security shortcuts=
=2E You have to take security and privacy seriously.
The Secret 11th Problem
Here's my favorite one that didn't make the official list: the CEO not know=
ing how to use AI. That's a problem. I've mentioned it before. If the CEO d=
oesn't know how to use AI, it's nearly impossible to drive AI transformatio=
n. Period.
72% of US CEOs regard generative AI as a crucial investment area, yet most =
can't use it effectively themselves. It's not a general-purpose technology =
that works if half the people at the top don't really know how to use it.
The Bottom Line
Look through these ten problems. Notice how many are people and process ver=
sus technical architecture. Not just models or data=E2=80=94not just models=
=2E Again and again, I've called this out.
The statistics are sobering: PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer shows that=
 while productivity growth has quadrupled in AI-exposed industries=E2=80=94=
rising from 7% (2018=E2=80=932022) to 27% (2018=E2=80=932024)=E2=80=94this =
success is concentrated among a select group of organizations that have mas=
tered the implementation fundamentals.
This is why I continue saying new models are great. I'm glad we're getting =
them. It's a phenomenal time to be alive and working. But they're not magic=
 bullets. They don't magically solve everything. Instead, they help you=E2=
=80=94when you have good architecture, when you've solved these problems=E2=
=80=94to generate more return on investment than you would otherwise.
A better model in a clean data environment with an excellent human-in-the-l=
oop safety net, with good MLOps deployment practices, with a coherent AI st=
rategy=E2=80=94that's going to go farther. It's like putting an engine in a=
 properly constructed car. You'll actually get the most out of it.
Compare that to people trying to jam Formula One engines into janky Model T=
 Fords thinking, "We've got a Formula One engine in here, just floor it. I'=
m sure it'll work."
No. It's not going to work.
Take the time to set your business up for new models. ChatGPT-5 will be gre=
at, but there's another model coming in a month, two months, three months. =
We're in the middle of an exponential curve. We're going to see more expone=
ntial improvements. That's why it's critical to focus on these durable aspe=
cts of organizational change. There's no substitute.
The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the best models. They're=
 the ones who stopped believing in magic and started doing the work.

=80=94they're human and organizational failures that cost companies million=
s while they wait for the next magical model release. 42% of companies are =
now abandoning most of their AI initiatives, up from 17% last year, with th=

ost AI failures have nothing to do with model capabilities. They're boring,=
 predictable organizational failures that executives refuse to acknowledge.=
 The model makers want you to believe their next release will transform you=
r business. They leak breathless updates about reasoning capabilities and b=
enchmark scores. Meanwhile, estimates for AI project failure rates are cons=
istently high, ranging from 70% to 85%=E2=80=94more than 80 percent of AI p=
rojects fail, twice the rate of failure of information technology projects =
that do not involve AI.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=

 delusion: &quot;We'll just give our data to the LLM and it will fix it.&qu=
ot; They're on Azure cloud using Copilot. They're using Gemini. They're usi=

ir data chaos into insight.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

 data readiness as the root cause. Data readiness is not something an LLM w=
ill magically solve. Gartner predicts that through 2025, at least 50% of ge=
nerative AI projects will be abandoned at the pilot stage due to poor data =
quality, among other factors.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">There's a school of thought o=
n the research side that eventually AI will become so sophisticated it can =
parse massive, messy human data with huge context windows and just make sen=
se of everything. This gets voiced as if it's available today. It's not. An=
d even if it becomes possible, feeding AI garbage data remains organization=
al malpractice.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=

be their data problems while showing me data with zero semantic meaning to =
an LLM. It's just an undifferentiated blob=E2=80=94uncategorized, unorganiz=
ed. Thousands and thousands of documents with no structure. You haven't giv=
en the model any sense of semantic meaning in the larger data structures. Y=
ou have no sub-corpus semantic structures to work with.</p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The=

f your internal wiki has different sections, those sections need semantic m=
eaning. Article titles need to be separated and meaningful. If you're deali=
ng with health records, patient names need clear semantic separation from d=
iagnoses. The cleaner your data inputs, the more likely you are to have a s=
trong AI experience. The more you clarify what data you want to convey, the=
 easier it becomes for AI to actually extract value.</p><h2 class=3D"header=

cidents occurred where engineers entered confidential information into Chat=
GPT=E2=80=94one entered Samsung's source code when looking for a solution t=

around 100,000 employees could be sharing confidential data with OpenAI hun=

gh. This doesn't actually help you go faster because solutions exist. You c=
