Ok this one has been brewing for awhile. I=E2=80=99ve been feeling this hug=
e looming gap between the way I use ChatGPT and Claude and Gemini and other=
 LLMs and the way lots of my colleagues use these tools.
Fundamentally, with the launch of Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT o=
3 these LLM chatbots are becoming Everything Engines. But here=E2=80=99s th=
e catch: you can=E2=80=99t tell, because they don=E2=80=99t look different.
It is really hard to explain, so I decided to show it instead. I built thre=
e real models inside ChatGPT o3 that I road-tested on real data. It=E2=80=
=99s not just an LLM simulating a model. Because o3 is calling python and o=
ther tools and actually designing and building an actuarial model it can ex=
plain for these three challenges.
What are they? Well they=E2=80=99re the most interesting questions I could =
think of that I wanted to look at more closely from a data perspective.
Will this AI product launch succeed?
What are the odds I=E2=80=99ll buy a house in my zip code?
Is that layoff really =E2=80=9Cbecause of AI=E2=80=9D?
We talk about all of these topics in the news all the time and mostly it=E2=
=80=99s a bunch of opinions. What if we built a model to represent what we =
know about the underlying data in a more rigorous way? Before, that would h=
ave taken a whole data team and lots of patience. Now, it=E2=80=99s just a =
smart chat away.
I hope you enjoy these three models, and I hope you get a sense of how easy=
 it is to build more complex (not language) outputs in these advanced Every=
thing Engines.=20
Subscribers get all these posts!
Beyond Chat: Three Tiny Forecasting Engines You Can Build in One o3 Session
Most people open ChatGPT and think conversation. They ask for brainstorming=
 help, polish an email, maybe draft code. That=E2=80=99s fine=E2=80=94but i=
t barely scratches the surface of what the o3 model can do once you give it=
 a Python kernel and tool access.
In the last day I=E2=80=99ve used a single o3 chat thread to build three bi=
te=E2=80=91sized data models, each one end=E2=80=91to=E2=80=91end: from sou=
rcing raw numbers to running live math to packaging a narrative explanation=
=2E None of them took more than twenty=20=
minutes. Each of them replaced work th=
at would normally sprawl across a spreadsheet, a notebook, and a slide deck=
=2E
Below is a walk=E2=80=91through of those three models, why they matter, and=
 how the language=E2=80=91plus=E2=80=91tools loop makes them possible.
A note on style: there is a fair bit of math here, but all of it is explain=
ed. I also am logical in how I lay out the sections, so keep that in mind s=
ince this is a long post. I first write an overall explainer of each sectio=
n. Then I deep dive how it works. Then I give a sample output. For all thre=
e models. Finally, I=E2=80=99ll note that there are lots of screenshotted t=
ables here, because it=E2=80=99s a way to put sunlight on how o3 interacts =
with the model and builds.
1. Will This AI Product Launch Succeed?
What the model does
It converts a rowdy debate=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWill this new coding assistant =
hit its goals?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94into a single probability grounded in real =
launch history. Because only about 15=E2=80=9330=E2=80=AF% of AI launches e=
ver clear their own bar, even a 55=E2=80=AF% prediction means =E2=80=9Cthre=
e times more promising than average.=E2=80=9D
How o3 builds it
Define success. I asked o3 to draft audit=E2=80=91ready targets (e.g., =E2=
=80=9C=E2=89=A5=E2=80=AF$30=E2=80=AFM ARR within 12=E2=80=AFmonths while ho=
lding share loss under=E2=80=AF15=E2=80=AF%=E2=80=9D). I picked one.
Factor library. o3 proposed ten 1=E2=80=91to=E2=80=915 =E2=80=9Clenses=E2=
=80=9D=E2=80=94Market pain, Distribution reach, and so on=E2=80=94complete =
with definitions and evidence examples.
Historical scoring. I dropped twenty past launches into a Google Sheet. o3 =
scraped press releases, filled in first=E2=80=91pass scores, and flagged ci=
tations; I spot=E2=80=91checked.
Weight & combine. A quick Python call inside chat averaged the factors with=
 my chosen weights.
Calibrate. One sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression later, we had =CE=B2=
=E2=80=91coefficients mapping raw scores to win=E2=80=91rates.
Iterate. I asked, =E2=80=9CRe=E2=80=91plot if Distribution weight is 0.25.=
=E2=80=9D The kernel reran instantly and showed the new ROC curve.
Why it matters
Instead of battling over adjectives (=E2=80=9Cpromising,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C=
medium risk=E2=80=9D), the team now argues inputs they can see: factor scor=
es, evidence snippets, calibration plots. The model is humble=E2=80=94it ne=
ver shows >=E2=80=AF60=E2=80=AF%=E2=80=94but it lets us rank bets with a sh=
red of statistical defensibility.=20
AI Product Launch: Model Deep Dive
Ok, here=E2=80=99s an end-to-end brief that shows exactly how an LLM-plus-P=
ython toolchain builds, calibrates, and maintains the model.
1=E2=80=83What this model really delivers
It converts a noisy launch debate into a single probability=E2=80=94grounde=
d in historical hit-rate=E2=80=94that the product will meet its own busines=
s targets.
Because only ~15=E2=80=9330 % of AI launches historically clear their bar, =
the model=E2=80=99s ceiling is intentionally low: a 55 % prediction already=
 means =E2=80=9C3=C3=97 more promising than average.=E2=80=9D
2=E2=80=83Step-by-step development workflow
1. Define =E2=80=9Csuccess=E2=80=9D
Pick a binary, auditable target (e.g., =E2=80=9C=E2=89=A5 $30 M ARR and < 1=
5 % share loss in 12 mo=E2=80=9D).
LLM drafts candidate targets; humans lock one.
2. Build factor library
Choose ~8=E2=80=9310 risk lenses (Market pain, Distribution reach, etc.), e=
ach scored 1-to-5.
LLM proposes factors, definitions, example evidence.
3. Score historical launches
Rate ~20 prior products on each factor; label them Success/Failure vs. targ=

6=E2=80=83Why an LLM-plus-Python loop is ideal
Large-language models and an embedded Python runtime split the work almost =
perfectly:
Exploring ideas and drafting content
The LLM shines at anything linguistic or conceptual. It can brainstorm fact=
or names, propose clear definitions, draft scoring rubrics, and even pull q=
uick evidence snippets from press releases or blog posts to justify provisi=
onal 1-to-5 scores. Because it =E2=80=9Cthinks=E2=80=9D in natural language=
, you can converse with it the way you would with a colleague: =E2=80=9CWha=
t would a Data-Privacy factor look like?=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CRewrite that =
definition so legal can understand it.=E2=80=9D
Building and running the actual math
Once the conversation settles on factors and weights, Python takes over. A =
few lines of code=E2=80=94often autogenerated by the LLM itself=E2=80=94cal=
culate weighted averages, fit the logistic regression, and spit back the =
=CE=B2-coefficients. The same kernel can instantly plot the sigmoid curve o=
r an ROC chart, letting you see at a glance whether the model is too optimi=
stic or too harsh.
Iterating in a single conversational loop
The real magic is that both tools live inside one chat thread. You can say,=
 =E2=80=9CIncrease the Distribution weight to 0.25 and re-plot,=E2=80=9D an=
d the LLM will (a) rewrite the code, (b) run it, and (c) show the updated c=
hart=E2=80=94all without context-switching to a separate notebook. That tig=
ht feedback cycle means you reach a calibrated, defensible model in minutes=
 instead of hours.
Producing the final, human-readable report
After the numbers are locked, the LLM turns raw outputs into narrative: pla=
in-English explanations of what the coefficients mean, bullet-pointed risk =
summaries, and executive-level take-aways. Python supplies the hard data; t=
he LLM wraps it in prose your stakeholders can absorb.
In short: the LLM handles words, reasoning, and code scaffolding; Python ha=
ndles execution, math, and visualization. Keeping them in one conversationa=
l workspace eliminates hand-offs and lets you move from idea to calibrated =
probability in a single sitting.

Read-out for the board
Perplexity=E2=80=99s launch sits on the knife-edge: strong market pull and =
good timing, but average reach, thin moat, and non-trivial IP risk cap the =
win-rate at ~50 %.
Focus every dollar on (1) accelerated channel expansion, (2) gross-margin d=
iscipline, and (3) a defensible enterprise-specific feature before the larg=
er platforms set the standard.

age. The model=E2=80=99s job is to surface that relative lift, not to promi=
se certainty.
Hand this package to the next team debating an AI launch; they=E2=80=99ll a=
rgue inputs, not gut feelings.
2. What Are the Odds I=E2=80=99ll Buy a House in My ZIP?
What the model does
For any U.S. ZIP code, it estimates the probability that a typical renter b=
ecomes a homeowner within five years. The engine blends:
National renter=E2=80=91to=E2=80=91owner transition rates
Local affordability (income vs. price)
Tenure mix (how many neighbors already own)
Inventory tightness
It spits out both the annual chance and the cumulative five=E2=80=91year fi=
gure, plus a lightweight sensitivity band.
How o3 builds it
Fetch data. A web.search_query pulls American Community Survey tables and Z=
illow price indices.
Clean data. The Python kernel parses =E2=80=9C$375=E2=80=AFk=E2=80=9D strin=
gs into floats, fixes missing values, and formats rates.
Compute. A short function applies the multiplicative formula and rolls it f=
orward five years.
Narrate. o3 folds the numbers into prose=E2=80=94and, when asked, plots a q=
uick bar chart of sensitivity to mortgage rates.
Why it matters
This is a cocktail=E2=80=91napkin actuarial model that would normally requi=
re a data scientist=E2=80=99s afternoon. Here it lives in chat, complete wi=
th citations and code you can re=E2=80=91run by changing one cell (=E2=80=
=9CZIP=E2=80=AF=3D=E2=80=AF28027=E2=80=9D).=20
Deep Dive =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CHow an LLM-plus-tools workflow built a ZIP-lev=
el =E2=80=98Will I Buy a House?=E2=80=99 model=E2=80=9D
1. Model capacity
The package estimates the probability that a typical renter in a given U S =
ZIP code will become a homeowner in that same ZIP within the next five year=
s. It:
blends publicly available housing, income, and tenure statistics;
adjusts a national =E2=80=9Crenter =E2=86=92 owner=E2=80=9D transition rate=
 with ZIP-specific multipliers;
returns both an annual probability and the five-year cumulative chance, plu=
s a simple sensitivity band.
2. Why it matters
Many people think of large language models (LLMs) as text generators, yet i=
n practice they can orchestrate full analytic pipelines: locating data, cle=
aning it, running code, and returning an interpretable narrative. At least =
within reasonable context window limits. This toy actuarial model shows how=
 an LLM, equipped with built-in browsing and Python tools, can assemble a l=
ightweight forecasting engine in a single conversational loop=E2=80=94no se=
parate notebook required.
3. End-to-end architecture
Minimal code core (excerpt)
import math

def five_year_prob(p_year):
    """Return cumulative 5-yr probability from constant annual rate."""
    return 1 - (1 - p_year) ** 5

BASE_R2O =3D 0.03         # National renter=E2=86=92owner annual transition

print(round(p_year*100, 2), "% per year")
print(round(p_5yr*100, 1), "% within five years")
The LLM decides when to run this code, inspects the output, and folds the n=
umbers into its written answer=E2=80=94no human copy-paste required.
4. Statistical engine in plain English
Start with the national baseline: Roughly 3 % of renters become owners each=
 year according to longitudinal American Community Survey panels.
Adjust for affordability: Compare the ZIP=E2=80=99s median household income=
 to the income required to afford the local median-priced home (30 % DTI ru=
le).
If the typical household can almost afford a purchase, the multiplier hover=
s near 1; if homes cost twice what locals earn, the multiplier falls well b=
elow 1.
Adjust for tenure mix: ZIPs where most residents already own tend to keep p=
roducing new owners; heavily renter ZIPs do the opposite. Ratio =3D local o=
wnership rate =C3=B7 US 65 % baseline.
Adjust for market tightness: Short days-on-market or ultra-low inventory sh=
ave the odds; lumbering inventory nudges them up.
Compute the annual probability: Multiply the baseline by all three factors.
Roll forward five years: Assume the adjusted chance stays constant and appl=
y 1-(1-p)^{5}.
It is deliberately simple=E2=80=94transparent enough for non-statisticians,=
 yet responsive to the three levers that matter most.
5. Key assumptions (and why we made them)
6. Limitations & upgrade paths
Static income: Pull IRS median AGI changes each year to let the model =E2=
=80=9Cearn raises.=E2=80=9D
Credit constraints: Layer Experian Move-Up Buyer score data to capture the =
share of renters who could qualify for any mortgage at all.
Spatial substitution: Let probability leak into adjacent ZIPs if the househ=
old is likely to move a few miles for lower prices.
Time-varying multipliers: Swap the closed-form 1-(1-p)^5 for a small Monte =
Carlo that re-draws affordability under plausible rate/price scenarios.
7. Teaching points for an LLM-tools class
LLM as orchestrator, not oracle =E2=80=93 It decides which tool to call, wh=
en, and with what arguments.
Reproducibility beats opacity =E2=80=93 Each numeric claim is traceable to =
a cited source and a line of Python.
Human-readable first =E2=80=93 The model is expressed in words before code;=
 the target audience sees the logic before the math.
Rapid iteration =E2=80=93 Switching zips to a median-USA ZIP 28027 (Concord=
, NC) required one chat turn, because every step is parameterised.
Honest boundaries =E2=80=93 The narrative names its error bars and links im=
provement ideas, modelling the kind of humility regulators and executives n=
ow expect from AI outputs.
8. Bottom line
Within a few hundred tokens the LLM fetched data, ran live calculations, ex=
plained its reasoning, and surfaced caveats=E2=80=94demonstrating how langu=
age plus built-in tooling equals a lightweight, auditable analytics stack. =
Replace the housing inputs with churn metrics, disease incidence, or ESG sc=
ores and the exact same pattern lets non-technical teams stand up back-of-t=
he-envelope forecasts in minutes rather than weeks.

3. Actuarial-style probability engine
4. How to read the number
Roughly 1-in-7 typical renters in 28027 can expect to own a home in the sam=
e ZIP within five years if today=E2=80=99s prices, rates, and credit norms =
persist.
That is three to four times higher than in expensive coastal ZIPs like Seat=
tle 98119 because incomes and home prices sit much closer to the national m=
edians.
5. Key sensitivities
6. Caveats
ZIP-level ACS estimates carry =C2=B15=E2=80=937 ppt margins of error.
The model ignores individual credit scores, savings, or life events.
A large rate shock or recession would move the affordability multiplier fas=
test.
Bottom line: For a statistically average household in Concord=E2=80=99s 280=
27, the actuarial odds of buying locally by 2030 sit near 14 percent=E2=80=
=94close to the national norm and dramatically higher than in high-cost, re=
nter-heavy metros.
3. Is That Layoff Really =E2=80=9CBecause of AI=E2=80=9D?
What the model does
Headlines love to claim that every workforce reduction is =E2=80=9Cdriven b=
y generative AI.=E2=80=9D This model scores a layoff announcement on nine f=

estructuring
How o3 builds it
Scrape evidence. Paste the press release URL; o3 chunks it, tags passages, =
and notes buzzword density.
Score factors. Each factor is capped (Gold/Silver/Bronze evidence) and pena=
lised for hype or single=E2=80=91source claims.
Apply guardrails. Contradictions=E2=80=94like a low task=E2=80=91fit but hi=
gh automation rate=E2=80=94trigger automatic penalties.
Logistic transform. A one=E2=80=91line Python function maps the weighted sc=
ore onto a calibrated probability curve.
Bootstrap CI. A mini=E2=80=91Monte=E2=80=91Carlo inside the kernel outputs =
a 90=E2=80=AF% confidence interval so we can see uncertainty.
Why it matters
The model injects basic rigor into a news cycle that moves too fast for dee=
p analysis. Instead of tweeting hot takes, we can say, =E2=80=9CMicrosoft=

he assumptions baked in, and how an LLM=E2=80=91plus=E2=80=91Python tool=E2=
=80=91chain operationalises it in practice.
1. What the model tells you (capability)
Output: a probability (with a 90=E2=80=AF% confidence band) that a given te=
ch=E2=80=91sector layoff was causally driven by AI automation, not just rou=
tine cost=E2=80=91cutting or generic =E2=80=9CAI investment=E2=80=9D hype.
Granularity: nine factor scores showing why the probability landed where it=
 did, plus a contradiction penalty that flags hype=E2=80=91heavy claims.
Auditability: every score is traceable to evidence snippets and a tier (gol=
d/silver/bronze) so critics can replay the entire chain of reasoning.
TL;DR: Think of it as a lie=E2=80=91detector for =E2=80=9Cthe robots took o=
ur jobs=E2=80=9D headlines.
2. Key assumptions
Public evidence exists. At least bronze=E2=80=91tier documents are availabl=

=80=9D

=91off tasks to benchmarks from the previous 3 months (e.g., SWE=E2=80=91be=
nch, CodeQL, MMLU=E2=80=91Pro).
Independence of sources. Two news outlets repeating a press release do not =
count as independent.
LLM extraction accuracy =E2=89=A5 90=E2=80=AF%. Prompting templates have be=
en validated on a 50=E2=80=91snippet test set.

5. How to read the output
{
  "event_id": "2025-05-07-CrowdStrike",
  "probability_point": 0.37,
  "probability_90CI": [0.25, 0.48],
  "factor_breakdown": {
    "explicit_substitution": 0.25,
    "role_susceptibility": 0.35,
    "task_fit": 0.20,
    "selection_transparency": 0.00,
    "strategic_ai_investment": 0.25,
    "cost_vs_growth": 0.20,
    "industry_pressure": 0.50,
    "capex_reallocation": 0.25,
    "leadership_track_record": 1.00
  },
  "contradiction_penalty": 0.00,
  "model_version": "1.1"
}
Interpretation: point estimate 37=E2=80=AF% with a CI spanning possible (<0=
=2E5).
6. Extending or customising the model
Swap weights in weights.json and rerun bootstrap=E2=80=94CI auto=E2=80=91up=
dates.
Plug in alternate LLMs (e.g., Claude 3 Opus) for extraction; output schema =
unchanged.
Add regional priors by injecting a +/=E2=80=93 regional offset before logis=
tic conversion.
Feed proprietary HR data: override role_susceptibility with real task break=
downs for better accuracy.
AI Layoffs: Model Sample Output
The Common Pattern
Across all three case studies the workflow is identical:
Language first. I describe the goal in plain English. o3 proposes a schema =
that humans can read before any code runs.
Tool calls on demand. When a step needs math or scraping, o3 decides which =
built=E2=80=91in tool to fire=E2=80=94no context switching.
Tight feedback loop. I nudge weights or add data, the Python kernel reruns =
instantly, and the narrative updates in the same thread.
Auditable outputs. Every number is explainable, and it=E2=80=99s easy to st=
ress test. I can pivot or change the model and it will actually change and =
rerun.
That is the super=E2=80=91power: an analyst, a PM, or a curious reader can =
spin up a working, defensible model inside the same chat they were using fo=
r brainstorming. The distance between idea and evidence=E2=80=91backed answ=
er has collapsed from days to minutes.
Try It Yourself
Pick a question that lives in spreadsheets today=E2=80=94churn odds for a S=
aaS plan, risk of delay for a feature launch, likelihood your tomato seedli=
ngs survive a 48=E2=80=AF=C2=B0F night. Paste the inputs into o3, ask it to=
 fetch benchmarks, and let the Python kernel crunch.
Start small, stay transparent, and always keep the narrative front and cent=
er. The moment you can read and check the logic in plain English, you=E2=80=
=99ll start to trust the math=E2=80=94plus you can always double-check it i=
n another advanced LLM!
Have fun out there and remember that these Everything Engines aren=E2=80=99=
t just for chat anymore!

actors and weights, Python takes over. A few lines of code=E2=80=94often au=

logistic regression, and spit back the =CE=B2-coefficients. The same kernel=
 can instantly plot the sigmoid curve or an ROC chart, letting you see at a=
