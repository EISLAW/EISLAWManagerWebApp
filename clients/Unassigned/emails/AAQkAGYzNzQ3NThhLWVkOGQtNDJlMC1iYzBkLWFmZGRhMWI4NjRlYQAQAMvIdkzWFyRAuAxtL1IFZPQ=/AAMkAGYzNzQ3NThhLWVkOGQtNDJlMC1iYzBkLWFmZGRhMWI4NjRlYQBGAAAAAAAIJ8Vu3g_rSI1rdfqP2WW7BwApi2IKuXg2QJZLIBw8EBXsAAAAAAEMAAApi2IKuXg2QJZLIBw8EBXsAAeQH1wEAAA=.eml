THE 2020S AND ITS HISTORIC SHIFT: THE UNITED STATES [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
In my book “The Next 100 Years,” published in 2009, I predicted that in the 2020s the United States would experience a massive socio-economic crisis, as well as a substantial institutional crisis.
The forecast was based on historic cycles, whereby the former occurs roughly every 50 years and the latter roughly every 80 years. Socio-economic crises wrecked the U.S. in the 1970s, the 1920s, the
late 1800s, and so on back to the founding. Likewise, the country underwent institutional reformation after the Civil War and then again after World War II, 80 years apart. I had (and have) no
explanation for the regularity. And the realization came not from great intelligence but from simply observing the obvious.
In my next book, “The Storm Before the Calm,” published in 2020, I forecast that the socio-economic crisis would begin to emerge at the beginning of the decade, and that the full storm would begin
with the 2024 election. With both cycles peaking together, my prediction was that the storm would be more intense than usual but that the country would survive and, afterward, flourish. So it was
after the prior crises. I did not (and do not) think presidents create these crises, but I do think that the crises create presidents who attack existing institutions and then, if reelected, create
new ones. In the current case, President Donald Trump can only serve out the remainer of his term. Therefore, a new president will preside over the two crises, with the storm calming toward the end of
the decade.
“The Storm Before the Calm” also noted that the two institutions in crisis would be the federal government and universities. The federal government that had emerged from World War II was based on
expertise. It was the experts, after all, that created the technologies and strategies of the Second World War. The problem with what might be called the technocratic state is that the experts had
massive power but, being experts, little oversight of or collaboration with bureaucratic structures. The old structure, in which the president governed with generalist advisers who helped manage and
coordinate the system, was turned into a system of focused expertise, powerful in its domain but uncoordinated with other expert domains. In effect, the federal government’s bureaucracy governed the
nation, sometimes contradictorily. I argued that the institutional crisis of the 2020s, like previous institutional crises, would be painful because it would overturn norms, generate division and
leave blood on the floor, figuratively and literally. Such was the case in previous crises during the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and World War II.
“The Storm Before the Calm” also predicted that another institution – the university – would be reformed and reorganized. It was simply a matter of economic necessity. Government college loans
had exceeded the amount of debt in the subprime mortgage crisis, and universities had no interest in controlling tuition costs. University systems were also developing an ideological concept as a
principle of education and functioning: diversity. Universities have always had ideological and social principles, but as the social order shifted, it clashed with university ideology. The same thing
had happened at elite universities in the first half of the 20th century when they started to base admission on social class standing. This system was destroyed by the GI Bill, flooding universities
with war veterans from the lower classes. Schools adopted egalitarianism as a governing principle of both admission and internal ideology. Just as elitist universities had been overwhelmed by
veterans, universities were following the bill's extreme application, this time focused on racial equality, gender equality, and then various other sexual identities, with bureaucracies ensuring
outcomes.
Universities are institutions and, as such, are part of the institutional crisis. But they hold cultural significance. They were major forces in the culture wars that characterized the socio-economic
crisis. (Elite universities were especially so.) Institutionally, there was a question of their value relative to their cost and the impact on the economy if the loans were forgiven en masse or if
indebted students were unable to repay their loans. There were then social, economic and institutional issues. That seemed inevitable, which is why I ranked universities with the restructuring of the
federal government as a focal point of the crisis.
It seems to many that Trump created the divisions in the United States. The fact is that he was elected because the country was already deeply divided. One side was committed to prior norms, the other
to overthrowing those norms. The depth of the national divide can be seen by the relatively small margin by which he won the election. On the other hand, the strength of his side of the division can
be seen in Republicans’ taking both houses of Congress. It is true that the manner in which a president engineers solutions can be questioned, but the fact is that the division, historically
predictable, brought him to office. Such divides are always personalized in the election of a president, but the underlying reality is generated by internal forces that are, in terms of time and
nature, predictable. Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt were demonized by their enemies and worshipped by their supporters.
My prediction is that if the U.S. survived the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars, it will likely survive this moment, even if it emerges in a different condition than before. In terms
of historical precedent, these transitions are rather orderly. On the foreign policy front, Washington is behaving much as I predicted it would in “The Next Decade” (2011). I believed it would
want to redefine the Cold War institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and NATO, which would be regarded as obsolete, and forge a strategy of alliances to maintain a
global balance of power. The focus would be to avoid direct involvement in foreign wars, placing the majority of the security burden on the nations in the region involved and the economic and
technological benefits with its allies, and to use direct U.S. military force only as a last resort. We saw this approach to foreign policy in practice under the Biden administration in its policy on
Ukraine (sending equipment and weapons but no troops), and the Trump administration has only continued it. The ultimate objective seems to be avoiding conflicts that are not in America’s interest.
So far, so good.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In my book =E2=80=
=9CThe Next 100 Years,=E2=80=9D published in 2009, I predicted that in the =
2020s the United States would experience a massive socio-economic crisis, a=
s well as a substantial institutional crisis. The forecast was based on his=
toric cycles, whereby the former occurs roughly every 50 years and the latt=
er roughly every 80 years. Socio-economic crises wrecked the U.S. in the 19=
70s, the 1920s, the late 1800s, and so on back to the founding. Likewise, t=
he country underwent institutional reformation after the Civil War and then=
 again after World War II, 80 years apart. I had (and have) no explanation =
for the regularity. And the realization came not from great intelligence bu=
t from simply observing the obvious.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In my next book, =
=E2=80=9CThe Storm Before the Calm,=E2=80=9D published in 2020, I forecast =
that the socio-economic crisis would begin to emerge at the beginning of th=
e decade, and that the full storm would begin with the 2024 election. With =
both cycles peaking together, my prediction was that the storm would be mor=
e intense than usual but that the country would survive and, afterward, flo=
urish. So it was after the prior crises. I did not (and do not) think presi=
dents create these crises, but I do think that the crises create presidents=
 who attack existing institutions and then, if reelected, create new ones. =
In the current case, President Donald Trump can only serve out the remainer=
 of his term. Therefore, a new president will preside over the two crises, =
with the storm calming toward the end of the decade.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">=E2=80=9CThe Storm=
 Before the Calm=E2=80=9D also noted that the two institutions in crisis wo=
uld be the federal government and universities. The federal government that=
 had emerged from World War II was based on expertise. It was the experts, =
after all, that created the technologies and strategies of the Second World=
 War. The problem with what might be called the technocratic state is that =
the experts had massive power but, being experts, little oversight of or co=
llaboration with bureaucratic structures. The old structure, in which the p=
resident governed with generalist advisers who helped manage and coordinate=
 the system, was turned into a system of focused expertise, powerful in its=
 domain but uncoordinated with other expert domains. In effect, the federal=
 government=E2=80=99s bureaucracy governed the nation, sometimes contradict=
orily. I argued that the institutional crisis of the 2020s, like previous i=
nstitutional crises, would be painful because it would overturn norms, gene=
rate division and leave blood on the floor, figuratively and literally. Suc=
h was the case in previous crises during the Revolutionary War, the Civil W=
ar and World War II.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">=E2=80=9CThe Storm=
 Before the Calm=E2=80=9D also predicted that another institution =E2=80=93=
 the university =E2=80=93 would be reformed and reorganized. It was simply =
a matter of economic necessity. Government college loans had exceeded the a=
mount of debt in the subprime mortgage crisis, and universities had no inte=
rest in controlling tuition costs. University systems were also developing =
an ideological concept as a principle of education and functioning: diversi=
ty. Universities have always had ideological and social principles, but as =
the social order shifted, it clashed with university ideology. The same thi=
ng had happened at elite universities in the first half of the 20th century=
 when they started to base admission on social class standing. This system =
was destroyed by the GI Bill, flooding universities with war veterans from =
the lower classes. Schools adopted egalitarianism as a governing principle =
of both admission and internal ideology. Just as elitist universities had b=
een overwhelmed by veterans, universities were following the bill's extreme=
 application, this time focused on racial equality, gender equality, and th=
en various other sexual identities, with bureaucracies ensuring outcomes.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Universities are i=
nstitutions and, as such, are part of the institutional crisis. But they ho=
ld cultural significance. They were major forces in the culture wars that c=
haracterized the socio-economic crisis. (Elite universities were especially=
 so.) Institutionally, there was a question of their value relative to thei=
r cost and the impact on the economy if the loans were forgiven en masse or=
 if indebted students were unable to repay their loans. There were then soc=
ial, economic and institutional issues. That seemed inevitable, which is wh=
y I ranked universities with the restructuring of the federal government as=
 a focal point of the crisis.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It seems to many t=
hat Trump created the divisions in the United States. The fact is that he w=
as elected because the country was already deeply divided. One side was com=
mitted to prior norms, the other to overthrowing those norms. The depth of =
the national divide can be seen by the relatively small margin by which he =
won the election. On the other hand, the strength of his side of the divisi=
on can be seen in Republicans=E2=80=99 taking both houses of Congress. It i=
s true that the manner in which a president engineers solutions can be ques=
tioned, but the fact is that the division, historically predictable, brough=
t him to office. Such divides are always personalized in the election of a =
president, but the underlying reality is generated by internal forces that =
are, in terms of time and nature, predictable. Abraham Lincoln and Franklin=
 Roosevelt were demonized by their enemies and worshipped by their supporte=
rs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">My prediction is t=
hat if the U.S. survived the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world =
wars, it will likely survive this moment, even if it emerges in a different=
 condition than before. In terms of historical precedent, these transitions=
 are rather orderly. On the foreign policy front, Washington is behaving mu=
ch as I predicted it would in =E2=80=9CThe Next Decade=E2=80=9D (2011). I b=
elieved it would want to redefine the Cold War institutions such as the Int=
ernational Monetary Fund, the United Nations and NATO, which would be regar=
ded as obsolete, and forge a strategy of alliances to maintain a global bal=
ance of power. The focus would be to avoid direct involvement in foreign wa=
rs, placing the majority of the security burden on the nations in the regio=
n involved and the economic and technological benefits with its allies, and=
 to use direct U.S. military force only as a last resort. We saw this appro=
ach to foreign policy in practice under the Biden administration in its pol=
icy on Ukraine (sending equipment and weapons but no troops), and the Trump=
 administration has only continued it. The ultimate objective seems to be a=
voiding conflicts that are not in America=E2=80=99s interest.</p>
