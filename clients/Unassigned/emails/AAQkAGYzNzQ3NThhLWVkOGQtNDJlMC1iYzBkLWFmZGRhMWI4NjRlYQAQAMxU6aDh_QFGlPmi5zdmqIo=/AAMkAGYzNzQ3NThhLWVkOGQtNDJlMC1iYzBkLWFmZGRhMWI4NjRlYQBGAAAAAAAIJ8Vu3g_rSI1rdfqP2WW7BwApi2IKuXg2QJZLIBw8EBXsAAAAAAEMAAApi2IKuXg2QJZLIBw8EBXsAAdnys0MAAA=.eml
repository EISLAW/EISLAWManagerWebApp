WHY THE ISRAELI WAR IS UNSUSTAINABLE [3]
THE UNITY AND THE CAPABILITY AFTER OCT. 7 IS NO LONGER THERE.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
Israel has been fighting what’s become a multifront war for two years. And unlike its previous wars, there is no defined timeline, no geographic scope and no clear condition for victory. It’s an
open-ended contest in which military success alone may not ensure strategic sustainability.
Sustainability depends not just on battlefield performance but also on whether Israeli manpower, economic resilience, political cohesion and strategic direction can weather the storm. The demands of
simultaneous high-tempo operations are testing traditional strengths like rapid reserve mobilization and cutting-edge technology.
Perhaps most challenging is whether Israel’s warfighting posture can be sustained across the full architecture of national capacity. This includes the strain on military personnel, where sustained
mobilization is producing signs of fatigue and refusal; economic health, marked by escalating fiscal burdens and pressure on growth and investor confidence; the erosion of domestic cohesion under
prolonged uncertainty; and the widening gap between strategic objectives and the ability to achieve them.
Israel’s defense doctrine rests on the assumption that its reserve system can be rapidly mobilized and sustained across multiple campaigns. That assumption is now under visible pressure. Roughly
300,000 reservists remain mobilized, a staggering figure for a nation of 9.7 million, pulling heavily from vital civilian sectors and younger age cohorts. Many have undergone multiple deployments
since October 2023, with compressed rotation schedules and diminishing recovery periods. Units drawn from Israel’s high-tech and middle-class sectors are experiencing growing absenteeism as part of
a broader crisis of disengagement driven by financial pressure, operational fatigue and skepticism over whether the stated goal of dismantling Hamas remains achievable.
With just 170,000 active-duty personnel, the Israel Defense Forces cannot maintain multitheater operations without leaning heavily on its reserves. This places disproportionate pressure on a system
once seen as a pillar of national resilience. Participation rates have fallen sharply: Initial mobilization peaked at 120 percent, but by 2025, actual participation had dropped to as low as 60
percent. Reserve service is legally mandated, but enforcement has been inconsistent, reflecting institutional reluctance to escalate internal tensions and the limits of compelling mass compliance.
Many reservists have delayed reporting through informal deferrals, medical exemptions and protest.
The very composition of Israel’s force model is similarly strained. The IDF relies on a small standing army and a large reserve system to scale up and sustain operations. As participation drops,
this model becomes harder to execute. Once a unifying institution that bridged social divides through shared service, the reserve system is now fraying under demographic shifts and perceived
inequities in who sacrifices – and how much they give up.
Without retooling this structure – either through rotation, doctrinal adaptation, clarified objectives or phased demobilization – Israel could imperil the very manpower that underpins its
deterrence capabilities. And operational shortfalls are only part of the cost: As reservists disengage, training pipelines stall, unit cohesion erodes, and the credibility of rapid mobilization
declines. This could encourage adversaries to test Israel on multiple fronts.
Meanwhile, the shock to Israel’s wartime economy has been unlike any in its modern history. Since October 2023, cumulative war costs have reached approximately $67 billion, or 7-8 percent of gross
domestic product, despite unfettered U.S. aid. Defense spending has grown from 4.2 percent to nearly 8 percent, raising the fiscal deficit to around 7 percent in 2024 before stabilizing near 4.2
percent in 2025 under emergency budget measures.
Spending is only the tip of the iceberg. Labor shortages resulting from reservist mobilization are estimated to cost up to $600 million per week in lost output – a figure compounded by the
suspension of Palestinian work permits. The tech sector, a key source of growth and defense innovation, now faces investor uncertainty. Intel, for example, canceled a $25 billion project, while other
firms are considering relocating to safer havens. Tourism – a smaller but not insignificant contributor to GDP – has all but collapsed.
These trends raise longer-term questions over fiscal recovery, foreign investment and an industrial base that supports military procurement and political resilience. The longer Israel remains in a
high-alert, multifront posture, the greater the risk to investor confidence, deficit containment and the economic flexibility needed to sustain prolonged military operations.
So far, Israel has been able to sustain this posture because the government, the military and the public were aligned in the response to the Oct. 7 attack. But now, in mid-2025, there are cracks in
the wartime coalition. Public trust in leadership is eroding, particularly as the Netanyahu-led emergency coalition appears indecisive and internally strained. Protest movements have returned, and the
controversy over ultra-Orthodox exemptions to military service has only accentuated resentment among secular sectors.
Institutionally, the government is showing signs of disunity. Coalition members disagree on war objectives, postwar governance plans for Gaza and how to handle Hezbollah and Iran. Judicial reforms for
the supreme court, which led to nationwide protests in 2023, were never really resolved, and many in Israel are still uneasy about the prospect of limiting the court’s influence over the government.
To be sure, none of this amounts to anything that would even approximate radical change, but it does suggest enough disagreement to create political paralysis – that is, a system too fragmented to
adapt to the necessary changes of the war it’s fighting.
Geography is the cause of many of these changes and thus of Israel’s strategic dilemma. Israel is a small state, roughly 290 miles (460 kilometers) long and 85 miles wide, with adversaries on all
sides but limited strategic depth. These disadvantages meant that Israel could not realistically sustain a protracted, multifront conflict, so Israeli military doctrine was built around short,
high-intensity wars that favored overwhelming firepower and swift disengagement. But Israel’s response to Oct. 7 has exposed the structural risks of protracted conflict.
[Gaza-Israel in the Middle East] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
To the north, a fragile ceasefire with Hezbollah in June has halted major attacks but remains unstable. Though rocket and drone fire has slowed, the threat of escalation keeps Israeli forces on high
alert. Syria’s collapse has replaced a deterrable regime with an unpredictable Islamist authority. Though not openly hostile, the new regime’s control of Damascus and proximity to Israel constrain
IDF freedom of action.
In Gaza, Hamas continues asymmetric attacks despite operational attrition. Without a viable postwar plan and under mounting diplomatic pressure, prolonged occupation remains strategically costly and
politically corrosive.
In Iran, Israeli airstrikes earlier this year escalated the conflict. Sustaining pressure on Iran hurts Israel’s long-range capacity, while Houthi attacks from Yemen demand constant air defense and
stretch IDF coverage into the Red Sea. The difficulty and vigilance needed to maintain pressure notwithstanding, the financial toll is considerable.
Each theater strains manpower, deterrence, legitimacy and strategic reach. Together, they constitute a burden Israel cannot bear indefinitely. U.S. aid helps, but growing political friction among the
American public underscores the fragility of that support. Without it, Israel’s ability to project force and manage external criticism would sharply decline.
Israel isn’t without strategic options for achieving its objectives, but each carries a trade-off, and none offer iron-clad outcomes. The first option is a prolonged status quo: The campaign in Gaza
remains active, the Hezbollah ceasefire holds tenuously, Houthi drones persist and post-Assad Syria remains fragmented. But because this stretches Israeli intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
capability and response capacity, it is probably unviable in the long term. The second is retrenchment: reducing active operations in Gaza, reinforcing deterrence posture in the north and in Iran, and
stabilizing the reserve system. While more sustainable, this would require clear political messaging and a phased demobilization strategy to avoid perceptions of defeat. Israel retains the military
and logistical capacity to execute a phased drawdown, but the government may not have the ability, let alone the political capital, to communicate such a shift without triggering backlash.
The third path is escalation. This would be triggered by a break in the ceasefire with Hezbollah or a direct Iranian provocation. It would demand a full mobilization and an expansion of the conflict
throughout, and it would likely surpass Israel’s capacity to sustain a three-front war. And there’s no guarantee Hezbollah or Iran want to escalate; so far, both have avoided direct confrontation,
deterred as they are by Israeli retaliatory capacity. Still, miscalculation, internal pressures or continued Israeli strikes on strategic assets could shift the calculus.
A diplomatic off-ramp is an option that presents the most stability, but it is also the most elusive option. Though the U.S. still has leverage over Israel, meaningful deescalation would require
Israeli political alignment, external pressure and a realistic alternative to military objectives – none of which is currently in place.
Of the four imperfect paths, the most likely under current constraints is a tense status quo: low-intensity conflict, gradual force exhaustion and mounting internal strain. Meanwhile, Iran, Hezbollah
and Hamas will continue calibrated pressure to maintain operations without triggering overwhelming Israeli retaliation. Their strategic patience stretches Israel’s capacity on multiple fronts, doing
nothing to address attrition and offering no decisive military objective.
For Israel, the past two years have revealed the limits of a system designed for short wars. Manpower is exhausted, economic pressure is mounting and political cohesion is eroding. At the strategic
level, the gap between military objectives and capacity is only growing. Without clearly defined end goals, deterrence risks decay, and operations persist without closure.

ends not just on battlefield performance but also on whether Israeli manpow=
er, economic resilience, political cohesion and strategic direction can wea=
ther the storm. The demands of simultaneous high-tempo operations are testi=
ng traditional strengths like rapid reserve mobilization and cutting-edge t=
echnology.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Perhaps most chall=
enging is whether Israel=E2=80=99s warfighting posture can be sustained acr=
oss the full architecture of national capacity. This includes the strain on=
 military personnel, where sustained mobilization is producing signs of fat=
igue and refusal; economic health, marked by escalating fiscal burdens and =
pressure on growth and investor confidence; the erosion of domestic cohesio=
n under prolonged uncertainty; and the widening gap between strategic objec=
tives and the ability to achieve them.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s d=
efense doctrine rests on the assumption that its reserve system can be rapi=
dly mobilized and sustained across multiple campaigns. That assumption is n=
ow under visible pressure. Roughly 300,000 reservists remain mobilized, a s=
taggering figure for a nation of 9.7 million, pulling heavily from vital ci=
vilian sectors and younger age cohorts. Many have undergone multiple deploy=
ments since October 2023, with compressed rotation schedules and diminishin=
g recovery periods. Units drawn from Israel=E2=80=99s high-tech and middle-=
class sectors are experiencing growing absenteeism as part of a broader cri=
sis of disengagement driven by financial pressure, operational fatigue and =
skepticism over whether the stated goal of dismantling Hamas remains achiev=
able.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With just 170,000 =
active-duty personnel, the Israel Defense Forces cannot maintain multitheat=
er operations without leaning heavily on its reserves. This places dispropo=
rtionate pressure on a system once seen as a pillar of national resilience.=
 Participation rates have fallen sharply: Initial mobilization peaked at 12=
0 percent, but by 2025, actual participation had dropped to as low as 60 pe=
rcent. Reserve service is legally mandated, but enforcement has been incons=
istent, reflecting institutional reluctance to escalate internal tensions a=
nd the limits of compelling mass compliance. Many reservists have delayed r=
eporting through informal deferrals, medical exemptions and protest.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The very compositi=
on of Israel=E2=80=99s force model is similarly strained. The IDF relies on=
 a small standing army and a large reserve system to scale up and sustain o=
perations. As participation drops, this model becomes harder to execute. On=
ce a unifying institution that bridged social divides through shared servic=
e, the reserve system is now fraying under demographic shifts and perceived=
 inequities in who sacrifices =E2=80=93 and how much they give up.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Without retooling =
this structure =E2=80=93 either through rotation, doctrinal adaptation, cla=
rified objectives or phased demobilization =E2=80=93 Israel could imperil t=
he very manpower that underpins its deterrence capabilities. And operationa=
l shortfalls are only part of the cost: As reservists disengage, training p=
ipelines stall, unit cohesion erodes, and the credibility of rapid mobiliza=
tion declines. This could encourage adversaries to test Israel on multiple =
fronts.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, the sho=
ck to Israel=E2=80=99s wartime economy has been unlike any in its modern hi=
story. Since October 2023, cumulative war costs have reached approximately =
$67=E2=80=AFbillion, or 7-8 percent of gross domestic product, despite unfe=
ttered U.S. aid. Defense spending has grown from 4.2 percent to nearly 8 pe=
rcent, raising the fiscal deficit to around 7 percent in 2024 before stabil=
izing near 4.2 percent in 2025 under emergency budget measures.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Spending is only t=
he tip of the iceberg. Labor shortages resulting from reservist mobilizatio=
n are estimated to cost up to $600=E2=80=AFmillion per week in lost output =
=E2=80=93 a figure compounded by the suspension of Palestinian work permits=
. The tech sector, a key source of growth and defense innovation, now faces=
 investor uncertainty. Intel, for example, canceled a $25 billion project, =
while other firms are considering relocating to safer havens. Tourism =E2=
=80=93 a smaller but not insignificant contributor to GDP =E2=80=93 has all=
 but collapsed.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These trends raise=
 longer-term questions over fiscal recovery, foreign investment and an indu=
strial base that supports military procurement and political resilience. Th=
e longer Israel remains in a high-alert, multifront posture, the greater th=
e risk to investor confidence, deficit containment and the economic flexibi=
lity needed to sustain prolonged military operations.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">So far, Israel has=
 been able to sustain this posture because the government, the military and=
 the public were aligned in the response to the Oct. 7 attack. But now, in =
mid-2025, there are cracks in the wartime coalition. Public trust in leader=
ship is eroding, particularly as the Netanyahu-led emergency coalition appe=
ars indecisive and internally strained. Protest movements have returned, an=
d the controversy over ultra-Orthodox exemptions to military service has on=
ly accentuated resentment among secular sectors.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Institutionally, t=
he government is showing signs of disunity. Coalition members disagree on w=
ar objectives, postwar governance plans for Gaza and how to handle Hezbolla=
h and Iran. Judicial reforms for the supreme court, which led to nationwide=
 protests in 2023, were never really resolved, and many in Israel are still=
 uneasy about the prospect of limiting the court=E2=80=99s influence over t=
he government. To be sure, none of this amounts to anything that would even=
 approximate radical change, but it does suggest enough disagreement to cre=
ate political paralysis =E2=80=93 that is, a system too fragmented to adapt=
 to the necessary changes of the war it=E2=80=99s fighting.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Geography is the c=
ause of many of these changes and thus of Israel=E2=80=99s strategic dilemm=
a. Israel is a small state, roughly 290 miles (460 kilometers) long and 85 =
miles wide, with adversaries on all sides but limited strategic depth. Thes=
e disadvantages meant that Israel could not realistically sustain a protrac=
ted, multifront conflict, so Israeli military doctrine was built around sho=
rt, high-intensity wars that favored overwhelming firepower and swift disen=
gagement. But Israel=E2=80=99s response to Oct. 7 has exposed the structura=
l risks of protracted conflict.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To the north, a fr=
agile ceasefire with Hezbollah in June has halted major attacks but remains=
 unstable. Though rocket and drone fire has slowed, the threat of escalatio=
n keeps Israeli forces on high alert. Syria=E2=80=99s collapse has replaced=
 a deterrable regime with an unpredictable Islamist authority. Though not o=
penly hostile, the new regime=E2=80=99s control of Damascus and proximity t=
o Israel constrain IDF freedom of action.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Gaza, Hamas con=
tinues asymmetric attacks despite operational attrition. Without a viable p=
ostwar plan and under mounting diplomatic pressure, prolonged occupation re=
mains strategically costly and politically corrosive.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Iran, Israeli a=
irstrikes earlier this year escalated the conflict. Sustaining pressure on =
Iran hurts Israel=E2=80=99s long-range capacity, while Houthi attacks from =
Yemen demand constant air defense and stretch IDF coverage into the Red Sea=
. The difficulty and vigilance needed to maintain pressure notwithstanding,=
 the financial toll is considerable.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Each theater strai=
ns manpower, deterrence, legitimacy and strategic reach. Together, they con=
stitute a burden Israel cannot bear indefinitely. U.S. aid helps, but growi=
ng political friction among the American public underscores the fragility o=
f that support. Without it, Israel=E2=80=99s ability to project force and m=
anage external criticism would sharply decline.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel isn=E2=80=
=99t without strategic options for achieving its objectives, but each carri=
es a trade-off, and none offer iron-clad outcomes. The first option is a pr=
olonged status quo: The campaign in Gaza remains active, the Hezbollah ceas=
efire holds tenuously, Houthi drones persist and post-Assad Syria remains f=
ragmented. But because this stretches Israeli intelligence, surveillance an=
d reconnaissance capability and response capacity, it is probably unviable =
in the long term. The second is retrenchment: reducing active operations in=
 Gaza, reinforcing deterrence posture in the north and in Iran, and stabili=
zing the reserve system. While more sustainable, this would require clear p=
olitical messaging and a phased demobilization strategy to avoid perception=
s of defeat. Israel retains the military and logistical capacity to execute=
 a phased drawdown, but the government may not have the ability, let alone =
the political capital, to communicate such a shift without triggering backl=
ash.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The third path is =
escalation. This would be triggered by a break in the ceasefire with Hezbol=
lah or a direct Iranian provocation. It would demand a full mobilization an=
d an expansion of the conflict throughout, and it would likely surpass Isra=
el=E2=80=99s capacity to sustain a three-front war. And there=E2=80=99s no =
guarantee Hezbollah or Iran want to escalate; so far, both have avoided dir=
ect confrontation, deterred as they are by Israeli retaliatory capacity. St=
ill, miscalculation, internal pressures or continued Israeli strikes on str=
ategic assets could shift the calculus.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A diplomatic off-r=
amp is an option that presents the most stability, but it is also the most =
elusive option. Though the U.S. still has leverage over Israel, meaningful =
deescalation would require Israeli political alignment, external pressure a=
nd a realistic alternative to military objectives =E2=80=93 none of which i=
s currently in place.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Of the four imperf=
ect paths, the most likely under current constraints is a tense status quo:=
 low-intensity conflict, gradual force exhaustion and mounting internal str=
ain. Meanwhile, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas will continue calibrated pressure=
 to maintain operations without triggering overwhelming Israeli retaliation=
. Their strategic patience stretches Israel=E2=80=99s capacity on multiple =
fronts, doing nothing to address attrition and offering no decisive militar=
y objective.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For Israel, the pa=
st two years have revealed the limits of a system designed for short wars. =
Manpower is exhausted, economic pressure is mounting and political cohesion=
 is eroding. At the strategic level, the gap between military objectives an=
d capacity is only growing. Without clearly defined end goals, deterrence r=
isks decay, and operations persist without closure.</p>
