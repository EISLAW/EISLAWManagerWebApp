DAILY MEMO: IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS, SYRIAN DIPLOMACY [3]
TEHRAN IS REPORTEDLY CHANGING ITS TONE ON DIRECT TALKS WITH WASHINGTON.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
DIRECT CONTACT. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi asked the U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, to agree to direct talks on Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli news site Ynet
reported [4]. According to the outlet, Tehran has been frustrated with the Oman-mediated negotiations that have been held so far. If direct talks aren’t agreed to, however, Norway could step in as
an alternate broker. Relatedly, Ali Shamkhani, a senior adviser to Iran's supreme leader, said in a social media post [5] that the United States had “finally accepted” the International Atomic
Energy Agency’s assessment that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.
REACHING OUT. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in Paris on Wednesday [6] for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron called for a continuation of Europe’s gradual lifting of
sanctions against Syria and urged the U.S. to hold off on fully withdrawing troops from the country. Al-Sharaa confirmed that Damascus was holding indirect talks with Israel, which has launched
airstrikes in Syria in recent days. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported [7] that al-Sharaa is seeking a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump during Trump’s visit to the Middle East next
week. Syrian officials said al-Sharaa wants to pitch a Marshall Plan-like reconstruction effort that would prioritize U.S. and Western companies' involvement in the Syrian economy over that of Chinese
firms.
ISRAELI WARNINGS. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels [8] that they would face “heavy blows” if they continued to strike Israel. The statement came a day after the
militant group said its truce with Washington did not extend to Israel. Katz also warned Iran [9] that it would be held responsible for attacks launched by its Yemeni proxy.
XI AND PUTIN. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow for a state visit [10] ahead of celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. At a meeting on Thursday with Russian
President Vladimir Putin, Xi touted their willingness to stand up to “bullying on the international stage.” Putin said that energy was the driving force behind their close bilateral relations and
that Moscow would create welcoming conditions for Chinese companies operating in Russia.
MADURO AND PUTIN. Also in Moscow for the Victory Day festivities, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro met with Putin on Wednesday [11]. They discussed bilateral trade cooperation and political and
economic ties, and they signed an agreement on strategic partnership. Putin said trade turnover between the two countries had grown by 64 percent over the past year. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan
Gil Pinto said his country anticipated more Russian investment [12] in energy, food, pharmaceuticals and industry.
U.S.-RUSSIA TIES. Trade turnover between the United States and Russia jumped to $573 million in March from $389.4 million in February, according to figures reported by RIA Novosti [13]. The growth was
attributed to Russian exports (mainly fertilizers, platinum, plywood and phosphates), which rose to $523.5 million from $339.6 million a month earlier, while U.S. exports to Russia remained unchanged
at $50 million.
UKRAINIAN DEBT. Ukraine’s national debt is approaching 100 percent of gross domestic product, Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko said [14]. Before the war, the country's debt-to-GDP ratio was 55
percent. Marchenko added, however, that most of the debt incurred during the war was on preferential terms and that the country does not have to repay the loans in the next 30 years. Ukraine’s
largest external creditor is the European Union, to which it owed $44 billion as of January.
CURRENCY RESET. Ukraine is considering replacing the U.S. dollar with the euro as the reference currency for the hryvnia, Reuters reported [15]. Central bank chief Andriy Pyshnyi said the potential
move reflects Ukraine’s EU aspirations, closer defense ties with Europe and global market volatility. Moldova switched its reference currency from the dollar to the euro in January.
WEAPONS TESTS. North Korea test-fired various types of short-range ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Thursday [16]. According to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the tests likely
included the KN-25 600 mm multiple rocket launcher and the KN-23, similar to Russia’s Iskander short-range ballistic missile. The South Korean military suggested the launches could have been a
performance test for weapons that could be exported to Moscow.
EASING TENSIONS. Turkish and Israeli officials will meet in Azerbaijan for informal talks [17] aimed at easing tensions related to their activities in Syria, Israeli broadcaster Kan 11 reported.
Israel is expected to make two key security demands: the elimination of hostile armed groups near its borders and preventing the deployment of strategic weapons to Syria that could affect Israel’s
national security. Azerbaijan, a long-standing ally of Turkey and a growing partner for Israel, will mediate the talks.
RUSSIA AND LIBYA. The commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, arrived in Moscow on an official visit [18]. While the purpose of the trip has not been
disclosed, it’s likely connected to a visit earlier this week to Moscow by the LNA security chief, Khaled Haftar. According to Italian news agency Agenzia Nova, the earlier meeting resulted in the
signing of a “strategic partnership agreement,” though no details have been released.
FIRST MEETING. France and Germany will create a joint defense and security council, French President Emmanuel Macron announced [19] at a joint press conference with newly elected German Chancellor
Friedrich Merz. The body will be tasked with responding to strategic challenges for both countries.
