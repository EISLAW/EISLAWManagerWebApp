NETANYAHU’S RISKY GREATER ISRAEL PROJECT [3]
IS ISRAEL’S PLAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST ALSO A SPIRITUAL MISSION?
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
During an interview last week with i24 News channel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recounted his recent achievements against Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. He emphasized his role as the main
arbiter and decision maker in Israeli politics and foreign policy. What stood out most, however, were his remarks about Greater Israel. In the segment, the interviewer presented Netanyahu with an
amulet (which did not appear on screen) apparently depicting a map of Greater Israel. Netanyahu said that he felt “very much” connected to the Greater Israel vision and that he believed he was on
a historical and spiritual mission. This article will explore the implications of the Greater Israel project for regional peace, particularly as the Trump administration plans to expand the 2020
Abraham Accords to other hesitant Arab countries.
CHANGING BOUNDARIES
The borders of Greater Israel have repeatedly changed, depending on the opportunities available at any given time. In 1904, Theodor Herzl defined the boundaries of Greater Israel as extending from the
Brook of Egypt (known in Hebrew as Nachal Mitzrayim) to the Euphrates River, which cuts across Syria and Iraq. The term reappeared following the 1967 Six-Day War, when the Likud Party used it as part
of its political platform in the run-up to Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister in 1977. He subsequently began using the biblical name for the West Bank, Judea and Samaria, and promoting
Jewish settlement there. In 2022, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who became leader of the Jewish Home party in 2019, said Israel’s borders should include territories from Syria, Lebanon,
Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a map, allegedly dating back thousands of years, of a Jewish kingdom that included – in
addition to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza – parts of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

Zeev Jabotinsky and Avraham Tehomi’s Irgun paramilitary organization, which operated in Mandatory Palestine from 1931 to 1948, defined historical Palestine, although not necessarily Greater Israel,
as including Transjordan (present-day Jordan). Israel’s founding father and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, believed the borders of the Jewish state would eventually expand beyond those
imposed on it at the time, though not necessarily through war. Netanyahu is now trying to turn Ben-Gurion’s vision into reality.
ISRAELI EXPANSIONISM
In his recent interview, Netanyahu expressed his commitment to the concept of Greater Israel, framing his expansionist policies as a biblical project. He spoke of Greater Israel as a mission passed
down from one generation to the next, and he emphasized that its achievement would unfold in successive stages and began with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Netanyahu believes that
he is on a divine mission to correct past Israeli leaders’ mistakes, including David Ben-Gurion’s failure to expel Palestinians from the newly established state of Israel in 1948, Yitzhak
Rabin’s signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, and Ariel Sharon’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005.
Netanyahu did not define what territories would be included in his definition of Greater Israel. But his recent actions suggest his territorial ambitions go beyond historical Palestine. Since the fall
of the Assad regime in Damascus, Israel has expanded its control over new areas of Syria, particularly the strategically important peak of Mount Hermon and the Yarmouk River basin. The Assad
regime’s demise and Iran’s regional retreat created a strategic vacuum in Syria that Israel immediately took advantage of by destroying Syria’s military arsenal and seizing territory beyond the
1974 ceasefire line. Israel’s declaration of southern Syria as a demilitarized zone encouraged its Druze allies in Sweida province to demand the opening of a supply line linking their areas of
control to the territory dominated by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. This road, known as David’s Corridor, would extend east of the Euphrates River and along Syria’s borders with Jordan
and Iraq. It would transform Syrian geopolitics and enable Israel to further penetrate Syria and northern Iraq. It would also facilitate direct economic ties between the Kurds in Syria and Iraq,
making it possible to lay an oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa. In Lebanon, meanwhile, Israel occupied five strategic heights and expanded the security zone north of the Litani River. It also
threatened to invade Lebanon if fighting with Hezbollah resumed.

Territorial conquest thus lies at the heart of Netanyahu’s vision for a new Middle East. As a result, Israeli expansionism has displaced inhabitants in areas where its influence and assertiveness
are growing, and prevented them from returning to their villages, in preparation for new phases of expansion. Greater Israel cannot be achieved in one fell swoop; it’s a project that will unfold
incrementally over many years.
STRATEGIC PLAN
Some Israeli academics, journalists and retired senior army officers have criticized Netanyahu’s grandiose vision. They have accused him of displaying narcissistic tendencies, including arrogance,
striving for superiority and control, a propensity for assertiveness and competition, as well as a lack of empathy for others. Even Germany, which bears historical guilt regarding the Jewish people
over the Holocaust, rejected the Israeli government’s decision to build thousands of housing units that would separate the northern and southern parts of the West Bank. Spain’s foreign minister
described the housing units as a violation of international law, which considers the West Bank occupied territory – though he stopped short of criticizing the Israeli military for failing to end
settler violence against Palestinians and providing cover for the attacks.
Several Arab countries have denounced Netanyahu’s statement about Greater Israel, saying the project would threaten the sovereignty of other countries in the region. The United Arab Emirates, which
maintained close ties with Israel even before signing the Abraham Accords in 2020, said Netanyahu’s remarks threatened the territorial integrity of several Arab states and undermined the prospects
for peace in the Middle East. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded clarification, saying the comments incited instability and struck an escalatory tone. The Iraqi government noted
Netanyahu’s expansionist tone and said it undermined the region’s security and stability. Saudi Arabia stressed the historical and legal right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent
state.
As Israel seizes the moment and moves toward the fulfillment of a biblical prophecy under Netanyahu, it continues to deny Palestinian national identity. It does not recognize their existence as a
nation with a collective memory. It refuses to negotiate with them, and then labels them terrorists when they revolt. The West sympathized with the Jewish state’s ambition because of the Holocaust,
in which Palestinians played no role. For more than a century, Palestinians have been suffering an unprecedented tragedy, while Zionists have been constructing a national homeland for the Jewish
people, which began with Britain’s issuance of the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Since the 1942 Biltmore Conference, the U.S. has become the primary world power to back the Jewish national project.
Palestinians’ widespread displacement (referred to by Palestinians as the “Nakba”) severed their social relations, transforming them largely into impoverished refugees, cutting them off from
their historical roots and forcing them into an environment of insecurity and hostility. In a leaked recording revealed last week, Israel’s former intelligence chief, Aharon Haliva, said the
extermination of 50,000 Palestinians was “necessary and required for future generations.” He added that 50 Palestinians (regardless of whether they are children or adults) “must die” for every
Israeli lost in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. According to Haliva, Palestinians every now and then “need a Nakba in order to feel the price.”
Israelis suffer from a collective memory of trauma, and so do Palestinians. Whereas the Holocaust has generated worldwide sympathy for the plight of European Jewry, the world has only now started to
come to grips with Palestinian suffering. Even though Israel has risen to become the dominant military power in the Middle East, it cannot win a generational conflict as Netanyahu is promising. In the
14th century, the Crusaders lost interest in conquering Muslim lands after two centuries of war and withdrew from the Middle East, despite having avoided direct defeat. For Israel, balanced peace
remains a better option than venturing into unsustainable conquests, provided the well-being of its future generations matters.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">During an intervie=
w last week with i24 News channel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyah=
u recounted his recent achievements against Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. He e=
mphasized his role as the main arbiter and decision maker in Israeli politi=
cs and foreign policy. What stood out most, however, were his remarks about=
 Greater Israel. In the segment, the interviewer presented Netanyahu with a=
n amulet (which did not appear on screen) apparently depicting a map of Gre=
ater Israel. Netanyahu said that he felt =E2=80=9Cvery much=E2=80=9D connec=
ted to the Greater Israel vision and that he believed he was on a historica=
l and spiritual mission. This article will explore the implications of the =
Greater Israel project for regional peace, particularly as the Trump admini=
stration plans to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords to other hesitant Arab co=
untries.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Changing B=
oundaries</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The borders of Gre=
ater Israel have repeatedly changed, depending on the opportunities availab=
le at any given time. In 1904, Theodor Herzl defined the boundaries of Grea=
ter Israel as extending from the Brook of Egypt (known in Hebrew as Nachal =
Mitzrayim) to the Euphrates River, which cuts across Syria and Iraq. The te=
rm reappeared following the 1967 Six-Day War, when the Likud Party used it =
as part of its political platform in the run-up to Menachem Begin=E2=80=99s=
 election as prime minister in 1977. He subsequently began using the biblic=
al name for the West Bank, Judea and Samaria, and promoting Jewish settleme=
nt there. In 2022, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who became le=
ader of the Jewish Home party in 2019, said Israel=E2=80=99s borders should=
 include territories from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Ara=
bia. Earlier this year, Israel=E2=80=99s Ministry of Foreign Affairs publis=
hed a map, allegedly dating back thousands of years, of a Jewish kingdom th=
at included =E2=80=93 in addition to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza =E2=80=
=93 parts of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Zeev Jabotinsky an=
d Avraham Tehomi=E2=80=99s Irgun paramilitary organization, which operated =
in Mandatory Palestine from 1931 to 1948, defined historical Palestine, alt=
hough not necessarily Greater Israel, as including Transjordan (present-day=
 Jordan). Israel=E2=80=99s founding father and first prime minister, David =
Ben-Gurion, believed the borders of the Jewish state would eventually expan=
d beyond those imposed on it at the time, though not necessarily through wa=
r. Netanyahu is now trying to turn Ben-Gurion=E2=80=99s vision into reality=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Israeli Ex=
pansionism</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In his recent inte=
rview, Netanyahu expressed his commitment to the concept of Greater Israel,=
 framing his expansionist policies as a biblical project. He spoke of Great=
er Israel as a mission passed down from one generation to the next, and he =
emphasized that its achievement would unfold in successive stages and began=
 with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Netanyahu believes =
that he is on a divine mission to correct past Israeli leaders=E2=80=99 mis=
takes, including David Ben-Gurion=E2=80=99s failure to expel Palestinians f=
rom the newly established state of Israel in 1948, Yitzhak Rabin=E2=80=99s =
signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, and Ariel Sharon=E2=80=99s withdrawal =
from the Gaza Strip in 2005.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Netanyahu did not =
define what territories would be included in his definition of Greater Isra=
el. But his recent actions suggest his territorial ambitions go beyond hist=
orical Palestine. Since the fall of the Assad regime in Damascus, Israel ha=
s expanded its control over new areas of Syria, particularly the strategica=
lly important peak of Mount Hermon and the Yarmouk River basin. The Assad r=
egime=E2=80=99s demise and Iran=E2=80=99s regional retreat created a strate=
gic vacuum in Syria that Israel immediately took advantage of by destroying=
 Syria=E2=80=99s military arsenal and seizing territory beyond the 1974 cea=
sefire line. Israel=E2=80=99s declaration of southern Syria as a demilitari=
zed zone encouraged its Druze allies in Sweida province to demand the openi=
ng of a supply line linking their areas of control to the territory dominat=
ed by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. This road, known as David=
=E2=80=99s Corridor, would extend east of the Euphrates River and along Syr=
ia=E2=80=99s borders with Jordan and Iraq. It would transform Syrian geopol=
itics and enable Israel to further penetrate Syria and northern Iraq. It wo=
uld also facilitate direct economic ties between the Kurds in Syria and Ira=
q, making it possible to lay an oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa. In Leban=
on, meanwhile, Israel occupied five strategic heights and expanded the secu=
rity zone north of the Litani River. It also threatened to invade Lebanon i=
f fighting with Hezbollah resumed.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Territorial conque=
st thus lies at the heart of Netanyahu=E2=80=99s vision for a new Middle Ea=
st. As a result, Israeli expansionism has displaced inhabitants in areas wh=
ere its influence and assertiveness are growing, and prevented them from re=
turning to their villages, in preparation for new phases of expansion. Grea=
ter Israel cannot be achieved in one fell swoop; it=E2=80=99s a project tha=
t will unfold incrementally over many years.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Strategic =
Plan</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Some Israeli acade=
mics, journalists and retired senior army officers have criticized Netanyah=
u=E2=80=99s grandiose vision. They have accused him of displaying narcissis=
tic tendencies, including arrogance, striving for superiority and control, =
a propensity for assertiveness and competition, as well as a lack of empath=
y for others. Even Germany, which bears historical guilt regarding the Jewi=
sh people over the Holocaust, rejected the Israeli government=E2=80=99s dec=
ision to build thousands of housing units that would separate the northern =
and southern parts of the West Bank. Spain=E2=80=99s foreign minister descr=
ibed the housing units as a violation of international law, which considers=
 the West Bank occupied territory =E2=80=93 though he stopped short of crit=
icizing the Israeli military for failing to end settler violence against Pa=
lestinians and providing cover for the attacks.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Several Arab count=
ries have denounced Netanyahu=E2=80=99s statement about Greater Israel, say=
ing the project would threaten the sovereignty of other countries in the re=
gion. The United Arab Emirates, which maintained close ties with Israel eve=
n before signing the Abraham Accords in 2020, said Netanyahu=E2=80=99s rema=
rks threatened the territorial integrity of several Arab states and undermi=
ned the prospects for peace in the Middle East. The Egyptian Ministry of Fo=
reign Affairs demanded clarification, saying the comments incited instabili=
ty and struck an escalatory tone. The Iraqi government noted Netanyahu=E2=
=80=99s expansionist tone and said it undermined the region=E2=80=99s secur=
ity and stability. Saudi Arabia stressed the historical and legal right of =
the Palestinian people to establish an independent state.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As Israel seizes t=
he moment and moves toward the fulfillment of a biblical prophecy under Net=
anyahu, it continues to deny Palestinian national identity. It does not rec=
ognize their existence as a nation with a collective memory. It refuses to =
negotiate with them, and then labels them terrorists when they revolt. The =
West sympathized with the Jewish state=E2=80=99s ambition because of the Ho=
locaust, in which Palestinians played no role. For more than a century, Pal=
estinians have been suffering an unprecedented tragedy, while Zionists have=
 been constructing a national homeland for the Jewish people, which began w=
ith Britain=E2=80=99s issuance of the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Since th=
e 1942 Biltmore Conference, the U.S. has become the primary world power to =
back the Jewish national project.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Palestinians=E2=80=
=99 widespread displacement (referred to by Palestinians as the =E2=80=9CNa=
kba=E2=80=9D) severed their social relations, transforming them largely int=
o impoverished refugees, cutting them off from their historical roots and f=
orcing them into an environment of insecurity and hostility. In a leaked re=
cording revealed last week, Israel=E2=80=99s former intelligence chief, Aha=
ron Haliva, said the extermination of 50,000 Palestinians was =E2=80=9Cnece=
ssary and required for future generations.=E2=80=9D He added that 50 Palest=
inians (regardless of whether they are children or adults) =E2=80=9Cmust di=
e=E2=80=9D for every Israeli lost in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. According to =
Haliva, Palestinians every now and then =E2=80=9Cneed a Nakba in order to f=
eel the price.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israelis suffer fr=
om a collective memory of trauma, and so do Palestinians. Whereas the Holoc=
aust has generated worldwide sympathy for the plight of European Jewry, the=
 world has only now started to come to grips with Palestinian suffering. Ev=
en though Israel has risen to become the dominant military power in the Mid=
dle East, it cannot win a generational conflict as Netanyahu is promising. =
In the 14th century, the Crusaders lost interest in conquering Muslim lands=
 after two centuries of war and withdrew from the Middle East, despite havi=
ng avoided direct defeat. For Israel, balanced peace remains a better optio=
n than venturing into unsustainable conquests, provided the well-being of i=
ts future generations matters.</p>
