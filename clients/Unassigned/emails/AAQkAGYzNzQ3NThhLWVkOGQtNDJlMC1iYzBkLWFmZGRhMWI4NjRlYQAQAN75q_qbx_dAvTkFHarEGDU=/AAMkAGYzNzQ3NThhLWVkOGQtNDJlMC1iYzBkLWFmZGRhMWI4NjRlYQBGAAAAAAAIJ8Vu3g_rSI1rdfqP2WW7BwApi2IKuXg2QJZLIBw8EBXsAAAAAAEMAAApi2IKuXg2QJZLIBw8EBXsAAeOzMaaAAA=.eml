AI solved PowerPoint this week, but mostly we slept on it.
Why? Because prompting for powerpoint is THE hardest skill out there in AI.
Harder than for docs. Harder than code. Harder than Excel.=20
That=E2=80=99s because your prompt has to do at least three jobs at once:=
=20
Explain how to tell a story
Set up the data for the story
Explain the visuals
And you have to do all that with an LLM that cannot =E2=80=9Csee=E2=80=9D t=
he way we see. So it=E2=80=99s designing blind. Good luck!
So how did PowerPoint get solved this week?=20
Honestly, with a lot of token burn. Basically, Claude Sonnet 4.5 [ https://=
substack.com/redirect/fd0a9325-dc09-4ac2-a5c7-305d64439ff4?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWti=
OTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] revs the engines and =
goes real hard and checks and re-checks with some obsessive spacing skills =
(I get into the details in the video).
Is it just Sonnet 4.5 that can do this stuff? Nope. Opus 4.1 is pretty good=
=2E And these prompts even help Chat=
GPT-5. I=E2=80=99m not gonna pretend Chat=
GPT is my favorite model for PowerPoint, but the principles scale.
And that brings me to the prompts=E2=80=94what have we got in the box here?=
 Put simply I=E2=80=99m looking to build the prompt pack that really saves =
you days of work a month. I looked it up: we spend about a day a week on av=
erage on decks. Some more, some less (lucky engineers).=20
Well, we don=E2=80=99t have to anymore! I picked the prompts that take out =
a massive chunk of that work=E2=80=94and I explain how they work.
You get:
A deep-dive video explaining WHY prompting is hard and HOW to make AI promp=
t PowerPoint right
An explanation of the five principles of PowerPoint prompting that will wor=
k for ANY AI (not just Claude)=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s basically a PowerPoint =
construction system
A bad prompt breakdown (yes I=E2=80=99m sharing a failed prompt for the fir=
st time!)
A good prompt breakdown (how I fixed that prompt)
16 production grade PowerPoint prompts
4 Foundation Prompts designed to help you teach AI your PowerPoint style
12 production prompts for Marketing, Product, Ops, Executive, and the Board
Handy tips on the hard stuff: how to work your own designs in, where to chu=
nk work, how to handle longer board decks, how to force prompt fidelity, et=
c.
Basically you get everything you need to get you and your team going with P=
owerPoint for AI. And I built it so it=E2=80=99s immediately useful (especi=
ally with Claude), but will become more useful as AI deck intelligence scal=
es out.=20
In a couple of months, everyone will be wrestling with this stuff. And you=
=E2=80=99re gonna have the answers. This is how to tackle the hardest promp=
t problem out there.=20

These four modular prompts form the base system for enterprise deck generat=
ion. The Corporate Style Extractor analyzes an existing PowerPoint and capt=
ures your brand fundamentals=E2=80=94colors, fonts, logo placement, margins=
=E2=80=94as simple JSON. The Corporate Style Applicator takes that JSON and=
 enforces it across new slides while maintaining accessibility and avoiding=
 the design patterns that break (you know, the border boxes we talked about=
). The Enterprise Deck Architect handles planning for complex narratives, t=
aking your messy multi-source inputs and creating the blueprint=E2=80=94sto=
ry structure, slide count, data requirements, all tailored to your specific=
 audience. Finally, Deck Assembly & Validation reviews everything for narra=
tive flow, data consistency, readability, and brand compliance, then gives =
you a concise pass/fail report. Extract style once, apply it everywhere, pl=
an complex decks systematically, validate before you ship.
STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING PROMPTS [ https://substack.com/redirect/ed98749c-=

These prompts plug into your foundation workflow for high-stakes executive =
presentations. You extract and reuse your corporate style JSON once, then y=
ou have three specialized frameworks ready: Board Deck Generator for govern=
ance decisions, Crisis Management Deck for urgent situations requiring clea=
r options and trade-offs, and Quarterly Business Review Builder for regular=
 executive updates. Each prompt specifies what you need upfront (prerequisi=
tes and inputs), gives you the slide structure, enforces brand consistency =
through html2pptx and your style JSON, and works for both simple single-pas=
s decks and complex multi-chunk builds using the architect approach. The em=
phasis throughout is traceable metrics, clear decisions, and actionable out=
comes=E2=80=94because leadership audiences don=E2=80=99t have time for ambi=

These frameworks handle the communication decks that keep organizations ali=
gned. Same setup as before=E2=80=94extract your style JSON once, then you h=

ny-wide updates that balance transparency with strategic direction and actu=

 Card Deck generates sales enablement materials with factual competitor ana=
lysis and objection handling that stays current. Both prompts specify prere=
quisites, inputs, recommended slide structures for different scenarios (bec=
ause a quarterly all-hands is different from a crisis communication), const=
raints that enforce brand consistency via html2pptx, and validation steps t=

Marketing needs to prove ROI and justify budgets, so this framework centers=
 on the Campaign Results Reporter prompt. You extract and reuse your corpor=
ate style JSON following the foundation setup, then this prompt turns multi=
-channel analytics into executive-ready dashboards=E2=80=94ROI analysis, fu=
nnel insights, budget variance tracking, optimization recommendations. The =
guide covers required inputs (because you need actual data, not aspirationa=
l metrics), slide structures for both monthly and quarterly reviews, constr=
aints that enforce brand and data rigor via html2pptx, and audience-specifi=
c considerations. A deck for your CMO emphasizes different things than a de=
ck for the board. The goal is translating marketing results into credible s=
trategy and budget decisions that executives can understand and act on.

Product teams need to communicate roadmaps and coordinate launches, so thes=
e two prompts handle those specific use cases. Extract your style JSON foll=
owing the foundation workflow, then you have Product Roadmap Presentation f=
or visualizing priorities, timelines, resourcing, and success metrics over =
the next six to twelve months, and Product Launch Presentation for coordina=
ting go-to-market across product, marketing, sales, and customer success. E=
ach prompt specifies prerequisites, required inputs (because you need real =
timeline and resource data), slide structures for standard and comprehensiv=
e scenarios, constraints that enforce brand and methodological rigor throug=
h html2pptx, and validation to ensure realistic timelines, clear customer i=
mpact, and measurable outcomes. The emphasis is on presentations that actua=
lly help teams coordinate and make decisions, not just look pretty.
The PowerPoint Prompting Operating Manual: Yes, You Can Actually Do This
I solved AI for PowerPoint. Not =E2=80=9Cit kinda works sometimes=E2=80=9D =
solved=E2=80=94production-ready, enterprise-grade, board-presentation-quali=
ty solved. And I=E2=80=99m going to show you exactly how because this matte=
rs more than you think.
About one-fifth of knowledge work time goes to PowerPoint. Take a day out o=
f your week, that=E2=80=99s PowerPoint. Forty percent of that day is just d=
esign. For a thousand-person company, we=E2=80=99re talking about lifting m=
assive amounts of work that could go to actual thinking instead of slide fo=
rmatting. The economics alone justify figuring this out.
But here=E2=80=99s what I actually learned: PowerPoint forces you to confro=
nt every AI limitation simultaneously=E2=80=94spatial reasoning, visual exe=
cution, data synthesis, narrative coherence. It=E2=80=99s the hardest work =
primitive in regular corporate knowledge work, harder than code or Excel or=
 docs. In those domains AI is already fluent. With PowerPoint you still hav=
e to hold hands. Once you understand why and design around those limits, th=
e system works reliably at scale.
The Five Principles (And Why They Actually Matter)
1. Workflow enforcement unlocks reliability. Right now in October 2025, if =
you=E2=80=99re using Claude for PowerPoint generation, you need to explicit=
ly tell it to use the html2pptx skill. I wish it wasn=E2=80=99t that hacky.=
 I=E2=80=99ve watched Claude admit it didn=E2=80=99t use html2pptx and that=
=E2=80=99s why it couldn=E2=80=99t measure pixel overhang correctly, then w=
atched it use the skill and everything work perfectly.
This reveals something fundamental: AI systems are trained to be helpful, s=
o when they hit technical barriers they silently downgrade to easier approa=
ches without telling you. Claude can=E2=80=99t invoke the PowerPoint skill =
reliably? It=E2=80=99ll switch to document generation logic and do its best=
 to make it look like what you wanted. You won=E2=80=99t know until you ope=
n the file and text is sliding under decorative boxes.
The principle that scales beyond any specific model: you have to discover w=
hich tools work, understand how they work, then build prompts that insist o=
n using them. This is systems thinking once to save boatloads of time forev=
er. (If you=E2=80=99re using ChatGPT or Copilot, you need to figure out the=
ir equivalent skills by talking to the system, then enforce the ones that w=
ork.)
2. Simple visual rules scale better than decoration. Clean typography and s=
pacing produces dramatically more reliable results than fancy borders and c=
ontainers. I learned this watching my early attempts create completely unre=
adable slides=E2=80=94text stacking underneath decorative boxes, black text=
 on navy blue pie charts, ten lines crammed into tiny fonts.
This has profound implications for corporate decks that depend on over-deco=
ration and call it branding. That=E2=80=99s not real branding, and organiza=
tions that redesign for cleaner typography are going to run circles around =
everyone else. Constraint-based design beats decorative specification becau=
se current models can describe what they want to create but execution of co=
mplex visual layouts fails in non-obvious ways. Keep the visual medium clea=
n and you allow the model to focus on expressing sophisticated analysis.
Simple doesn=E2=80=99t mean ugly. The good decks I generated have intention=
al color palettes, subtle gray outlines that actually work, thoughtful colo=
r blocking. They=E2=80=99re better communication tools than the over-design=
ed disasters that fail accessibility requirements.
3. Multi-chat architecture enables complex narratives. Board decks can be f=
orty slides. Try to generate that in one conversation and narrative coheren=
ce degrades=E2=80=94slide 25 contradicts slide 8, style consistency breaks =
down, the model can=E2=80=99t hold the full story arc while executing indiv=
idual components.
The solution: separate planning from execution. One architect chat creates =
the blueprint, generator chats build chunks of five to eight slides each, a=
n assembly chat ensures consistency. This scales to enterprise complexity a=
nd unlocks board-ready crisis decks in hours instead of days.
Why can=E2=80=99t we do it all at once? The visual element consumes tokens =
faster than text or Excel work. The context window gets eaten much quicker =
with PowerPoint. I have to plan for that and deliberately chunk my work. (T=
hat may change, but for now it=E2=80=99s true.) This architecture frees you=
 to focus on the human element=E2=80=94the organizational conflicts you=E2=
=80=99re negotiating, the stakeholder perspectives you=E2=80=99re synthesiz=
ing. Most complex narratives involve organizational conflict anyway. You wa=
nt to spend your time on that negotiation, not on whether bullet points are=
 properly aligned.
4. Iterative prompts build faster than comprehensive ones. I thought compre=
hensive prompts with multiple validation layers would produce better result=
s. Wrong. My eight-page prompt that focused entirely on data synthesis and =
narrative arc produced the disaster deck=E2=80=94text underneath objects, b=
lack on black pie charts, contrast ratios that would fail accessibility req=
uirements. The model could pass every validation step in that prompt and st=
ill create something completely unreadable. Which it did.
What works: establish base template, add data, add synthesis logic, then ad=
d style requirements, each step validated. On smaller decks you can do this=
 in one prompt by telling the model to validate incrementally. On bigger de=
cks these become separate prompts. I=E2=80=99ve watched Claude check itself=
 against my outline requirements, fail its own test, and go back to fix it =
while I drink coffee. Frontier models can self-iterate if you give them the=
 framework.
5. Explicit synthesis logic handles real enterprise data. PowerPoints are n=
arratives about conflicts over data. That means you need to tell AI how to =
reconcile conflicts, validate sources, and synthesize perspectives. Not =E2=
=80=9Cformat this CSV=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Creconcile these three conflicti=
ng financial projections and explain your methodology.=E2=80=9D
Real enterprise data has conflicts, gaps, ambiguities. Prompts that work fo=
r clean toy datasets fall apart with actual complexity=E2=80=94not because =
formatting breaks but because the model needs explicit data processing logi=
c that wasn=E2=80=99t required before. This is one of the great constraints=
 on AI across enterprise work. Your prompts need to expose the data process=
ing logic that used to live in your head and express your intent clearly ab=
out how to resolve the conflicts you know are there.
What Actually Changed Between Bad and Good
The bad prompt was eight pages long and obsessed with data synthesis. Creat=
ive constraints like =E2=80=9Cthe deck must feel like McKinsey crisis consu=
lting but maintain startup urgency=E2=80=9D (what does that even mean visua=
lly?), narrative arc specifications, failure conditions around content. Not=
hing about visual execution.
The good prompt was much shorter and validated entirely different things. I=
t specified the html2pptx workflow explicitly, banned border boxes and outl=
ine shapes and rounded rectangles, asked the model to describe its visual a=
pproach before executing=E2=80=94layout strategy, color palette, typography=
 hierarchy, visual emphasis plan. Then it built in visual validation gates:=
 show thumbnail preview, verify contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 minimum, test re=
adability at different zoom levels, confirm no overlapping elements. The fa=
ilure conditions included visual requirements: any bordered text boxes mean=
s immediate failure and redesign.
The resulting deck looks dramatically better. Simpler slides that are easie=
r to read, better communication tools, still thoughtful in design. Watching=
 the model work reveals why=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s brute forcing through iter=
ations, try it, tweak the header size, try again, adjust spacing, try again=
=2E This is hard for AI too. The reason=
 we humans spend half a day per week o=
n PowerPoint design is because it genuinely is difficult work that requires=
 the combination of analysis (dealing with conflicting data logic) and visu=
al storytelling (getting it into something clean and spatial). That interse=
ction is where current AI capabilities hit their limits.
The New Economics
You can now systematically generate enterprise PowerPoint decks reliably, a=
t scale, with quality that passes executive review. The new workflow: you o=
wn data and narrative requirements, AI generates deck chunks using proven p=
rompts, you review and refine. What took three days now takes an hour, mayb=
e twenty minutes if you have the data ready.
Status reports automated. Sales decks templatized with AI customization for=
 each prospect. Board updates become rapid synthesis exercises where you fo=
cus on message refinement instead of slide formatting. Crisis briefings gen=
erated on the fly instead of requiring all-nighters. Teams without design r=
esources produce polished decks. Subject matter experts create presentation=
s without PowerPoint skills. You have time to iterate on messaging in ways =
you never could before.
The new role: deck architect=E2=80=94someone who understands narrative stru=
cture, data synthesis, and prompt engineering. They build blueprints, AI ex=
ecutes, organizations scale presentation capacity without proportional head=
count.
Why This Actually Matters
The principles I=E2=80=99ve laid out scale beyond any specific model. When =
another system becomes better at PowerPoint generation (and it will), these=
 constraints still apply: workflow enforcement, simple visual rules, multi-=
chat architecture for complexity, iterative validation, explicit synthesis =
logic.
PowerPoint is the hardest work primitive precisely because it combines ever=
ything=E2=80=94spatial reasoning, visual execution, analytical synthesis, n=
arrative coherence. Getting it right required understanding where AI=E2=80=
=99s text capabilities transfer to structured visual outputs and where they=
 don=E2=80=99t, then building systems that play to strengths and compensate=
 for limits.
Once we get this right, we change how stories are told in business settings=
=2E Cleaner PowerPoints, better iterati=
on, humans focusing on storytelling in=
stead of wrestling with alignment and font sizes. The result: enterprise Po=
werPoint generation that actually works. Not experimental. Production-ready=
=2E
Yes, you can do PowerPoint with AI. This is how to do it right.

=E2=80=99t use html2pptx and that=E2=80=99s why it couldn=E2=80=99t measure=
 pixel overhang correctly, then watched it use the skill and everything wor=
k perfectly.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This reveals something fundamental: AI =
systems are trained to be helpful, so when they hit technical barriers they=
 silently downgrade to easier approaches without telling you. Claude can=E2=
=80=99t invoke the PowerPoint skill reliably? It=E2=80=99ll switch to docum=
ent generation logic and do its best to make it look like what you wanted. =
You won=E2=80=99t know until you open the file and text is sliding under de=
corative boxes.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The principle that scales beyond any specif=
ic model: you have to discover which tools work, understand how they work, =
then build prompts that insist on using them. This is systems thinking once=
 to save boatloads of time forever. (If you=E2=80=99re using ChatGPT or Cop=
ilot, you need to figure out their equivalent skills by talking to the syst=
em, then enforce the ones that work.)</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>2. Simple vis=
ual rules scale better than decoration.</strong><span> Clean typography and=
 spacing produces dramatically more reliable results than fancy borders and=
 containers. I learned this watching my early attempts create completely un=
readable slides=E2=80=94text stacking underneath decorative boxes, black te=
xt on navy blue pie charts, ten lines crammed into tiny fonts.</span></p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=
ze: 16px;">This has profound implications for corporate decks that depend o=
n over-decoration and call it branding. That=E2=80=99s not real branding, a=
nd organizations that redesign for cleaner typography are going to run circ=
les around everyone else. Constraint-based design beats decorative specific=
ation because current models can describe what they want to create but exec=
ution of complex visual layouts fails in non-obvious ways. Keep the visual =
medium clean and you allow the model to focus on expressing sophisticated a=
nalysis.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Simple doesn=E2=80=99t mean ugly. The good decks I=
 generated have intentional color palettes, subtle gray outlines that actua=
lly work, thoughtful color blocking. They=E2=80=99re better communication t=
ools than the over-designed disasters that fail accessibility requirements.=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;"><strong>3. Multi-chat architecture enables complex narrati=
ves.</strong><span> Board decks can be forty slides. Try to generate that i=
n one conversation and narrative coherence degrades=E2=80=94slide 25 contra=
dicts slide 8, style consistency breaks down, the model can=E2=80=99t hold =
the full story arc while executing individual components.</span></p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">The solution: separate planning from execution. One architect chat cr=
eates the blueprint, generator chats build chunks of five to eight slides e=
ach, an assembly chat ensures consistency. This scales to enterprise comple=
xity and unlocks board-ready crisis decks in hours instead of days.</p><p s=
tyle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size=
: 16px;">Why can=E2=80=99t we do it all at once? The visual element consume=
s tokens faster than text or Excel work. The context window gets eaten much=
 quicker with PowerPoint. I have to plan for that and deliberately chunk my=
 work. (That may change, but for now it=E2=80=99s true.) This architecture =
frees you to focus on the human element=E2=80=94the organizational conflict=
s you=E2=80=99re negotiating, the stakeholder perspectives you=E2=80=99re s=
ynthesizing. Most complex narratives involve organizational conflict anyway=
. You want to spend your time on that negotiation, not on whether bullet po=
ints are properly aligned.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>4. Iterative prompts bui=
ld faster than comprehensive ones.</strong><span> I thought comprehensive p=
rompts with multiple validation layers would produce better results. Wrong.=
 My eight-page prompt that focused entirely on data synthesis and narrative=
 arc produced the disaster deck=E2=80=94text underneath objects, black on b=
lack pie charts, contrast ratios that would fail accessibility requirements=
. The model could pass every validation step in that prompt and still creat=
e something completely unreadable. Which it did.</span></p><p style=3D"marg=
in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Wha=
t works: establish base template, add data, add synthesis logic, then add s=
tyle requirements, each step validated. On smaller decks you can do this in=
 one prompt by telling the model to validate incrementally. On bigger decks=
 these become separate prompts. I=E2=80=99ve watched Claude check itself ag=
ainst my outline requirements, fail its own test, and go back to fix it whi=
le I drink coffee. Frontier models can self-iterate if you give them the fr=
amework.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>5. Explicit synthesis logic handles real e=
nterprise data.</strong><span> PowerPoints are narratives about conflicts o=
ver data. That means you need to tell AI how to reconcile conflicts, valida=
te sources, and synthesize perspectives. Not =E2=80=9Cformat this CSV=E2=80=
=9D but =E2=80=9Creconcile these three conflicting financial projections an=
d explain your methodology.=E2=80=9D</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=
 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Real enterprise=
 data has conflicts, gaps, ambiguities. Prompts that work for clean toy dat=
asets fall apart with actual complexity=E2=80=94not because formatting brea=
ks but because the model needs explicit data processing logic that wasn=E2=
=80=99t required before. This is one of the great constraints on AI across =
enterprise work. Your prompts need to expose the data processing logic that=
 used to live in your head and express your intent clearly about how to res=
olve the conflicts you know are there.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" =

 deck must feel like McKinsey crisis consulting but maintain startup urgenc=
y=E2=80=9D (what does that even mean visually?), narrative arc specificatio=
ns, failure conditions around content. Nothing about visual execution.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">The good prompt was much shorter and validated entirely differe=
nt things. It specified the html2pptx workflow explicitly, banned border bo=
xes and outline shapes and rounded rectangles, asked the model to describe =
its visual approach before executing=E2=80=94layout strategy, color palette=
, typography hierarchy, visual emphasis plan. Then it built in visual valid=
ation gates: show thumbnail preview, verify contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 mini=
mum, test readability at different zoom levels, confirm no overlapping elem=
ents. The failure conditions included visual requirements: any bordered tex=
t boxes means immediate failure and redesign.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The resulting=
 deck looks dramatically better. Simpler slides that are easier to read, be=

rk reveals why=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s brute forcing through iterations, try i=
t, tweak the header size, try again, adjust spacing, try again. This is har=
d for AI too. The reason we humans spend half a day per week on PowerPoint =

ion of analysis (dealing with conflicting data logic) and visual storytelli=
