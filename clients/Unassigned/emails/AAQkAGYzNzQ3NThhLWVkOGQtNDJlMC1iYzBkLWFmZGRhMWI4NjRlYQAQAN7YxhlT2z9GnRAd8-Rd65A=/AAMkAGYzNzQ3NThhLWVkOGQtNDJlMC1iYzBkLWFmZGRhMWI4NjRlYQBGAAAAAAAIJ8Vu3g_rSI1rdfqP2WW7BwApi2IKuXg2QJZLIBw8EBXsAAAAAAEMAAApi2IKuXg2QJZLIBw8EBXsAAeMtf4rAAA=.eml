If feedback is a gift, why is it so hard to receive? And to give.
It=E2=80=99s because no one taught us how to give feedback.
I was introduced to Jack Cohen [ https://substack.com/redirect/a4217cd6-eb7=

zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], who told me, =E2=80=9CJack i=
s the single biggest influence on my personal productivity and =E2=80=98inn=
er game.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D Over the past 11 years, Jack has coached hundre=
ds of founders, executives, and managers to help them grow themselves and t=
heir colleagues as fast as their startups.
Growth hinges on getting honest and ongoing feedback. Through thousands of =
feedback conversations and hundreds of hours of research, Jack=E2=80=99s de=
veloped an evidence-based, immediately applicable framework for giving feed=
back that he calls GAIN. As Jack puts it, =E2=80=9CGAIN is both a useful ac=
ronym and the core of the philosophy.=E2=80=9D When you tell people what th=
ey stand to gain from the feedback, it suddenly starts feeling like a gift =
again.
This guide is essentially a how-to for Radical Candor, and the most specifi=
c (and easy-to-remember) framework for giving great feedback that you=E2=80=
=99ll find anywhere. It=E2=80=99s going to blow your mind. Enjoy.

Human Systems to Scale Yourself and Your Team Fast [ https://substack.com/r=

ders build their individual operating systems and interpersonal skills to s=
top fighting fires (or each other) and start creating what matters most: gr=
eat products and great teams. For a taste of the course and a demo of both =

, personality type, and culture: giving feedback.
Many people come to coaching and workshops already describing themselves as=
 =E2=80=9Cconflict-averse,=E2=80=9D dreading having difficult conversations=
 and giving direct feedback. A good number arrive fed up with failed attemp=
ts to get people to change their behavior, with many missing the irony as t=
hey bemoan, =E2=80=9CI keep giving them the same feedback, and they never c=
hange. Maybe they just don=E2=80=99t want to.=E2=80=9D
What these folks miss is their own power to catalyze change by shifting the=
 framing and approach of the feedback they give.
I=E2=80=99ve seen and felt firsthand the difference between the =E2=80=9Cfe=
edback masters=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfeedback disasters.=E2=80=9D After eve=
ry feedback conversation from one colleague who I had initially respected, =
I felt deflated. As a result, everything suffered: our product, our relatio=
nship, and my overall well-being.
Later, I worked with another colleague whose feedback left me elated every =
time (actually!). I couldn=E2=80=99t wait for meetings with her because I e=
njoyed them so much and I knew that her feedback would help even my best wo=
rk reach another level.
On reflection, I realized that the content of the feedback from these two c=
olleagues was strikingly similar, but the way my second colleague framed an=
d delivered hers lifted me up instead of shutting me down.
That difference answered an age-old question: How on earth do you get someo=
ne to change or grow? And how can you do that in ways that strengthen your =
connection instead of breaking it? By mastering the art (and science) of gi=
ving great feedback.
The good news is that this is a learnable skill=E2=80=94and one that is cor=
e to my work as an executive coach and organizational behavior consultant.
On a daily basis, I give feedback to clients and help them give feedback to=
 their colleagues, as well as establish effective feedback systems across t=
heir teams and organizations.
At my company, we also practice this in almost every meeting, and the growt=
h it elicits is remarkable. One colleague said that after regularly getting=
 and giving feedback using the GAIN framework, he felt =E2=80=9Cmuch more d=
riven by purpose, rather than by fear.=E2=80=9D
So what is the difference between the feedback masters and disasters? How c=
an you shift your framing and approach to ensure that the feedback you offe=
r inspires people to take action and keep growing? My experience, informed =
by a wealth of research from multiple fields, shows that effective feedback=
 shares several key qualities:
I call this feedback approach the GAIN framework. GAIN is both a useful acr=
onym for remembering these essential ingredients in effective feedback and =
the core of the philosophy.
It is profoundly more effective and inspiring to frame feedback based on th=
e experiences or results we want to move toward (the gain) instead of focus=
ing only on what we want to move away from (the pain).
We can often do this in just a few short sentences. Say an engineering lead=
 is frustrated with a PM=E2=80=99s sloppy handoffs and the resulting delays=
=2E The engineering lead=E2=80=99s feedb=
ack to the PM might sound like: =E2=
=80=9CI want us to reduce handoff friction so we can ship faster. The last =
handoff meeting we had, you didn=E2=80=99t share any background customer re=
search, which I failed to flag at the time. Lacking that context led to mul=
tiple rounds of engineers pinging you with questions instead of making empo=
wered decisions on their own. Can you include that next time?=E2=80=9D
The challenge is that feedback doesn=E2=80=99t typically show up in our bra=
ins in such a crisply articulated, ready-for-prime-time state. It might sta=
rt as =E2=80=9CProduct just threw this over the wall; they don=E2=80=99t ca=
re about our time.=E2=80=9D Or =E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re lazy; they always d=
o this!=E2=80=9D It takes some translating to get our raw reactions into a =
form that=E2=80=99s more likely to have the desired impact (the =E2=80=9Cga=
in=E2=80=9D). That form must include:
What both parties ultimately care about (the Goal)
What needs to change to get there (the Actions)
Why (the Impacts)
Who will do what by when to start making progress (Next actions)
Thinking through the GAIN elements is a powerful way to understand and chan=
nel those raw reactions constructively. This often starts by using your fee=
lings as a clarifying signal pointing to what you really care about, which =
should inform your Goal for the conversation. In cases where your feelings =
are particularly strong or unwieldy, preparation that=E2=80=99s even more f=
ocused on your =E2=80=9Cinner game=E2=80=9D (a topic for a different post) =
becomes an essential step in leveraging the GAIN framework.
Especially with complex or sensitive topics, including each of these GAIN e=
lements in the conversation=E2=80=94often, but not always, in order=E2=80=
=94leads to greater receptivity and, consequently, more behavior change and=
 more satisfying results.
Once my clients understand how GAIN works, they see the ways they themselve=
s have been unintentionally eliciting defensiveness and resistance and how,=
 very practically, they can flip that on its head.
One founder said, =E2=80=9CGAIN helped me have structured conversations tha=
t have proven to be successful especially with =E2=80=98fragile=E2=80=99 te=
am members. I=E2=80=99ve done this successfully with more than five people =
in just the past two weeks.=E2=80=9D
Another client, startup veteran Brian Martin [ https://substack.com/redirec=
t/2ccb4603-8150-468b-81d3-63e8a55dab7b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmL=
QJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], described his experience this way: =E2=
=80=9CAfter I gave feedback once or twice in this new way and saw people ac=
tually listen and change and drive the business results or the behavior tha=
t I was trying to help them toward, I was like, =E2=80=98This is great. I c=
an do this.=E2=80=99 It created a positive feedback loop, and now it=E2=80=
=99s something I just do that I think people really appreciate about me.=E2=
=80=9D
As Brian notes, people start to realize that the function of feedback isn=
=E2=80=99t just for behavior change. When shared with skill and engaged wit=
h vulnerability, a substantive feedback conversation builds immense trust, =
meaningful connection, and deep gratitude. (For example, many [ https://sub=

I=E2=80=99ll walk through a real scenario from a client who applied the fra=
mework within a challenging interpersonal context (with a micromanaging fou=
nder), explaining each =E2=80=9Cmove=E2=80=9D she makes. Then I=E2=80=99ll =
review phrases and principles you can use, and wrap up with three ways AI c=
an help you prepare and master feedback.
But first, where did GAIN come from?
Why GAIN? The evidence behind the framework
GAIN represents the convergence of principles that I encountered in researc=
h across over a dozen diverse domains, ranging from couples therapy to deci=
sion-making to workplace collaboration to teaching, all focused on how to i=
nspire enduring behavior change.
They all orient to the same thesis: Communicating what we all want more of =
(the gain) is more effective than communicating what we want less of (the p=
ain). They don=E2=80=99t say that speaking about pain is bad, just that it=
=E2=80=99s helpful to contextualize it as the gap between where we are and =
where we want to be.
First, let=E2=80=99s look at communication in the most sensitive domain: ma=
rriage. Watching just three minutes of a conversation, marriage researcher =
John Gottman [ https://substack.com/redirect/398525eb-4823-4905-b437-75d52b=
c34b55?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 =
] was able to predict with 93% accuracy which couples would be happy, distr=
essed, or divorced six years down the road; most people, even couples thera=
pists, averaged 50% accuracy [ https://substack.com/redirect/4a5fea4a-47f9-=
4f1c-8b0c-7ad590c172f1?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. How does Gottman distinguish the relationship masters fr=
om the disasters? His meticulous research, filming couples=E2=80=99 conflic=
ts and tracking the couples over years, shows that couples with long-term h=
appy, stable relationships open conflict conversations with more positive a=
nd less negative emotions than doomed ones, especially focusing on sharing =
the =E2=80=9Cdream within the conflict.=E2=80=9D Instead of just complainin=
g, they articulate what it is they want more of and why (the Goal in GAIN).=
 Hearing what you both want more of makes it easier to feel motivated and e=
xcited about the future rather than frustrated about what=E2=80=99s not wor=
king in the present. When 65% of startup failures [ https://substack.com/re=
direct/94f7ab2c-a50e-43dc-8883-7162669e6368?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88Y=
FxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] are attributed to problems within ma=
nagement team dynamics, Gottman=E2=80=99s relationship research is also wor=
th paying attention to at work.
The GAIN framing not only leads to behavior change, it can also elicit bett=
er decisions. One study [ https://substack.com/redirect/3df20c98-866a-4c9c-=
b3ca-f22d7684825c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ] by Amos Tversky and colleagues showed that doctors given data =
with an avoid framing (=E2=80=9CThe mortality rate is 10%=E2=80=9D) made th=
e most effective treatment decision only 50% of the time, whereas those wit=
h the same inputs but using an approach framing (=E2=80=9CThe survival rate=
 is 90%=E2=80=9D) made the most effective decision 84% of the time. The mea=
ning of the framing is identical (10% rate of mortality is the same as 90% =
rate of survival), but the avoid framing and its threat mindset distort our=
 ability to think and process information clearly. This is precisely the ab=
ility we want people to be engaging when receiving feedback and considering=
 a change in behavior.
This dynamic plays out elsewhere in the workplace as well (and in a way I k=
eep thinking about as leaders fret over AI adoption strategies). Amy Edmons=
on=E2=80=99s research [ https://substack.com/redirect/99798f30-60d9-49ff-94=

me new technology. She showed that teams whose leaders pitched it using an =
=E2=80=9Caspirational=E2=80=9D framing (e.g. =E2=80=9CThis will help patien=
ts recuperate faster=E2=80=9D) were far more effective than those using a =
=E2=80=9Cdefensive=E2=80=9D framing (e.g. =E2=80=9CThe reason for doing thi=
s . . . is to avoid being blindsided by competitive pressures in the future=
=E2=80=9D). The successful leaders not only emphasized what to move toward,=
 they also framed getting there as a team effort.
Our brains are engaged in a constant calculus: approach or avoid, friend or=
 foe? When we frame a conversation with the potential benefits of change an=
d acknowledge what we need to change ourselves, it sends a strong approach =
signal=E2=80=94a powerful =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re on the same team=E2=80=9D =
message=E2=80=94to the other party. They are then more likely to hear it as=
 =E2=80=9CHey, this information can be really useful to me, and I want to h=
elp this person too.=E2=80=9D
To explore what all this theory looks like in a real feedback conversation,=
 see the case of one of my clients below.
GAIN in the real world: Giving feedback to a micromanaging founder
Laura is a VP of Business Development at a high-growth startup, where she r=
eports to a founder who practiced micromanagement like it was her religion.=
 Unsurprisingly, this was quite frustrating for Laura. It would have been t=
empting to approach this challenge by telling the founder how deflating thi=
s experience was and asking her to change (or by just avoiding the conversa=
tion altogether, growing resentful over time, and eventually looking for an=
other job). Instead, Laura processed her own raw reaction first, using her =
emotions to uncover what she actually wanted to get out of a feedback conve=
rsation: the founder to give her more space. Laura understood Gottman=E2=80=
=99s =E2=80=9Cdream within a conflict=E2=80=9D principle, so when the found=
er was complaining to her yet again about other teams=E2=80=94this time the=
 sales team=E2=80=94Laura seized the moment.
When she began the conversation, she named the founder=E2=80=99s actions an=
d the impacts that mattered to the founder, and empathized with her on thos=
e points. Then, instead of dwelling on the founder=E2=80=99s pain or going =
into her own, Laura turned toward the possible goal for the founder, emphas=
izing the benefits for the founder in a way that aligned with her own goal.=
 (GAIN conversations don=E2=80=99t have to present the goal first to be eff=
ective, as long as they are in the spirit of GAIN and the goal is clarified=
 soon after.) Finally, she guided the conversation toward next actions that=
 would accomplish both of their goals.
Here=E2=80=99s how she masterfully led the conversation, as she reported it=
 to me:
Actions and Impacts: =E2=80=9CRight now, I can see you are on every sales c=
all, email, in all of the Slack channels across every team, and I can only =
imagine how exhausting that must be.
I imagine that you feel like you have to do it because you feel the job won=
=E2=80=99t get done unless you do.=E2=80=9D
Goal: =E2=80=9CI think there might be another approach here that could crea=
te more time for you to focus on the areas where your impact is greatest an=
d, at the same time, help the team step up, do better work, and feel more m=
otivated. It could even reduce some of the stress and burnout you were talk=
ing about.=E2=80=9D
The founder responded honestly, =E2=80=9CI know, I know, and I want to fix =
it. But I just don=E2=80=99t see any other way of doing things, and I don=
=E2=80=99t see the sales team getting the results.=E2=80=9D
A feedback opening line is an invitation, and Laura=E2=80=99s was so inviti=
ng, the founder accepted and immediately engaged with it. The response, tho=
ugh brief, revealed lots of useful information: the founder=E2=80=99s desir=
e to change, the obstacle to that change, and what matters most to her=E2=
=80=94getting results. Laura can leverage this to move the dialogue forward=
 toward her desired outcomes.
Next, Laura took her founder=E2=80=99s concern seriously and engaged her fu=
rther, asking more questions that invite the founder to reflect more deeply=
 on the obstacle she=E2=80=99s raising while emphasizing the importance of =
trust:
=E2=80=9CIf that=E2=80=99s the case, do you have the right people? If you c=
an=E2=80=99t trust people to do the work, are they the right people?=E2=80=
=9D
=E2=80=9CYeah,=E2=80=9D the founder said, =E2=80=9CI think that=E2=80=99s t=
he bigger question=E2=80=94the thing I need to think about.=E2=80=9D
Having built a sense of =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m on your team=E2=80=9D in the c=
onversation, Laura continued and challenged her:
=E2=80=9CThe interesting thing is, though, I know you trust me a lot=E2=80=
=94you=E2=80=99ve mentioned it, and I=E2=80=99ve even observed it=E2=80=94b=
ut you still sometimes do it with me.=E2=80=9D
Here, Laura doesn=E2=80=99t judge or criticize; she just references her obs=
ervation of the founder=E2=80=99s pattern of actions (participating in all =
calls, emails, Slack channels), as well as the exceptions to that pattern (=
=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99ve mentioned [your trust in me], and I=E2=80=99ve even=
 observed it=E2=80=9D).
The founder acknowledged, =E2=80=9CI know. It=E2=80=99s just my way; I=E2=
=80=99m so used to doing it. I get everything done myself. I push, push, pu=
sh.=E2=80=9D
So Laura asked, =E2=80=9CWhat would be more helpful for you, so you don=E2=
=80=99t have to do that?=E2=80=9D
Instead of solely focusing on what the founder can do differently, Laura=E2=
=80=99s question broadens the possible levers for change to include herself=
 and others. Some people are wary that this approach might mean less accoun=
tability for the feedback recipient, letting them off the hook. Rather, mor=
e levers means more leverage to get what we want.
Next actions: The founder replied, =E2=80=9CI really appreciate when you pr=
oactively send me updates=E2=80=94which I know you already do. But also, yo=
u can just tell me when I=E2=80=99m doing it.=E2=80=9D
Laura confirmed: =E2=80=9CSounds great. So moving forward, I=E2=80=99ll con=
tinue proactively sending you updates, you=E2=80=99ll work on stepping back=
=E2=80=94i.e. not jumping in or pinging me with status checks=E2=80=94and I=
=E2=80=99ll name it in the moment if the old pattern rears its head.=E2=80=
=9D
These are clear, concrete actions that they can both take to change the fee=
dback recipient=E2=80=99s pattern of checking in unnecessarily. The founder=
 conveyed her intent to stop while also acknowledging her imperfection and =
inviting Laura to help her make this change=E2=80=94which was particularly =
empowering given the power dynamic.
The improvement took time to sink in, though Laura felt full agency to help=
 move it forward. A month later, she shared that the founder had reverted t=
o micromanagement mode three times that week, but then stopped after Laura =
told her when she would send an update. Over time, the micromanaging patter=
n ceased almost completely, and not only that; Laura told me that she felt =
newly confident in her ability to initiate challenging conversations.
Laura navigated a tough dynamic with someone holding greater organizational=
 power and emerged with both the founder=E2=80=99s commitment to change and=
 an invitation to support that change=E2=80=94while building her own confid=
ence and skills.
GAIN feedback principles and phrases
This example models both the practical steps of the GAIN framework and the =
spirit of it: care and challenge, offering empathy and expressing what the =
feedback giver wants=E2=80=94in that order.

he lens of GAIN, though her goal comes in the third sentence, not the first=

Let=E2=80=99s dive into the nuances and some helpful phrases and principles=
 you can consider, drawing on Laura=E2=80=99s example and others.
G: The Goal
The essence of the Goal section is naming the topic and pointing to the pos=
sible benefits of making a change in such a way that they feel you=E2=80=99=
re on their team.
These benefits can be for you too, but they must be appealing to the feedba=
ck recipient. This is not what you want them to do differently; it=E2=80=99=
s the impact created by them doing it. What will they gain from making a ch=
ange?
If they understand that motivation up front, they=E2=80=99re hooked, and ev=
erything else flows from there.
What struck me most in the way Laura shared her feedback is that it didn=E2=
=80=99t sound like a complaint or criticism at all. Instead, she shared it =
in a way that genuinely came across as a desirable opportunity for both the=
 founder and her. She mentioned the current pain but oriented to the possib=
le gain, =E2=80=9Cthe dream within the conflict=E2=80=9D that Gottman=E2=80=
=99s research showed to be so effective.
Here are a few ways to approach this.
If you can find even one instance of someone already using the desired beha=
vior, it will help them recognize what that looks and feels like. Further, =
they will feel more confident in their ability to act in that way. The impa=
ct of that behavior serves as the Goal for the feedback.
=E2=80=9CEven more=E2=80=9D conveys that they both have some foundations to=
 build on and that they=E2=80=99re not there yet.
Sometimes it=E2=80=99s important to emphasize the =E2=80=9Cnot yet,=E2=80=
=9D the gap between where performance is now and where it needs to be. In t=
hose cases, we must offer both challenge and support. These qualities are u=
sually understood as opposites (=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m either extremely hones=
t or extremely caring=E2=80=9D), but that is a misconception.
One randomized, double-blind controlled study [ https://substack.com/redire=
ct/56eaba63-d501-4b75-963b-1ee9c845dbea?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPm=
LQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] from Stanford tested the impact of integ=
rating these two qualities using the sentence =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m giving y=
ou these comments because I have very high expectations [challenge] and I k=
now that you can reach them [support].=E2=80=9D Compared with a placebo=E2=
=80=94=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m giving you these comments so that you=E2=80=99ll=
 have feedback on your paper=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the first sentence more than =
quadrupled the number of revisions to the original work that one group of s=
tudents did, and the revisions themselves were on average 26% better.
Each of the phrases above can engage people=E2=80=99s interest in the conve=
rsation, but the key is that it be an actual conversation=E2=80=94a dialogu=
e, not a monologue. One of the most common mistakes I see people make is de=
livering feedback instead of exploring it together.
The point is not you giving the feedback; it=E2=80=99s them getting it=E2=
=80=94and ideally, you getting some insights too. In this way, communicatio=
n is like a game of catch: the other person needs to actually receive and h=
ear the feedback in order for the game to be successful. GAIN largely focus=
es on throwing better so it=E2=80=99s easier for them to catch whatever you=
=E2=80=99re throwing, but ultimately, effective communication is an alterna=
ting rhythm of throwing and catching.
You can initiate this rhythm by pausing routinely and asking a question tha=
t elicits their reflections, reactions, and their own feedback for you. Thi=
s creates two benefits: (1) it can reveal what message they are actually ge=
tting, giving you the opportunity to clarify immediately if needed, and (2)=
, equally important, it can expand your understanding of root causes, revea=
ling blind spots you may have (and keeping you from putting your foot in yo=
ur mouth).
Especially if you=E2=80=99re not clear yet on why they would care or what t=
heir goal is, listen before you talk.
A & I: Actions & Impacts
It=E2=80=99s not just the goal that determines receptivity or defensiveness=
=2E The most common move I see that lea=
ds people to put up their shields is h=
earing critical judgments. They=E2=80=99re an almost guaranteed way to trig=
ger people and derail the conversation.
Feedback is effective when it=E2=80=99s actionable. To make it actionable i=
nstead of objectionable, feedback masters share observations of people=E2=
=80=99s actions and their impacts, not judgments. =E2=80=9CResponse times t=
o client emails averaged 4.2 days last month=E2=80=9D lands very differentl=
y than =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re being unprofessional.=E2=80=9D
Even if this seems obvious, it becomes challenging when we=E2=80=99re annoy=
ed and feeling justified in our annoyance (=E2=80=9CProduct just threw this=
 over the wall; they don=E2=80=99t care about our time!=E2=80=9D). Our judg=
ments feed our emotions [ https://substack.com/redirect/77cd2eec-e543-4461-=

tAjMRMPOw0 ], which then amplify our judgments.
And what seems straightforward in theory can be deceptively difficult in th=
e face of real-world situations. In over 50 feedback workshops across dozen=
s of tech companies, I=E2=80=99ve asked people to share real-world feedback=
 examples, and there hasn=E2=80=99t been a single workshop in which everyon=
e agreed on whether every example we talked through was a judgment or obser=
vation.
Fortunately, recognizing and translating our judgments is a skill easily de=
veloped with practice, one even more easily practiced now with AI. To do so=
, you can use this custom GPT [ https://substack.com/redirect/8bab3eef-7326=
-4859-bc05-d8c9dd1e18cf?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnP=
G6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] or just input this prompt:
Give me examples to practice identifying whether something is an observatio=
n or a judgment. Explain why I=E2=80=99m right or wrong after I answer, the=
n give another example, making them increasingly ambiguous each time.
There=E2=80=99s a strong correlation here: the more clearly we see what is =
impacting progress, the more quickly we can identify new strategies to move=
 toward our Goal.
Laura never called it =E2=80=9Cmicromanagement=E2=80=9D to the founder. She=
 didn=E2=80=99t even use the word =E2=80=9Cfeedback=E2=80=9D; she just desc=
ribed the actions and their effects as she observed them.
This gets to the essence of feedback as I define it: creating visibility in=
to people=E2=80=99s actions and their impacts. Simple cause and effect is a=
 line of sight that the actor often lacks. Often, not only do we lack visib=
ility into how we are impacting others; we lack the ability to step back fr=
om and see our own behavior.
Avoid flattering judgments too
Even for well-practiced feedback masters, it can be tempting to deploy crit=
ical judgment=E2=80=99s close cousin, flattering judgment. Well-intentioned=
 people might offer praise and compliments, like =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re a =
rockstar PM=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re so brilliant. You have such=
 a gift,=E2=80=9D to motivate or thank colleagues. But just as critical jud=
gments can trigger defensiveness, flattering ones can destroy growth mindse=
t, autonomy, and productivity, and foster people-pleasing.
The =E2=80=9Crockstar PM=E2=80=9D worries about maintaining that image if s=
he fails, turning challenges into threats rather than opportunities to lear=
n and grow. Carol Dweck=E2=80=99s mindset research [ https://substack.com/r=

YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] explains why: If the cause of my su=
ccess is my brilliance, what does that imply about the cause of my potentia=
l failures? This is especially pernicious in contexts that require experime=
ntation, where failure=E2=80=94however temporary=E2=80=94is inevitable. Thi=
s dynamic is exacerbated when the flattering judgments come from a manager =
or executive.
That rockstar PM=E2=80=99s focus reorients from iteration and impact to see=
king approval.

By contrast, observations of people=E2=80=99s actions and impacts point the=

ep doing and the potential impacts of those actions. They see how to increa=

Acknowledge your own actions and their impacts
Judgments aren=E2=80=99t the only trigger for defensiveness. When you as th=
e feedback giver have contributed to a situation but you aren=E2=80=99t not=
ing that, the recipient=E2=80=99s attention can latch onto this gap. =E2=80=
=9CYeah, but what about your actions?=E2=80=9D they wonder. You can preempt=
 this reaction by simply and directly acknowledging your contribution.
As a social species, humans unconsciously mirror the behavior we see in oth=
ers around us. The crowd waits at a light, and so do we; we start jaywalkin=
g, and others are more likely to as well. This plays out interpersonally to=
o. Far too often, we approach feedback conversations with the implicit atti=
tude of =E2=80=9CYou are the one who needs to change.=E2=80=9D From this an=
gle, it=E2=80=99s no surprise that what we get back is the other person loo=
king at us thinking, =E2=80=9CNo, you are the one who needs to change.=E2=
=80=9D We tend to get what we give.
But this human instinct is actually good news: if you want to lead a conver=
sation and a relationship in a specific direction, just start moving in tha=
t direction yourself. The message switches to =E2=80=9CI think we can both =
shift some things that will make it easier to change and move toward that G=
oal.=E2=80=9D
This is one of most disarming feedback approaches I=E2=80=99ve ever encount=
ered=E2=80=94and one of the least-used. Once we have acknowledged our contr=
ibution and shown that we are monitoring our own behavior, the other person=
 can release their focus on our actions, freeing up their attention to conc=
entrate on their own actions.
There=E2=80=99s an added benefit here for the feedback giver: shifts that I=
 make in one relationship often apply to other relationships too. When I wa=
s frustrated with one client constantly rescheduling, I realized how I was =
contributing to and even encouraging the problem by always saying yes to re=
quests. Quick check-ins with all my clients around minimizing changes dropp=
ed rescheduling requests to zero across the board. More levers, more levera=
ge.
N: Next actions
What do we do with those levers we identified? Once feedback has been share=
d and received, the final step in an effective feedback conversation is def=
ining next actions. These could be actions for the feedback recipient, the =
feedback giver, or both.
The clearer and more concrete our action-and-impact observations are, the m=
ore obvious the potential next actions become.
Sometimes it=E2=80=99s a very direct link: =E2=80=9CHey, when you don=E2=80=
=99t schedule interviews in the time frame you said you would, it slows dow=
n our hiring process. Can you schedule those this week and let me know if t=
here are any blockers?=E2=80=9D
Other times, arriving at next actions is more complex and uncomfortable. Ou=
r insides are screaming, =E2=80=9CThis conversation is awkward. Get me out =
of here already!=E2=80=9D But even an otherwise-great feedback conversation=
 will often amount to nothing if we don=E2=80=99t close it clearly and conc=
retely.
There are a few ways of doing this that increase buy-in and follow-through.
First, ask for their ideas
In an often-maddening phenomenon, people will resist change that they thems=
elves want if it appears to come at the expense of their autonomy. We may w=
ant to change, but we want to choose it.
One simple way of supporting someone=E2=80=99s sense of autonomy is to ask =
for their ideas of what to change before offering our own. When the other p=
erson is really on board with the Goal and open to hearing what we=E2=80=99=
ve shared, given even a few moments of brainstorming, I have found that the=
y regularly come up with useful options I had not considered. They also ten=
d to be more motivated to pursue ideas they have generated themselves.
For feedback that is difficult to hear regardless of how it=E2=80=99s share=
d, a feedback conversation might actually be a series of conversations, so =
it=E2=80=99s often best to sleep on it and schedule a future time to return=
 and commit to next actions (not just =E2=80=9Clater=E2=80=9D).
Co-create through brainstorming together
If you are itching to share your own idea but also want to involve them, th=
is option opens up the opportunity for both. It also lets you build on each=
 other=E2=80=99s ideas.
Make specific requests=E2=80=94and make it easy to say no
Sometimes asking for the other person=E2=80=99s ideas can feel disingenuous=
 when all you want is to propose your own. In that case, share your idea, a=
nd offer it as a suggestion or a request in a way that still honors their a=
utonomy=E2=80=94in other words, not as a demand.
To support this feeling, make it easy for them to say no to or edit the req=
uest. A meta-analysis [ https://substack.com/redirect/0e189fd9-fa7b-40c2-a1=
08-c17f1fa0cac6?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tA=
jMRMPOw0 ] of 52 studies showed that =E2=80=9CFeel free to say no=E2=80=9D =
doubled the percentage of time that people said yes to a request. Supportin=
g autonomy conveys real respect, which preempts resistance, engenders goodw=
ill, and helps people think clearly about the suggestion on its own merits.=
 If they actually say no, you will get to learn what=E2=80=99s blocking the=
m and how to incorporate that in the next actions. (And if you=E2=80=99re f=
eeling attached to your idea and actually want to demand it, remember that =
it=E2=80=99s the Goal you care about, not the way they get there.)
It=E2=80=99s also important to ensure that your specific request includes w=
hat you want more of, not just less of. As psychologist Marshall Rosenberg,=
 the author of Nonviolent Communication, said, =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t d=
o a don=E2=80=99t.=E2=80=9D Otherwise, when they find themselves in the sam=
e situation again, they=E2=80=99ll be unclear about what alternative behavi=
or to engage in.
Frame it as an experiment
When someone is considering a new behavior, that means there=E2=80=99s an e=
lement of uncertainty. Understandably, there can be some hesitance about co=
mmitting to do something they=E2=80=99ve never done before, no matter how m=
uch they follow the logic. Instead of committing to something new =E2=80=9C=
forever,=E2=80=9D explicitly acknowledge it as an experiment for a set time=
 period.
WWW: Who will do What by When?
This question moves growth, progress, and whole companies forward faster th=
an any other one I know.
=E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cshould=E2=80=9D are insidious =
impostors when it comes to action items. Let=E2=80=99s: Is that you or me? =
Should: Is that an idea we=E2=80=99re considering or a commitment? When you=
 hear these words, use them as an automatic signal to pause and clarify who=
 will do what by when.
Schedule a check-in
If you don=E2=80=99t set a clear check-in, you run the risk of not seeing t=
he change you were hoping for and having to initiate a follow-up feedback c=
onversation if you still want to close the gap. The discomfort of this is h=
igher, so it=E2=80=99s easier to avoid, and the frustration festers into re=
sentment and helplessness. If instead you establish a time and date to chec=
k in, you set up three more desirable possibilities:
An agreed-upon check-in time often increases the accountability and expecta=
tion of change.
The behavior may have changed, and you have a built-in moment to appreciate=
 the impacts you=E2=80=99re seeing and the progress toward the Goal, encour=
aging even more development. This reinforces a growth mindset.
If the behavior hasn=E2=80=99t changed or hasn=E2=80=99t had the desired im=
pact, you will recognize this sooner and be able to troubleshoot and course=
-correct faster.
AI in feedback
That=E2=80=99s a lot to digest and consider when preparing and leading a fe=
edback conversation. Fortunately, you=E2=80=99re not on your own anymore.

ed an evidence-based, immediately applicable framework for giving feedback =
that he calls </span><strong>GAIN</strong><span>. As Jack puts it, =E2=80=
=9CGAIN is both a useful acronym and the core of the philosophy.=E2=80=9D W=
hen you tell people what they</span><em> </em><span>stand to gain from the =
feedback, it suddenly starts feeling like a gift again.</span></p><p style=

ecific (and easy-to-remember) framework for giving great feedback that you=
=E2=80=99ll find anywhere. It=E2=80=99s going to blow your mind. Enjoy.</p>=

ck. A good number arrive fed up with failed attempts to get people to chang=
e their behavior, with many missing the irony as they bemoan, =E2=80=9CI ke=

 framing and approach of the feedback they give.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=
 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I=E2=80=99=
ve seen and felt firsthand the difference between the =E2=80=9Cfeedback mas=
ters=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfeedback disasters.=E2=80=9D After every feedbac=
k conversation from one colleague who I had initially respected, I felt def=
lated. As a result, everything suffered: our product, our relationship, and=
 my overall well-being.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Later, I worked with another collea=
gue whose feedback left me elated every time (actually!). I couldn=E2=80=99=
t wait for meetings with her because I enjoyed them so much and I knew that=
 her feedback would help even my best work reach another level.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">On reflection, I realized that the content of the feedback from these =
two colleagues was strikingly similar, but the way my second colleague fram=
ed and delivered hers lifted me up instead of shutting me down.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">That difference answered an age-old question: How on earth do you get =
someone to change or grow? And how can you do that in ways that strengthen =
your connection instead of breaking it? By mastering the art (and science) =
of giving great feedback.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The good news is that this is a l=
earnable skill=E2=80=94and one that is core to my work as an executive coac=
h and organizational behavior consultant.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">On a daily basis,=
 I give feedback to clients and help them give feedback to their colleagues=
, as well as establish effective feedback systems across their teams and or=
ganizations.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">At my company, we also practice this in almost=
 every meeting, and the growth it elicits is remarkable. One colleague said=
 that after regularly getting and giving feedback using the GAIN framework,=
 he felt =E2=80=9Cmuch more driven by purpose, rather than by fear.=E2=80=
=9D</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">So what is the difference between the feedback masters =
and disasters? How can you shift your framing and approach to ensure that t=
he feedback you offer inspires people to take action and keep growing? My e=
xperience, informed by a wealth of research from multiple fields, shows tha=
t effective feedback shares several key qualities:</p><div class=3D"caption=

ements is a powerful way to understand and channel those raw reactions cons=
tructively. This often starts by using your feelings as a clarifying signal=
 pointing to what you really care about, which should inform your Goal for =

nwieldy, preparation that=E2=80=99s even more focused on your =E2=80=9Cinne=

y telling the founder how deflating this experience was and asking her to c=
hange (or by just avoiding the conversation altogether, growing resentful o=

 her own raw reaction first, using her emotions to uncover what she actuall=

ch of the phrases above can engage people=E2=80=99s interest in the convers=
ation, but the key is that it be an actual conversation=E2=80=94a dialogue,=

them getting it=E2=80=94and ideally, you getting some insights too. In this=
 way, communication is like a game of catch: the other person needs to actu=
ally receive and hear the feedback in order for the game to be successful. =
GAIN largely focuses on throwing better so it=E2=80=99s easier for them to =
catch whatever you=E2=80=99re throwing, but ultimately, effective communica=

 can initiate this rhythm by pausing routinely and asking a question that e=
licits their reflections, reactions, and their own feedback for you. This c=
reates two benefits: (1) it can reveal what message they are actually getti=
ng, giving you the opportunity to clarify immediately if needed, and (2), e=
qually important, it can expand your understanding of root causes, revealin=
g blind spots you may have (and keeping you from putting your foot in your =
mouth).</p><div class=3D"captioned-image-container-static" style=3D"font-si=

species, humans unconsciously mirror the behavior we see in others around u=
s. The crowd waits at a light, and so do we; we start jaywalking, and other=
s are more likely to as well. This plays out interpersonally too. Far too o=
ften, we approach feedback conversations with the implicit attitude of =E2=

 I=E2=80=99ve ever encountered=E2=80=94and one of the least-used. Once we h=

up their attention to concentrate on their own actions.</p><p style=3D"marg=

ke in one relationship often apply to other relationships too. When I was f=
rustrated with one client constantly rescheduling, I realized how I was con=
tributing to and even encouraging the problem by always saying yes to reque=
sts. Quick check-ins with all my clients around minimizing changes dropped =
rescheduling requests to zero across the board. More levers, more leverage.=
