eed for curated, thoughtful content as an antidote to the endless slop fill=

To continue building an essential reading library for product leaders, I=E2=
=80=99ve picked 10 more timeless reads that you probably haven=E2=80=99t re=
ad but should. This includes a handful that popped into my mind after I pub=
lished part 1, suggestions you sent me, and a few honorary mentions for ext=
ra credit. The pieces below cover a wide spectrum of advice around growth, =
leadership, communication, entrepreneurship, and more.
I=E2=80=99m not including books here=E2=80=94that list is yet to come. If y=
ou have suggestions for essays I=E2=80=99m still sleeping on, please share =
them in the comments. =F0=9F=99=8F

=E2=80=9CA product succeeds because it solves a problem for people. This so=
unds very basic, but it is the single most important thing to understand ab=
out building good products.
The first step in building something new is understanding what problem you =
want to solve, and for whom. This should be crystal clear before you start =
thinking about any solutions.
The second question you should ask yourself is =E2=80=98Why is this particu=
lar problem worth solving?=E2=80=99
If the audience you are building for is narrowly defined (and one that you =
are a part of), then you may be able to rely on your intuition to guide you=
r product decision-making. If not, then you should rely on research and dat=
a to inform your decisions.
If you are a start-up founder, your path will be easier if you go after a p=
roblem for a narrowly defined audience, and then expand to broader audience=
s after you have some initial traction.
The problem you=E2=80=99re trying to solve should be easy to communicate in=
 a sentence or two and resonate with someone from your target audience. If =
not, consider that a big red flag.=E2=80=9D
2. Communication Is the Job [ https://substack.com/redirect/c7d529b9-b961-4=

=E2=80=9CWhen I=E2=80=99m doing a poor job of communicating it can feel lik=
e I=E2=80=99m pushing with a rope. I have some clear vision in my head and =
people just aren=E2=80=99t doing what I expect. It can be a frustrating exp=
erience and it is tempting to blame the audience for not understanding. But=
 make no mistake, when this happens, it is your fault. You have to sit down=
 and ask questions from a place of humility to hear what they took away fro=
m what you said. Take full responsibility for any discrepancy from what you=
 intended and make corrections with your entire audience.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CThe best executive communication starts with =E2=80=98Situation.=
=E2=80=99 The nickname for this is SCQA, or the Pyramid Principle.
The best executive communication starts with the state of affairs. It=E2=80=
=99s fact-based, unambiguous. It=E2=80=99s totally not controversial. No ma=
tter what side of an issue or a hard choice you=E2=80=99re on, you should b=
e able to read the situation and go, =E2=80=98That pretty much sums it up.=
=E2=80=99 Whether you=E2=80=99re on one side or another of an issue, it doe=
sn=E2=80=99t matter. You should read the situation and agree to it. Agree t=
hat=E2=80=99s fair.
The next thing that comes out is the complication. A crisp, short statement=
 about what has changed or what=E2=80=99s making things harder. What=E2=80=
=99s changed, what=E2=80=99s making things harder? The question, the =E2=80=
=98Q,=E2=80=99 falls automatically out of =E2=80=98S=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98=
C=E2=80=99 and it=E2=80=99s almost always =E2=80=98What should we do?=E2=80=
=99 You can save yourself a lot of anxiety if you=E2=80=99re trying to prac=
tice this. If you get hung up on =E2=80=98Q,=E2=80=99 it=E2=80=99s almost a=
lways =E2=80=98What should we do?=E2=80=99=20
=E2=80=98Answer,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98A,=E2=80=99 answer first at the top of a=
 pyramid. Pyramid-shape your evidence underneath it, and it has to resolve =
the complication 100%. [=E2=80=A6] Every conversation in [your] life is an =
opportunity to SCQA. Friends, loved ones, pets, conversations at the deli c=
ounter, everything.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhen I ask new entrepreneurs what their distribution model will be=
, I often get answers like: =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t want to hire any of th=
ose Rolex-wearing, BMW-driving, overly aggressive enterprise sales slimebal=
ls, so we are going to distribute our product like Dropbox did.=E2=80=99 In=
 addition to taking stereotyping to a whole new level, this answer demonstr=
ates a deep misunderstanding of how sales channels should be designed.
What is a sales channel? It=E2=80=99s a route to market for a product or se=
t of products. It can range from your website to a sophisticated sales forc=
e. The sale itself must be supported with the right marketing, process, and=
 optimization strategy. Selecting the right channel is critical for any bus=
iness=E2=80=94and products often fail because the company chose the wrong r=
oute to market.=E2=80=9D
5. The Market Curve [ https://substack.com/redirect/f736b53b-df87-427b-b2ef=
-95f33380b29a?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjM=
RMPOw0 ], by Mike Vernal
=E2=80=9CThe market you choose to serve is one of the most important factor=
s for an early-stage startup. And for most technologists, it=E2=80=99s a bl=
ind spot. To help, we wanted to share one way of thinking about market. [=
=E2=80=A6]
The simplest and most important way to think about market size is (a) how m=
any potential customers are there and (b) what might each customer be worth=
 to you. [=E2=80=A6]
Thinking about the number of customers and the revenue per customer is a tr=
emendously clarifying way to think about a single company.=E2=80=9D
6. The Four Fits [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7c7c8aa-98f2-47cb-bbaa-ae=

Ow0 ], by Brian Balfour
=E2=80=9CHow do you grow? The =E2=80=98go-to=E2=80=99 answer for almost eve=
ry question in startups is =E2=80=98build a great product=E2=80=99 or you n=
eed =E2=80=98product market fit.=E2=80=99 Every time I hear that answer, it=
 feels completely [unsatisfying]. Building a great product is a piece of th=
e puzzle, but it=E2=80=99s far from the full picture. There are terrible pr=
oducts that have reached $1B+ and amazing products that never make it anywh=
ere. Why is that?=E2=80=9D
