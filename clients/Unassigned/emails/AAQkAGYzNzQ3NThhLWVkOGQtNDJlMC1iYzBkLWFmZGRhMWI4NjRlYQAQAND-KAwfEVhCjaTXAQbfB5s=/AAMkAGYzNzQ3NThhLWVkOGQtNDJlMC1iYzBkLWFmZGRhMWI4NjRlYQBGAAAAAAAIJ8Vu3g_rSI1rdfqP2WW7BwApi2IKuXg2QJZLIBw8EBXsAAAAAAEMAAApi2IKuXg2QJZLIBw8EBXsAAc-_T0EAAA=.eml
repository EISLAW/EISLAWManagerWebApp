June 3=2C 2025

Comment/Question: Romania faces the dilemma of supporting liberal economic=
/security interests clashing with conservative social/ideological rhetoric=
 (LGBTQ=2C religion=2C etc.) of mainstream Western bodies. The best exampl=
e is with its relationship with the EU.

How do you see this dichotomy playing out in places like Romania=2C Poland=
=2C etc.? Please apply this view to the recent elections in each country a=
s well as to the general concept of a divided West.

Response: The emergence of democratic republics generates the rise of oppo=
sing views. This is the essential virtue of democracies and their strength=
=2E In authoritarian regimes there are divisions as well=2C but they are sup=
pressed in favor of the state=E2=80=99s preferred views. The deep division=
=2C even animosity=2C among citizens over these views is a sign of a healt=
hy democracy. So democracy and discord are natural. There is and should be=
 division over relations with the EU. There are those who regard the EU as=
 the key to entering the European economic and cultural norm. There are ot=
hers who see such engagement as limiting national sovereignty and cultural=
 norms=2C given some EU views on issues like LGBTQ and said norms. This wi=
ll play out in different ways in different countries. The EU offers an ent=
ry into Europe=2C and with it imposes economic and cultural norms. Europe=
 has never been a continent of uniform national cultures=2C so resistance=
 to the EU in spite of any economic benefits makes sense. The
resistance to membership in European norms and the passion for membership=
 is the essence of democratic republics.

I draw a broader lesson here for the United States as well. Division and e=
ven anger is the foundation of democracy. The ability to retain a common s=
ense of national loyalty in the face of democratic division is fundamental=
=2E If lacking=2C it leads to breakdown or tyranny. So Eastern Europe is fac=
ing an existential test. I see this division as natural and healthy=2C so=
 long as the foundation of the nation =E2=80=93 love of one=E2=80=99s own=
=2C including one=E2=80=99s nation=2C regardless of dissent =E2=80=93 is m=
aintained. This is the test all democratic nations must endure and indeed=
 celebrate. So for this level of Eastern European development=2C they are=
 managing as well as can be expected and in many cases better. Are they Eu=
ropeans=2C Romanians or both? Having this debate and surviving this as a n=
ation is the foundation of democratic society.
Comment/Question: There is concern among East Europeans over Western Europ=
e=E2=80=99s ability/willingness to defend the east against Russia. (This w=
ould be particularly true in the scenario of the U.S. backing off NATO and=
 a stronger/uncontested Russia.) From a geopolitical standpoint=2C how val=
id is this concern?


Response: This is indeed the question=2C since nations must look at their=
 own interest first. From my point of view=2C the centrality of this quest=
ion is mitigated by the abominable performance of the Russians in Ukraine.=
 We are over three years into this war and Russia holds less than 20 perce=
nt of Ukraine. This is not the Red Army of the Soviet Union after World Wa=
r II=2C but a shadow of itself. The question is what does it take to block=
 Russian expansionism. The answer at this point is that this is not 1955=
=2C and the amount of support Eastern Europe needs to block Russia is far=
 more moderate=2C well within European capabilities and firmly in Western=
 Europe=E2=80=99s interest.
Question: What is your take on the Ukraine drone attacks deep inside Russi=
an territory?

Response: It was a stunningly brilliant covert operation and reveals the w=
eakness of Russian intelligence and counterintelligence. The KGB where Put=
in began his career would=2C I think=2C have detected this both by penetra=
ting Ukraine intelligence and with intense monitoring of Russia itself. I=
 suspect that the main effect of this will be a significant reconstruction=
 of Russian intelligence =E2=80=93 once superb=2C now stunningly poor. So=
 I place this in the context of my view of the weakness of Russia at this=
 time=2C and also an expectation of a dramatic restructuring of Russian in=
telligence along with Russian military capability. My current view of Russ=
ia is simply the preface to the task of resurrecting Russian capabilities=
 along with possibly a reconsideration of Russia=E2=80=99s role in the wor=
ld.

Comments from May 31^st Q&A

Please compare Russia's actions in Ukraine with U.S. actions during the Cu=
ban missile crisis in terms of motivation=2C precedent and consequences.

Response: The greatest difference is that the U.S. was not engaged in a wa=
r with Russia at the time of the Cuban missile crisis=2C but the Russians=
=E2=80=99 actions in Ukraine are a dimension of an ongoing and bloody war.=
 The essence of the Cuban missile crisis was that both sides badly wanted=
 to avoid a nuclear war=2C and therefore they reached accommodation. Russi=
a withdrew its nuclear weapons=2C and the U.S. abandoned =E2=80=93 or at l=
east radically reduced =E2=80=93 its efforts to destroy the Castro regime.=
 So the Cuban missile crisis actually added a degree of stability to U.S.-=
Russian relations=2C while the Ukrainian action is a chapter in an already=
 ongoing war.

---

How costly has the Ukraine war been to Russia compared to how costly the A=
fghanistan war was to the Soviet Union?

Response: It is impossible for me to calculate the Russian cost in the Ukr=
aine war=2C and extracting the cost of Afghanistan from the defense budget=
 is difficult as well. It is hard to quantify this so I must generalize. T=
he best I can do is produce a nonnumeric and therefore uncertain analysis.
The Ukraine war has cost Russia greatly by diverting resources from the de=
velopment of a consumer economy=2C and by dramatically limiting Western in=
vestment in Russia and Russian access to Western markets. It should be com=
pared to China=E2=80=99s development=2C which was heavily driven by the ab=
ility to export products to the United States and attract American investm=
ent. The U.S. is approximately 25 percent of global GDP. So the qualitativ=
e answer is that Russia=2C by not rapidly winning and putting this war beh=
ind them=2C has suffered a degree of economic isolation from the U.S. and=
 Europe=2C at a time when it urgently needed to participate fully in the W=
estern economic system. Their geopolitical need for a buffer with NATO und=
ermined their geopolitical need for economic power.

Many advanced economies (and others) are experiencing a drop in fertility=
 rates and population decline. As fewer consumers come of age=2C the very=
 engine that powers both private investment and public finance begins to s=
tall. Please comment on how you think this demographic trend will impact c=
onsumer=2C market-driven growth (if at all).

Response: I have written in several books on the demographic crisis: not o=
nly a decline in birth rates but also the extension of life expectancy wit=
hout solutions to the diseases of old age that prevent productivity from t=
he elderly and increase the stress on the available workforce to keep them=
 alive. The fundamental technological transformation in our time will be m=
edical=2C both extending life and human productivity. I see the central ro=
le of AI as to some extent replacing the workforce=2C but far more importa=
ntly=2C producing dramatic medical breakthroughs at the molecular level bo=
th in medications and to some extent in reengineering the internal process=
es of the human body. I am now taking this very personally=2C I should add=
=2E

<strong>Comment/Question:</strong><em> </em><em>Romania faces the dilemma o=
f supporting liberal economic/security interests clashing with conservative=
 social/ideological rhetoric (LGBTQ, religion, etc.) of mainstream Western =
bodies. The best example is with its relationship with the EU.<br>

How do you see this dichotomy playing out in places like Romania, Poland, e=

<strong>Response: </strong>The emergence of democratic republics generates =
the rise of opposing views. This is the essential virtue of democracies and=
 their strength. In authoritarian regimes there are divisions as well, but =
they are suppressed in favor of the state=E2=80=99s preferred views. The de=
ep division, even animosity, among citizens over these views is a sign of a=
 healthy democracy. So democracy and discord are natural. There is and shou=
ld be division over relations with the EU. There are those who regard the E=
U as the key to entering the European economic and cultural norm. There are=
 others who see such engagement as limiting national sovereignty and cultur=
al norms, given some EU views on issues like LGBTQ and said norms. This wil=
l play out in different ways in different countries. The EU offers an entry=
 into Europe, and with it imposes economic and cultural norms. Europe has n=
ever been a continent of uniform national cultures, so resistance to the EU=
 in spite of any economic benefits makes sense. The resistance to membershi=
p in European norms and the passion for membership is the essence of democr=
atic republics.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I draw a broader lesson here for the United States as well. Division and ev=
en anger is the foundation of democracy. The ability to retain a common sen=
se of national loyalty in the face of democratic division is fundamental. I=
f lacking, it leads to breakdown or tyranny. So Eastern Europe is facing an=
 existential test. I see this division as natural and healthy, so long as t=
he foundation of the nation =E2=80=93 love of one=E2=80=99s own, including =
one=E2=80=99s nation, regardless of dissent =E2=80=93 is maintained. This i=
s the test all democratic nations must endure and indeed celebrate. So for =
this level of Eastern European development, they are managing as well as ca=
n be expected and in many cases better. Are they Europeans, Romanians or bo=
th? Having this debate and surviving this as a nation is the foundation of =
democratic society.</p>

                            <strong>Comment/Question: </strong><em>There is=
 concern among East Europeans over Western Europe=E2=80=99s ability/willing=
ness to defend the east against Russia. (This would be particularly true in=
 the scenario of the U.S. backing off NATO and a stronger/uncontested Russi=
a.) From a geopolitical standpoint, how valid is this concern?</em><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>This is indeed the question, since nations must =
look at their own interest first. From my point of view, the centrality of =
this question is mitigated by the abominable performance of the Russians in=
 Ukraine. We are over three years into this war and Russia holds less than =
20 percent of Ukraine. This is not the Red Army of the Soviet Union after W=
orld War II, but a shadow of itself. The question is what does it take to b=
lock Russian expansionism. The answer at this point is that this is not 195=
5, and the amount of support Eastern Europe needs to block Russia is far mo=
re moderate, well within European capabilities and firmly in Western Europe=
=E2=80=99s interest.

                            <strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>What is</em=
><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>your take on the Ukraine drone attacks deep ins=
ide Russian territory?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>It was a stunningly brilliant covert operation a=
nd reveals the weakness of Russian intelligence and counterintelligence. Th=
e KGB where Putin began his career would, I think, have detected this both =
by penetrating Ukraine intelligence and with intense monitoring of Russia i=
tself. I suspect that the main effect of this will be a significant reconst=
ruction of Russian intelligence =E2=80=93 once superb, now stunningly poor.=
 So I place this in the context of my view of the weakness of Russia at thi=
s time, and also an expectation of a dramatic restructuring of Russian inte=
lligence along with Russian military capability. My current view of Russia =
is simply the preface to the task of resurrecting Russian capabilities alon=
g with possibly a reconsideration of Russia=E2=80=99s role in the world.<br=

                            <strong>Comments from May 31<sup>st</sup> Q&amp=
;A</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Please compare Russia's actions in Ukraine with U.S. actions during the=
 Cuban missile crisis in terms of motivation, precedent and consequences.</=
em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>The greatest difference is that the U.S. was not=
 engaged in a war with Russia at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, but =
the Russians=E2=80=99 actions in Ukraine are a dimension of an ongoing and =
bloody war. The essence of the Cuban missile crisis was that both sides bad=
ly wanted to avoid a nuclear war, and therefore they reached accommodation.=
 Russia withdrew its nuclear weapons, and the U.S. abandoned =E2=80=93 or a=
t least radically reduced =E2=80=93 its efforts to destroy the Castro regim=
e. So the Cuban missile crisis actually added a degree of stability to U.S.=
-Russian relations, while the Ukrainian action is a chapter in an already o=
ngoing war.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<em>How costly has the Ukraine war been to Russia compared to how costly th=
e Afghanistan war was to the Soviet Union?</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:&nbsp;</strong>It is impossible for me to calculate the Ru=
ssian cost in the Ukraine war, and extracting the cost of Afghanistan from =
the defense budget is difficult as well. It is hard to quantify this so I m=
ust generalize. The best I can do is produce a nonnumeric and therefore unc=
ertain analysis.

<div><br>
The Ukraine war has cost Russia greatly by diverting resources from the dev=
elopment of a consumer economy, and by dramatically limiting Western invest=
ment in Russia and Russian access to Western markets. It should be compared=
 to China=E2=80=99s development, which was heavily driven by the ability to=
 export products to the United States and attract American investment. The =
U.S. is approximately 25 percent of global GDP. So the qualitative answer i=
s that Russia, by not rapidly winning and putting this war behind them, has=
 suffered a degree of economic isolation from the U.S. and Europe, at a tim=
e when it urgently needed to participate fully in the Western economic syst=
em. Their geopolitical need for a buffer with NATO undermined their geopoli=
tical need for economic power.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<em>Many advanced economies (and others) are experiencing a drop in fertili=
ty rates and population decline. As fewer consumers come of age, the very e=
ngine that powers both private investment and public finance begins to stal=
l. Please comment on how you think this demographic trend will impact consu=
mer, market-driven growth (if at all).</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:</strong>&nbsp;I have written in several books on the demo=
graphic crisis: not only a decline in birth rates but also the extension of=
 life expectancy without solutions to the diseases of old age that prevent =
productivity from the elderly and increase the stress on the available work=
force to keep them alive. The fundamental technological transformation in o=
ur time will be medical, both extending life and human productivity. I see =
the central role of AI as to some extent replacing the workforce, but far m=
ore importantly, producing dramatic medical breakthroughs at the molecular =
level both in medications and to some extent in reengineering the internal =
processes of the human body. I am now taking this very personally, I should=
 add.<br>
