UKRAINE AS VIEWED FROM WARSAW AND WASHINGTON [3]
POLAND AND ITS NEIGHBORS SEE A TEST OF SURVIVAL, WHILE THE U.S. SEES A TEST OF RESTRAINT.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
Last week, I traveled to Washington, D.C., following a visit to Warsaw the week before. Both trips centered on Ukraine and how the war is reshaping global affairs, but they revealed sharply different
perspectives. My stay in Warsaw coincided with the annual Warsaw Security Forum, where discussions carried the immediacy of a continent at risk. In Washington, where I attended the yearly Association
of the United States Army conference and met with policymakers, analysts and business leaders, the mood was more detached – strategic rather than existential.
FRONT-LINE ANXIETY
In Warsaw, I found that Poland’s fears mirror Romania’s. Policymakers, academics and military officers share a conviction that the war in Ukraine is only one phase of a broader conflict Russia
envisions with the West – with Europe as its primary theater. They see NATO’s eastern flank, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, as still insufficiently prepared from a defense
standpoint.
Deterrence, in their view, has worked largely because the U.S. military presence in Poland and Romania has dissuaded Moscow from direct engagement. Yet even as both nations rearm and invest more than
2 percent of their gross domestic product in defense, they know that fighting Russia would mean confronting an adversary that, though weakened, retains hard-earned experience in large-scale land
warfare. Only Ukraine possesses comparable experience today.
As several high-ranking officers and defense experts from Poland, Romania, Turkey, the U.K. and the U.S. told me, NATO’s post-Cold War combat record has little resemblance to what is unfolding in
Ukraine: a full-scale, combined arms invasion supported by every domain of modern warfare.
THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN WARFARE
Conversations in both Warsaw and Washington underscored how the Russia-Ukraine war has transformed conventional warfare, serving as both a testing ground and a catalyst for innovation. Three
developments stand out.
First, information has been democratized. Commercial satellite imagery now gives governments, journalists and even civilians near-real-time visibility into the battlefield. What was once the sole
domain of state intelligence is now accessible to anyone. Ukraine has used this transparency not only for tactical advantage but also to counter Russian disinformation and maintain credibility with
Western partners. Open-source intelligence communities now function as informal extensions of the battlefield, analyzing data that informs public opinion, strategic decisions and even sanctions
policies. This unprecedented fusion of military and civilian insight has made secrecy far harder to preserve.
Second, Ukraine’s innovation in drone warfare has redefined adaptation under pressure. While everyone acknowledges that U.S. and European financial and military support have been critical to
sustaining Ukraine’s resistance, less attention has been given to the country’s creativity in developing new capabilities. Military units frequently identify their own operational needs and
collaborate directly with engineers and small firms to design and deploy tools in weeks instead of years. This decentralized model has given Ukraine a technological edge over Russia, especially in
drone warfare. Drones have become force multipliers, enabling Ukraine to offset its numerical inferiority and strike Russian logistics, command centers and even naval assets in the Black Sea.
Third, the war has reaffirmed the primacy of human will. Ukraine’s national resilience surprised even its allies – and certainly Moscow. Few anticipated that Ukraine would mobilize such a
sustained and cohesive national effort to defend its sovereignty. But that resilience carries a heavy cost, and managing manpower amid exhaustion and loss has become Kyiv’s most pressing challenge.
Russia, by contrast, has worked to insulate its population from the war’s toll. After its partial mobilization triggered mass flight and unrest in fall 2022, the Kremlin shifted toward financial
incentives to attract volunteers – including from abroad. Some foreign recruits seek Russian citizenship or high pay, while others – such as North Korean contingents – represent direct aid from
allied states, implicitly backed by China. This outsourcing shields Moscow from the political fallout of large-scale domestic mobilization and sustains its narrative of endurance under sanctions.
The democratization of intelligence and the rise of drones and other technologies are reshaping how wars are fought, but the outcome still depends on the determination of people – both those on the
front lines and those supporting them from behind. This lesson seems to be resonating in Washington. At the AUSA meeting, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll called on the military to shed its reliance on
decades-old technology and outdated acquisition strategies. Instead, he envisions an agile force that can match or surpass potential adversaries through mastery of drone warfare and an acquisition
system flexible enough to field cutting-edge technologies in months rather than years.
THE POLITICS OF CEASEFIRE
In Warsaw, discussions turned repeatedly to the question of how – or whether – a ceasefire could emerge. Few expect lasting peace, and most fear that any pause in fighting would benefit Moscow,
allowing it to regroup and recalibrate before a new offensive. Yet others argued that Europe itself needs time – to rearm, rebuild its defense industries and strengthen unity – and that Russia
knows it. Therefore, if Russia is indeed intent on testing NATO or directly challenging Europe, it may not wait long.
Two incidents illustrate what many see as Russia’s strategy of probing NATO’s military readiness and political resolve. In one, a Russian naval drone attacked a vessel in the Danube’s internal
waters, evading radar detection. (In previous instances, radar systems picked up aerial drones that had strayed into Romanian territory.) In the second incident, a swarm of drones entered Polish
airspace during Russia’s Zapad military exercises. Though differing tactically, both operations appeared designed to test U.S.-operated radars – the backbone of early warning systems on NATO’s
eastern flank – and gauge Washington’s political response.
Across the region, concern is mounting that Ukraine’s human and material resources are thinning faster than Western resolve can replenish them. The asymmetry is clear: Moscow can escalate
horizontally – through cyber or hybrid means – while NATO remains intent on avoiding a direct confrontation.
In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. experts and policymakers acknowledged the escalation risks inherent in continued military aid. At the same time, financial support has its own downsides. The United
States fears an unstable Russia and a nuclear Russia in equal measure. While Europeans emphasize the danger of Russia testing NATO’s credibility and readiness, their American counterparts stress the
importance of avoiding a direct confrontation with Russia at all costs. The U.S. view is rather simple: European deterrence must carry the first burden. The official line is that the U.S. is fully
committed to defending NATO principles. Unofficially, however, U.S. experts explained that while the United States would support those European allies that had made serious commitments to
strengthening their defense capabilities, they were unsure whether Washington would go to war to defend European interests deemed peripheral to its own.
Washington’s pragmatic stance is being refined as the administration prepares a new national security strategy and reviews its global posture. Despite the noise emanating from think tanks, the media
and Congress, everyone I met agreed that the real decisions are taking place within the White House, among a small circle of senior advisers and national security officials. The central question
remains how to balance America’s enduring commitment to European security with Indo-Pacific priorities and growing domestic fatigue. During my visit, Washington was enduring one of the longest
government shutdowns in recent memory. Discontent is evident across both parties. The protests that took place over the weekend underscore the rising wave of opposition and frustration with the White
House, reinforcing the sense that Washington’s political energy is being consumed by internal discord.
At the same time, the choreography of diplomacy continued. U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a day after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. By
the end of the week, there was renewed talk of potential negotiations between the U.S. and Russia. This sequence of events reflects the tightrope Washington is trying to walk: offering support to Kyiv
while keeping diplomatic channels open with Moscow. The U.S. is determined to manage escalation, preserve flexibility and avoid being drawn into a conflict that could spiral far beyond Europe’s
borders.
Washington, D.C., still radiates power. Since I first visited it two decades ago, there has been a pervasive sense that this is where the decisions that will define the direction of global affairs are
made. The feeling was especially pronounced on this most recent visit, where everything seemed to revolve around what is being decided – or delayed – inside the White House.
In Warsaw, the war in Ukraine felt existential. In Washington, it felt like a variable in a larger equation encompassing the balance of power in Europe, Asia and the United States itself. Yet the two
perspectives are inseparable. The outcome in Ukraine, and perhaps the future of European stability, will hinge not just on Ukrainian resilience or European rearmament, but on whether Washington’s
political will matches its strategic ambition.

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Last week, I traveled to Washington, D.C., following a visit to Warsaw the week before. Both trips centered on Ukraine and how the war is reshaping global affairs, but they revealed sharply different perspectives. My stay in Warsaw coincided with the annual Warsaw Security Forum, where discussions carried the immediacy of a continent at risk. In Washington, where I attended the yearly Association of the United States Army conference and met with policymakers, analysts and business leaders, the mood was more detached – strategic rather than existential.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Front-Line Anxiety</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Warsaw, I found that Poland’s fears mirror Romania’s. Policymakers, academics and military officers share a conviction that the war in Ukraine is only one phase of a broader conflict Russia envisions with the West – with Europe as its primary theater. They see NATO’s eastern flank, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, as still insufficiently prepared from a defense standpoint.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Deterrence, in their view, has worked largely because the U.S. military presence in Poland and Romania has dissuaded Moscow from direct engagement. Yet even as both nations rearm and invest more than 2 percent of their gross domestic product in defense, they know that fighting Russia would mean confronting an adversary that, though weakened, retains hard-earned experience in large-scale land warfare. Only Ukraine possesses comparable experience today.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As several high-ranking officers and defense experts from Poland, Romania, Turkey, the U.K. and the U.S. told me, NATO’s post-Cold War combat record has little resemblance to what is unfolding in Ukraine: a full-scale, combined arms invasion supported by every domain of modern warfare.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The Evolution of Modern Warfare</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Conversations in both Warsaw and Washington underscored how the Russia-Ukraine war has transformed conventional warfare, serving as both a testing ground and a catalyst for innovation. Three developments stand out.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">First, information has been democratized. Commercial satellite imagery now gives governments, journalists and even civilians near-real-time visibility into the battlefield. What was once the sole domain of state intelligence is now accessible to anyone. Ukraine has used this transparency not only for tactical advantage but also to counter Russian disinformation and maintain credibility with Western partners. Open-source intelligence communities now function as informal extensions of the battlefield, analyzing data that informs public opinion, strategic decisions and even sanctions policies. This unprecedented fusion of military and civilian insight has made secrecy far harder to preserve.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Second, Ukraine’s innovation in drone warfare has redefined adaptation under pressure. While everyone acknowledges that U.S. and European financial and military support have been critical to sustaining Ukraine’s resistance, less attention has been given to the country’s creativity in developing new capabilities. Military units frequently identify their own operational needs and collaborate directly with engineers and small firms to design and deploy tools in weeks instead of years. This decentralized model has given Ukraine a technological edge over Russia, especially in drone warfare. Drones have become force multipliers, enabling Ukraine to offset its numerical inferiority and strike Russian logistics, command centers and even naval assets in the Black Sea.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Third, the war has reaffirmed the primacy of human will. Ukraine’s national resilience surprised even its allies – and certainly Moscow. Few anticipated that Ukraine would mobilize such a sustained and cohesive national effort to defend its sovereignty. But that resilience carries a heavy cost, and managing manpower amid exhaustion and loss has become Kyiv’s most pressing challenge.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia, by contrast, has worked to insulate its population from the war’s toll. After its partial mobilization triggered mass flight and unrest in fall 2022, the Kremlin shifted toward financial incentives to attract volunteers – including from abroad. Some foreign recruits seek Russian citizenship or high pay, while others – such as North Korean contingents – represent direct aid from allied states, implicitly backed by China. This outsourcing shields Moscow from the political fallout of large-scale domestic mobilization and sustains its narrative of endurance under sanctions.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The democratization of intelligence and the rise of drones and other technologies are reshaping how wars are fought, but the outcome still depends on the determination of people – both those on the front lines and those supporting them from behind. This lesson seems to be resonating in Washington. At the AUSA meeting, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll called on the military to shed its reliance on decades-old technology and outdated acquisition strategies. Instead, he envisions an agile force that can match or surpass potential adversaries through mastery of drone warfare and an acquisition system flexible enough to field cutting-edge technologies in months rather than years.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The Politics of Ceasefire</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Warsaw, discussions turned repeatedly to the question of how – or whether – a ceasefire could emerge. Few expect lasting peace, and most fear that any pause in fighting would benefit Moscow, allowing it to regroup and recalibrate before a new offensive. Yet others argued that Europe itself needs time – to rearm, rebuild its defense industries and strengthen unity – and that Russia knows it. Therefore, if Russia is indeed intent on testing NATO or directly challenging Europe, it may not wait long.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Two incidents illustrate what many see as Russia’s strategy of probing NATO’s military readiness and political resolve. In one, a Russian naval drone attacked a vessel in the Danube’s internal waters, evading radar detection. (In previous instances, radar systems picked up aerial drones that had strayed into Romanian territory.) In the second incident, a swarm of drones entered Polish airspace during Russia’s Zapad military exercises. Though differing tactically, both operations appeared designed to test U.S.-operated radars – the backbone of early warning systems on NATO’s eastern flank – and gauge Washington’s political response.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Across the region, concern is mounting that Ukraine’s human and material resources are thinning faster than Western resolve can replenish them. The asymmetry is clear: Moscow can escalate horizontally – through cyber or hybrid means – while NATO remains intent on avoiding a direct confrontation.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. experts and policymakers acknowledged the escalation risks inherent in continued military aid. At the same time, financial support has its own downsides. The United States fears an unstable Russia and a nuclear Russia in equal measure. While Europeans emphasize the danger of Russia testing NATO’s credibility and readiness, their American counterparts stress the importance of avoiding a direct confrontation with Russia at all costs. The U.S. view is rather simple: European deterrence must carry the first burden. The official line is that the U.S. is fully committed to defending NATO principles. Unofficially, however, U.S. experts explained that while the United States would support those European allies that had made serious commitments to strengthening their defense capabilities, they were unsure whether Washington would go to war to defend European interests deemed peripheral to its own.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington’s pragmatic stance is being refined as the administration prepares a new national security strategy and reviews its global posture. Despite the noise emanating from think tanks, the media and Congress, everyone I met agreed that the real decisions are taking place within the White House, among a small circle of senior advisers and national security officials. The central question remains how to balance America’s enduring commitment to European security with Indo-Pacific priorities and growing domestic fatigue. During my visit, Washington was enduring one of the longest government shutdowns in recent memory. Discontent is evident across both parties. The protests that took place over the weekend underscore the rising wave of opposition and frustration with the White House, reinforcing the sense that Washington’s political energy is being consumed by internal discord.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">At the same time, the choreography of diplomacy continued. U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a day after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. By the end of the week, there was renewed talk of potential negotiations between the U.S. and Russia. This sequence of events reflects the tightrope Washington is trying to walk: offering support to Kyiv while keeping diplomatic channels open with Moscow. The U.S. is determined to manage escalation, preserve flexibility and avoid being drawn into a conflict that could spiral far beyond Europe’s borders.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington, D.C., still radiates power. Since I first visited it two decades ago, there has been a pervasive sense that this is where the decisions that will define the direction of global affairs are made. The feeling was especially pronounced on this most recent visit, where everything seemed to revolve around what is being decided – or delayed – inside the White House.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Warsaw, the war in Ukraine felt existential. In Washington, it felt like a variable in a larger equation encompassing the balance of power in Europe, Asia and the United States itself. Yet the two perspectives are inseparable. The outcome in Ukraine, and perhaps the future of European stability, will hinge not just on Ukrainian resilience or European rearmament, but on whether Washington’s political will matches its strategic ambition.</p>
