DAILY MEMO: PEACE PROPOSALS IN UKRAINE, AIR DEFENSE IN INDIA [3]
KYIV IS REPORTEDLY WAITING ON MOSCOW TO OUTLINE ITS PLAN FOR A PATH TO CEASEFIRE.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
WAITING ON MOSCOW. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke by phone on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about Moscow’s agenda for its next round of talks with Ukraine,
according to the Russian Foreign Ministry [4]. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed [5] the same day that Kyiv had handed over its ceasefire proposal and was waiting for Moscow to do the
same. On Thursday, Axios reported that Russia’s lead negotiator had proposed holding a second round of peace talks on June 2 in Istanbul. According to the outlet, Kyiv responded with a document
outlining Ukraine’s vision for a ceasefire, future negotiations, confidence-building measures and an in-person meeting between both countries’ presidents – but so far, Russia has yet to deliver
its own plan for a path forward.
INDIA'S AIR DEFENSE. Russia and India are in talks over New Delhi’s request to purchase additional S-400 missile defense systems, Russia’s ambassador to India, Denis Alipov, said [6]. Alipov
further stated that the S-400 was used during Operation Sindoor, in which India struck terrorist-related targets in Pakistan, and that the effectiveness of the system, as well as the BrahMos missiles
(which he said were a product of Russia-India cooperation), was “exemplary.”
RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES. The head of Russia’s Security Council, Sergey Shoigu, said during a meeting with North Korean Minister of Public Security Lee Chang-dae in Moscow [7] that the two countries
are committed to further expanding cooperation. Meanwhile, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency [8], Russia’s deputy interior minister was in Pyongyang this week for talks with the
North’s vice public security minister. North Korean state media also reported [9] that renovation has been completed of the Tumangang railway station near the Russian border – which is the only
rail connection between the two countries.
SYRIAN DEVELOPMENTS. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan held talks with the U.S. special envoy for Syria, Thomas Barrack. According to Saudi media [10], they discussed humanitarian and
economic support for the people of Syria. Meanwhile, Syrian media reported [11] that Saudi budget airline Flynas will begin direct flights between the two countries in the near future.
IRANIAN COMPROMISE? Reuters reported [12] that Iran would consider pausing its uranium enrichment for a year if the U.S. releases frozen Iranian assets abroad and recognizes Tehran’s right to refine
uranium for civilian use. The outlet, which cited official Iranian sources, said the arrangement would also involve Tehran sending part of its highly enriched supplies overseas or converting them into
fuel plates for civilian use. Iran’s Foreign Ministry denied the report [13], saying it would not compromise on its enrichment activities.
U.S.-POLAND RELATIONS. Warsaw is confident that U.S. troops stationed in Poland will remain in the country, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in a new interview [14]. Despite U.S.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in which she called on the Polish people to elect conservative opposition candidate Karol
Nawrocki in the upcoming election, Kosiniak-Kamysz insisted [15] that relations between the two countries remain strong.
DEFENSE DEAL. France and Indonesia signed a defense agreement [16] during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Jakarta on Wednesday. The deal could pave the way for Indonesia to purchase
Rafale fighter jets, Caesar self-propelled howitzers and other military equipment from France.
GETTING TOUGH ON BEIJING. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Wednesday [17] that the U.S. will start “aggressively” revoking visas for Chinese students. The measure will target students
with connections to the Chinese Communist Party and those who are studying in critical fields, Rubio said. He added that Washington would also revise screening criteria for all visa applications from
China and Hong Kong.
PACIFIC TIES. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met on Wednesday [18] with high-level officials from 11 Pacific island countries during a foreign ministers’ summit in China’s Fujian province.
Following the talks, Beijing announced a series of cooperation initiatives related to climate change, disaster prevention and mitigation, maritime trade and other priority areas.
IRANIAN CONNECTIONS. Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, met with delegations from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad [19] to discuss regional developments, including the
situation in Gaza.
FINANCE SECTOR. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met with [20]Morgan Stanley [21]Co-President Daniel Simkowitz in Beijing on Wednesday [22]. During their talks, He said Beijing welcomed more U.S.
financial institutions to participate in the development of China’s capital market.
