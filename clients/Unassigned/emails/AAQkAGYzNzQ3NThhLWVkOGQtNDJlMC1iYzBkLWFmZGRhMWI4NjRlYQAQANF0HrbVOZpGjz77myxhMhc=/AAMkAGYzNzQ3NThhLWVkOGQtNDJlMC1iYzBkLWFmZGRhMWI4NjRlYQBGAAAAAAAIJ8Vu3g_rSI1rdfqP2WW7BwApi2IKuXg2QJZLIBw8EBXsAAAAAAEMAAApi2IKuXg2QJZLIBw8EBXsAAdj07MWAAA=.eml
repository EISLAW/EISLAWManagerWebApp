The anxiety we feel when making financial decisions isn't just a money issu=
e=E2=80=94it's a universal human challenge. The temptation to outsource dif=
ficult choices to AI isn't because we're incapable; it's because decisions =
inherently come with uncertainty, and AI promises to remove that discomfort=
=2E But when we hand over the steering=20=
wheel, we also hand over our opportuni=
ty to grow.
This isn't just about money. The broader frame here is how we use AI prompt=
s, why we phrase questions the way we do, and the hidden psychological need=
s behind those questions. This piece explores a fundamental shift from aski=
ng AI to "tell us what to do" toward leveraging AI to help us understand th=
e options more clearly. The distinction matters in every domain=E2=80=94whe=
ther you're a lawyer researching case law, a marketer planning a campaign, =
or a student crafting an essay.
To illustrate this distinction concretely, I've taken it beyond theory into=
 real-world stakes. I've put actual money=E2=80=94$2,000=E2=80=94on the lin=
e across platforms like Kalshi and Robinhood, testing structured prompts ac=
ross different AI models including Grok 4, Claude Opus, and GPT-o3 Pro.=20
These prompts aren't about seeking advice; they're meticulously crafted to =
produce deep analytical insights. After 90 days, we'll see which AI framewo=
rks provide genuine clarity and actionable analysis when real consequences =
are at stake.
In addition, I=E2=80=99ve put down 7 real prompts to help you think through=
 various solutions with AI as an analzyer=E2=80=94not a decider. Here they =
are:
Cash-Flow Scenario Mapper =E2=80=94 Directs surplus.
Helps you see how different allocation plans (liquidity-first, balanced, gr=
owth-tilt) change your runway and risk.
Portfolio Drift & Rebalance Simulator =E2=80=94 Keeps allocations honest.
Quantifies drift, shows =E2=80=9Cdo nothing=E2=80=9D vs. minimal-trade scen=
arios, and estimates costs so you rebalance only when it=E2=80=99s worth it=
=2E
Offer & Compensation Benchmark Analyzer =E2=80=94 Turns offers into data.
Benchmarks base, bonus, equity, and surfaces high-leverage asks before you =
sign=E2=80=94or negotiate.
Scenario-Based Life-Planning Forecaster =E2=80=94 Maps big forks in the roa=
d.
Compares multi-year net-worth paths (stay vs. move, sabbatical, etc.) with =
QoL scores and sensitivity to shocks.
Debt Payoff Scenario Simulator =E2=80=94 Kills interest strategically.
Runs avalanche, snowball, and liquidity-first tactics, showing debt-free da=
tes and total interest saved without draining reserves.
Retirement Gap & Glide-Path Modeler =E2=80=94 Stress-tests your future payc=
heck.
Monte-Carlo odds of not running out of money, funding gaps in today=E2=80=
=99s dollars, and alternative glide paths to improve success.
Equity & Dilution Scenario Modeler =E2=80=94 Protects founder ownership.
Projects post-round stakes, exit waterfalls, and IRRs so you know exactly w=
hat each fundraising step costs in control and upside.
What can you learn in these pages: very simply, how to use AI as a tool for=
 difficult analyses without using it as a substitute for human decision-mak=
ing.
In the pages ahead, you'll find specific prompts and examples that highligh=
t the difference between passive advice-seeking and active analytical think=
ing. You'll learn how to structure your interactions with AI to enhance you=
r decision-making skills rather than diminish them.=20
Because ultimately, the best way to use AI isn't to eliminate uncertainty=
=E2=80=94it's to become comfortable with it, turning ambiguity into clarity=
, and making smarter, more confident choices in every area of your life.

First, here are the 7 finance prompts [ https://substack.com/redirect/610ef=

The AI Anxiety Trap: Why Smart People Keep Asking ChatGPT to Make Their Mon=
ey Decisions
We're not using AI wrong because we're stupid. We're using it wrong because=
 making financial decisions feels terrifying, and AI promises to take that =
weight off our shoulders. The problem is what we lose when we hand over the=
 wheel.
I watched a friend spend twenty minutes asking ChatGPT whether she should r=
efinance her mortgage. She kept rephrasing the same question, hoping for a =
definitive answer: "Should I refi at 6.2%?" Then "Is now a good time to ref=
inance?" Then "What would you do in my situation?"
ChatGPT gave her perfectly reasonable, completely useless responses about c=
onsidering her financial situation, timeline, and risk tolerance. She final=
ly closed the laptop in frustration and said, "I just want someone to tell =
me what to do."
That sentence crystallized something I'd been noticing everywhere. Smart, c=
apable people aren't using AI badly because they don't understand the techn=
ology. They're using it badly because financial decisions trigger deep anxi=
ety, and AI feels like a way to escape that discomfort.
The problem isn't that AI can't help with money decisions. The problem is t=
hat we're asking it to make decisions instead of helping us think through t=
hem. And in doing so, we're outsourcing exactly the muscle we most need to =
develop.
The anxiety we feel when making financial decisions isn't just a money issu=
e=E2=80=94it's a universal human challenge. The temptation to outsource dif=
ficult choices to AI isn't because we're incapable; it's because decisions =
inherently come with uncertainty, and AI promises to remove that discomfort=
=2E But when we hand over the steering=20=
wheel, we also hand over our opportuni=
ty to grow.
Recent MIT research [ https://substack.com/redirect/e1d64602-bf68-4b8e-88ae=
-b3cb68fd0034?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjM=
RMPOw0 ] reveals why this approach backfires. The study monitored brain act=
ivity in 54 volunteers (aged 18-39, mostly students in Boston) while they c=
ompleted writing tasks using ChatGPT, Google Search, or only their own cogn=
itive resources. Those who leaned on ChatGPT showed the lowest brain engage=
ment, with neural networks showing low activity. Over several months, the C=
hatGPT group developed what researchers called cognitive=E2=80=94becoming i=
ncreasingly dependent on copy-paste tactics while producing work that was i=
ncreasingly substandard.
Now a lot of hay was made out of this, and I am not going into it now. Suff=
ice to say that there are other studies showing productivity improvements a=
nd learning gains for students using ChatGPT. The catch? None of them use m=
indless copy-paste. I include this study here as a vivid reminder of the st=
akes: our brains need us to think for ourselves as much as our finances do.
From Answers to Analysis
The transformation from AI anxiety to AI mastery requires abandoning the se=
arch engine mentality that dominates most AI interactions. Instead of treat=
ing AI as a sophisticated calculator or database, successful finance profes=
sionals (and other high-stakes decisionmakers) approach it as a thinking pa=
rtner capable of multi-layered analysis.
The MIT study illustrates exactly why this shift matters. When participants=
 used ChatGPT as a simple answer machine=E2=80=94copying and pasting respon=
ses without engagement=E2=80=94their brains essentially went offline. But t=

Seven Prompts at a Glance
These prompts [ https://substack.com/redirect/9de5c7d9-9c11-441f-9912-1f511=

 ] represent tested approaches to AI-powered financial analysis that mainta=
in cognitive engagement while leveraging AI capabilities:
1. Cash-Flow Scenario Mapper: Generate at least three surplus-allocation op=
tions with pros and cons, stress-test income-drop scenarios, and highlight =
subjective factors you must weigh yourself.
2. Portfolio Rebalancer & Drift Analyzer: Calculate portfolio drift, benchm=
ark a no-action scenario, propose cost-aware trades, and list subjective fa=
ctors so humans decide next steps.
3. Offer & Compensation Benchmark Coach: Benchmark any job offer against ma=
rket data, surface leverage points, model cash-versus-equity scenarios, the=
n prompt personal judgment for decision-making.
4. Scenario-Based Life-Planning Forecaster: Project multi-scenario net wort=
h over ten years, compare life choices, reveal trade-offs, and prompt subje=
ctive reflection on priorities and values.
5. Debt Payoff Scenario Simulator: Model multiple payoff strategies, compar=
e debt-free dates and interest saved, check emergency-fund safety, and list=
 human factors you must weigh.
6. Retirement Gap & Glide-Path Modeler: Estimate retirement-funding adequac=
y, Monte-Carlo success odds, and alternative glide-paths so users judge tra=
de-offs=E2=80=94not accept one "right" answer.
7. Equity & Dilution Scenario Modeler: Calculate post-round ownership, exit=
-proceeds waterfalls, and dilution impacts across funding paths so founders=
 gauge trade-offs=E2=80=94not accept directives.
The Decision Anxiety Economy
Financial services companies have spent decades exploiting our desire to av=
oid hard choices. "Set it and forget it!" "We'll handle everything!" "Our a=
lgorithm knows best!" The entire robo-advisor industry is built on the prom=
ise that you can automate away the discomfort of making investment decision=
s.
AI is the latest iteration of this same promise, but with a seductive twist=
: it feels like wisdom rather than automation. When Betterment allocates yo=
ur portfolio, you know it's just an algorithm. When ChatGPT explains why yo=
u should max out your 401(k) before paying extra on your mortgage, it sound=
s like thoughtful analysis from a knowledgeable advisor.
But both are fundamentally the same thing: ways to avoid sitting with uncer=
tainty and making choices you'll have to live with.
The deeper issue is that financial decision-making is inherently uncomforta=
ble because it forces us to confront trade-offs we'd rather not think about=
=2E Paying off debt faster means invest=
ing less for retirement. Buying a hous=
e means less flexibility. Picking a job with lower cash comp increases equi=
ty options but reduces budget flexibility now. Every choice forecloses othe=
r possibilities, and our brains hate that.
AI promises to resolve this discomfort by giving us The Answer. But The Ans=
wer doesn't exist. There are only trade-offs, probabilities, and personal p=
references that no algorithm can weigh for you.
What We're Really Asking For
When someone asks ChatGPT "Should I buy this stock?," they're not really as=
king for investment advice. They're asking to be relieved of responsibility=
 for the outcome.
If the stock goes up, they made a smart decision. If it goes down, they can=
 blame the AI. It's a psychological hedge against regret, not a tool for be=
tter decision-making.
This shows up in how people phrase their prompts. They ask "What should I d=
o?" instead of "Help me understand my options." They want recommendations i=
nstead of analysis. They're seeking permission, not insight.
The tragedy is that this approach makes you worse at making decisions over =
time. Every time you outsource a choice to an external authority=E2=80=94wh=
ether it's a financial advisor, a robo-platform, or an AI=E2=80=94you rob y=
ourself of the opportunity to develop judgment.
And financial judgment, like any skill, only improves with practice.
The Analysis Alternative
Here's what changes when you flip from advice-seeking to analysis: instead =
of asking "Should I refinance?", you ask "What are the scenarios where refi=
nancing makes sense, and how do they apply to my situation?"
The AI doesn't make the decision. It helps you map the decision space.
Let me show you the difference with a real example. Last month, I was decid=
ing whether to pay off my car loan early or invest the money instead. The l=
oan rate is 4.8%, and I could reasonable expect 7-8% returns in the market =
over time.
Advice-seeking approach: "ChatGPT, should I pay off my car loan or invest t=
he money?"
Analysis approach: "Here's my exact loan balance, interest rate, monthly pa=
yment, and time remaining. Here's my current investment allocation and risk=
 tolerance. Model the scenarios: guaranteed 4.8% savings from paying off th=
e loan versus probabilistic returns from investing, including what happens =
if the market drops 20% next year."
The first approach gets you generic guidance about debt-to-income ratios an=
d risk tolerance. The second approach gets you specific numbers you can thi=
nk through.
More importantly, the second approach forces you to articulate your actual =
constraints and preferences. Do you value the guaranteed savings or the pot=
ential upside? How would you feel if you chose investing and the market cra=
shed? How much does the psychological weight of debt factor into your decis=
ion?
These questions don't have objectively correct answers. But thinking throug=
h them makes you better at future decisions.
The Structured Thinking Framework
The pattern works across every financial decision: replace "What should I d=
o?" with "Help me understand what happens if..."
Instead of "Should I take this job offer?", ask "Model the 5-year financial=
 impact of this offer versus my current situation, including equity upside =
scenarios, cost of living differences, and career trajectory implications."
Instead of "How should I invest this windfall?", ask "Show me the tax impli=
cations and risk-adjusted returns of putting this money into different buck=
ets: emergency fund, debt payoff, tax-advantaged accounts, and taxable inve=
stments."
Instead of "Should I buy a house?", ask "Compare the total cost of ownershi=
p versus renting over different time horizons, including transaction costs,=
 maintenance, property taxes, and opportunity cost of the down payment."
The AI becomes a scenario generator, not a decision maker. You feed it stru=
ctured inputs and get back structured analysis that helps you think more cl=
early about the trade-offs.
But here's the key: you still have to make the choice. AI can show you the =
math, but it can't tell you how much you value security versus upside, stab=
ility versus flexibility, or guaranteed outcomes versus optimal outcomes.
Why This Is Harder
The analysis approach requires more work upfront. You have to gather your a=
ctual data=E2=80=94account balances, interest rates, tax brackets=E2=80=94i=
nstead of speaking in generalities. You have to think through your constrai=
nts and preferences instead of hoping the AI will figure them out for you.
Most importantly, you have to sit with uncertainty. The analysis might show=
 that both options are reasonable, or that the optimal choice depends on un=
knowable future events. That's uncomfortable, but it's also reality.
The advice-seeking approach feels easier because it promises certainty. But=
 that certainty is illusory. You're not avoiding the risk of making the wro=
ng choice; you're just obscuring who's making the choice and on what basis.
The analysis approach acknowledges uncertainty upfront and helps you make d=
ecisions despite it. That's a learnable skill, and it compounds over time.
The Broader Pattern
This dynamic extends far beyond personal finance. We're seeing the same pat=
tern everywhere AI touches decision-making: people using sophisticated tool=
s to avoid thinking rather than to think better.
Lawyers asking AI to write briefs instead of using it to research case law =
more efficiently. Marketers asking AI to create entire campaigns instead of=
 using it to generate ideas they can refine. Students asking AI to write es=
says instead of using it to help organize their thoughts.
In every case, the tool could enhance human judgment, but we're using it to=
 replace human judgment instead.
The financial domain is just particularly revealing because money decisions=
 matter so much and because the costs of outsourcing them compound over dec=
ades.
What We Actually Need
The goal isn't to avoid AI for financial decisions. The goal is to use AI i=
n ways that make you better at making decisions rather than worse.
That means treating AI as a research assistant, not an advisor. A scenario =
generator, not an oracle. A way to run calculations faster, not a way to av=
oid calculations altogether.
I'm putting this principle to the test right now with real money. I've allo=
cated $2,000 across Kalshi and Robinhood to test how well different LLMs pe=
rform analytical tasks when there are actual consequences. Grok 4 gets $400=

=80=94not recommendations=E2=80=94on specific trades and predictions.
The goal isn't to find the best stock picker. It's to see how well-designed=
 prompts perform when I have skin in the game. After 90 days, I'll know whi=
ch models do the most thorough research, spot the most relevant variables, =
and deliver the most useful analysis (and no I won=E2=80=99t just judge it =
by financial performance).
But here's the key: I'm still making every decision. The AI provides analys=
is, I choose how much to risk and I actually make the trades. In this case =
I make the thoughtful choice to allow AI to actually execute on its analysi=
s because my larger goal is to understand how different models perform.
The larger picture? Starting to get comfortable with the fact that most fin=
ancial decisions don't have objectively correct answers. Multiple perspecti=
ves from multiple LLMs is actually useful here. They may have answers that =
fit your specific situation, timeline, and preferences=E2=80=94but you have=
 to do the work to figure out what those are.
Most importantly, it means recognizing that the discomfort of making choice=
s is a feature, not a bug. That discomfort is what forces you to clarify yo=
ur values, understand the trade-offs, and develop the judgment you'll need =
for the next decision.
The people who learn to work with AI this way=E2=80=94as a thinking partner=
 rather than a decision substitute=E2=80=94will make dramatically better ch=
oices over time. The people who use AI to avoid thinking will find themselv=
es more dependent, more anxious, and no better at handling uncertainty than=
 when they started.
The choice, ironically, is entirely yours.
How to Run These Prompts
Working with these structured prompts requires a simple three-step process =
that maintains cognitive engagement while leveraging AI capabilities:
Gather Real Numbers: Before engaging with AI, collect your actual financial=
 data=E2=80=94account balances, interest rates, income figures, and specifi=
c timelines. Vague inputs generate vague outputs, while precise data enable=
s meaningful analysis.
Run Prompt: Use the structured prompts as frameworks, not scripts. Adapt th=
em to your specific situation while maintaining the core elements: clear in=
puts, requested analytical approaches, and structured output formats that f=
acilitate comparison and decision-making.
Compare Scenarios: Review the AI-generated scenarios and analysis, but resi=
st the urge to simply accept the first option that seems reasonable. Your j=
ob is to weigh the trade-offs, consider factors the AI cannot quantify (you=
r personal preferences, family dynamics, career aspirations), and make the =
final decision based on your complete understanding of the situation.
The key insight from the MIT research is that this process keeps your brain=
 actively engaged rather than passively consuming AI output. You're using A=
I to enhance your thinking, not replace it.
What's your experience with using AI for decisions versus analysis? Are you=
 finding ways to enhance your thinking, or falling into the advice-seeking =
trap?

finance her mortgage. She kept rephrasing the same question, hoping for a d=

uot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26=

feels like a way to escape that discomfort.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=

 opportunity to grow.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=

 desire to avoid hard choices. &quot;Set it and forget it!&quot; &quot;We'l=
l handle everything!&quot; &quot;Our algorithm knows best!&quot; The entire=
 robo-advisor industry is built on the promise that you can automate away t=
he discomfort of making investment decisions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=
px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">AI is the lat=
est iteration of this same promise, but with a seductive twist: it feels li=
ke wisdom rather than automation. When Betterment allocates your portfolio,=
 you know it's just an algorithm. When ChatGPT explains why you should max =
out your 401(k) before paying extra on your mortgage, it sounds like though=
tful analysis from a knowledgeable advisor.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px=

yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">The deeper issue is that financial decision-making is inherently un=
comfortable because it forces us to confront trade-offs we'd rather not thi=
nk about. Paying off debt faster means investing less for retirement. Buyin=

ses equity options but reduces budget flexibility now. Every choice foreclo=
ses other possibilities, and our brains hate that.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=

 the potential upside? How would you feel if you chose investing and the ma=

 You have to gather your actual data=E2=80=94account balances, interest rat=
