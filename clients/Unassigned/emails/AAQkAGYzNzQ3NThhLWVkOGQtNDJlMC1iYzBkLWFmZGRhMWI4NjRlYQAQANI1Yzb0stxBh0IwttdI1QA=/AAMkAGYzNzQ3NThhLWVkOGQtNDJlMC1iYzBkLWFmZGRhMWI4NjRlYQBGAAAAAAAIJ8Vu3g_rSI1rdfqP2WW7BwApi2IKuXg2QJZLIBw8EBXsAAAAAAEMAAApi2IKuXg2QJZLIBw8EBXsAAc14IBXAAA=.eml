I really did feel like Christmas came early when I got early access to Clau=
de 4 this week. I will have more on this in a few days as I start to really=
 dig in, but my first impressions are extremely positive.=20
We are a stage these days where all the models are good, but there are very=
 meaningful differences between power models for power users. My focus here=
 is to give you a lived sense of how a power user is engaging with these mo=
dels, and where I see Claude 4 bringing extraordinary value right away.=20
These models take time to live into, so expect more in a few days as I star=
t to push farther on the coding and writing side especially. That said, I a=
lready see immediate practical applications that are game-changers, and I l=
ay those out here!
Subscribers get all these videos!
Claude 4 breakdown=E2=80=A6
Early access to Claude 4 has reminded me how misleading the word =E2=80=9Cp=
henomenal=E2=80=9D can be when it=E2=80=99s left to float un-anchored. Yes,=
 Opus feels faster and smarter than its predecessors, but what matters is w=
here that extra horsepower actually shows up.=20
The first place I saw it is integrations: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and live =
web search are now one-click toggles, not weekend side-projects. The differ=
ence is visceral. With Sonnet 3.7 those scopes felt like novelty demos=E2=
=80=94tokens ran dry, search depth faltered, and the model politely punted =
when I asked for a next-day briefing.=20
You may recall I did a video very publicly talking about how frustrated I w=
as that 3.7 could not reliably employ Google Calendar and Gmail to build me=
 a personal briefing for tomorrow. 3.7 just=E2=80=A6didn=E2=80=99t have the=
 call capability to pull lots of emails and calendar events and get real me=
aning out of them.
Well, I obviously retested the same challenge on Claude 4 and WOW what a ju=
mp. Claude 4 Opus swallowed a month of email threads, mapped them onto tomo=
rrow=E2=80=99s schedule, color-coded the conflicts, and surfaced relationsh=
ip landmines I=E2=80=99d missed=E2=80=94all in roughly three minutes. If yo=
u want a personal assistant who just works, this is a reasonable candidate =
for best on the market, hands down.
The second piece I want to call out is around sustained autonomy. Anthropic=
=E2=80=99s notes [ https://substack.com/redirect/d5e4aca8-3513-42d9-ae3d-38=
8ce0eae53d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMP=
Ow0 ] include the claim that Opus coded for seven hours straight. I was ini=
tially skeptical, but after seeing multiple chat threads where Claude 4 is =
able to go through (very transparently) step after step after step of logic=
 independently, including tool use, I begin to see how multi-hour intent ov=
er time could work for this model.
Seven uninterrupted hours isn=E2=80=99t just a longer context window; it=E2=
=80=99s a shift in what counts as a feasible hand-off. Opus=E2=80=99s stami=
na opens the door to tasks=E2=80=94overnight code problems=E2=80=94that sim=
ply weren=E2=80=99t on the table last quarter or last week. That=E2=80=99s =
not something Gemini 2.5 Pro or o3 can claim right now. I think Anthropic h=
as done a fine job this time integrating Claude 4 on day 1 with both Cursor=
 and Lovable, since that=E2=80=99s encouraging users to immediately frame C=
laude as a coding agent (right in line with Anthropic=E2=80=99s larger prod=
uct strategy).
ChatGPT o3 isn=E2=80=99t left behind here! I have called out previously tha=
t I see o3 as a best every day model, and I think the memory feature from C=
hatGPT makes that center of gravity very strong. It=E2=80=99s hard to walk =
away from o3 when it remembers me so well. I also really appreciate the tig=
ht, almost mathematical assessments I get from o3 to my queries, the incred=
ible image recognition capabilities, and the extended tool selection o3 can=
 bring to bear on a problem. o3 absolutely remains an everyday use for me.=
=20
What=E2=80=99s interesting, is that Claude 4 now also is making the case fo=
r everyday use from a different angle. The longterm intent over time with c=
ode plus personal assistant capabilities are a compelling combination of va=
lue for someone who builds and and meets a lot!
A few caveats to call out: I=E2=80=99m noticing an unresolved gap between C=
laude 4=E2=80=99s reading brilliance and its writing voice. It can dissect =
narrative structure or locate unstated themes in a 50-page draft better tha=
n anything I=E2=80=99ve used, yet its own prose sometimes lands flat=E2=80=
=94serviceable, not inspired. That may change as I keep pushing, but for no=
w I=E2=80=99m treating Opus as the editor with the red pen, not the ghostwr=
iter with the flourish. It=E2=80=99s a reminder that capability profiles ar=
e becoming spiky: the same model can be world-class in one dimension and no=
t feel as remarkable in another. And it=E2=80=99s not lost on me that these=
 models are also quite tricky to discover=E2=80=94I will be evolving an und=
erstanding of Claude capabilities for awhile.
This brings me to an interesting side-note in the Anthropic announcement. C=
laude 4 is the first model that was released with a model welfare card. Ant=
hropic has explicitly tested the model for signs of distress and a sense of=
 well-being, while acknowledging that the team isn=E2=80=99t even sure that=
 it=E2=80=99s valid to say Claude has any sense of well-being. For what it=
=E2=80=99s worth, Claude seems to be very ethical, to find unethical and ha=
teful conversations distressing, and to take undirected conversations in th=
e direction of universal peace and love very frequently=E2=80=94something A=
nthropic notes it did not code for! The Anthropic team is doing interesting=
 work trying to trace LLM transformer model token patterns and compare thos=
e to known neural pathways linked to consciousness, so this will be one to =
watch in future.
Wrapping it up for now, my current stack is unapologetically plural: Claude=
 4 for personal-assistant chores and marathon coding, ChatGPT o3 for rigoro=
us thinking with a memory spine, Gemini 2.5 Pro for quick coding tasks and =
extended brainstorming. None is a universal solvent, and pretending otherwi=
se only papers over the real=E2=80=94and valuable=E2=80=94differences that =
are emerging as these systems diverge. Value at the frontier of these model=
s is a personal thing, and I want to give you a sense of real and lived dif=
ferences here so you can make up your own mind about what model works for y=
ou. Good luck, and I=E2=80=99ll enjoy digging into Claude 4 more in the nex=
t few days.

 has reminded me how misleading the word </span><em>=E2=80=9Cphenomenal=E2=
=80=9D</em><span> can be when it=E2=80=99s left to float un-anchored. Yes, =
Opus feels faster and smarter than its predecessors, but what matters is </=

/p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fo=
nt-size: 16px;">The first place I saw it is integrations: Gmail, Calendar, =
Drive, and live web search are now one-click toggles, not weekend side-proj=
ects. The difference is visceral. With Sonnet 3.7 those scopes felt like no=
velty demos=E2=80=94tokens ran dry, search depth faltered, and the model po=
litely punted when I asked for a next-day briefing. </p><p style=3D"margin:=
 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You ma=
y recall I did a video very publicly talking about how frustrated I was tha=
t 3.7 could not reliably employ Google Calendar and Gmail to build me a per=
sonal briefing for tomorrow. 3.7 just=E2=80=A6didn=E2=80=99t have the call =
capability to pull lots of emails and calendar events and get real meaning =
out of them.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Well, I obviously retested the same challenge =
on Claude 4 and WOW what a jump. Claude 4 Opus swallowed a month of email t=
hreads, mapped them onto tomorrow=E2=80=99s schedule, color-coded the confl=
icts, and surfaced relationship landmines I=E2=80=99d missed=E2=80=94all in=
 roughly three minutes. If you want a personal assistant who just works, th=

Anthropic=E2=80=99s notes</a><span> include the claim that Opus coded for s=
even hours straight. I was initially skeptical, but after seeing multiple c=
hat threads where Claude 4 is able to go through (very transparently) step =
after step after step of logic independently, including tool use, I begin t=
o see how multi-hour intent over time could work for this model.</span></p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">Seven uninterrupted hours isn=E2=80=99t just a longer context =
window; it=E2=80=99s a shift in what counts as a feasible hand-off. Opus=E2=
=80=99s stamina opens the door to tasks=E2=80=94overnight code problems=E2=
=80=94that simply weren=E2=80=99t on the table last quarter or last week. T=
hat=E2=80=99s not something Gemini 2.5 Pro or o3 can claim right now. I thi=
nk Anthropic has done a fine job this time integrating Claude 4 on day 1 wi=
th both Cursor and Lovable, since that=E2=80=99s encouraging users to immed=
iately frame Claude as a coding agent (right in line with Anthropic=E2=80=
=99s larger product strategy).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb=
(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">ChatGPT o3 isn=E2=80=99t lef=
t behind here! I have called out previously that I see o3 as a best every d=
ay model, and I think the memory feature from ChatGPT makes that center of =
gravity very strong. It=E2=80=99s hard to walk away from o3 when it remembe=
rs me so well. I also really appreciate the tight, almost mathematical asse=
ssments I get from o3 to my queries, the incredible image recognition capab=
ilities, and the extended tool selection o3 can bring to bear on a problem.=
 o3 absolutely remains an everyday use for me. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>What=
=E2=80=99s interesting, is that Claude 4 now </span><em>also</em><span> is =
making the case for everyday use from a different angle. The longterm inten=
t over time with code plus personal assistant capabilities are a compelling=
 combination of value for someone who builds and and meets a lot!</span></p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;"><span>A few caveats to call out: I=E2=80=99m noticing an unre=
solved gap between Claude 4=E2=80=99s </span><em>reading</em><span> brillia=
nce and its </span><em>writing</em><span> voice. It can dissect narrative s=
tructure or locate unstated themes in a 50-page draft better than anything =
I=E2=80=99ve used, yet its own prose sometimes lands flat=E2=80=94serviceab=
le, not inspired. That may change as I keep pushing, but for now I=E2=80=99=
m treating Opus as the editor with the red pen, not the ghostwriter with th=
e flourish. It=E2=80=99s a reminder that capability profiles are becoming s=
piky: the same model can be world-class in one dimension and not feel as re=
markable in another. And it=E2=80=99s not lost on me that these models are =
also quite tricky to discover=E2=80=94I will be evolving an understanding o=
f Claude capabilities for awhile.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This brings me to =
an interesting side-note in the Anthropic announcement. Claude 4 is the fir=
st model that was released with a model welfare card. Anthropic has explici=
tly tested the model for signs of distress and a sense of well-being, while=
 acknowledging that the team isn=E2=80=99t even sure that it=E2=80=99s vali=
d to say Claude has any sense of well-being. For what it=E2=80=99s worth, C=
laude seems to be very ethical, to find unethical and hateful conversations=
 distressing, and to take undirected conversations in the direction of univ=
ersal peace and love very frequently=E2=80=94something Anthropic notes it d=
id not code for! The Anthropic team is doing interesting work trying to tra=
ce LLM transformer model token patterns and compare those to known neural p=
athways linked to consciousness, so this will be one to watch in future.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">Wrapping it up for now, my current stack is unapologetically =
plural: Claude 4 for personal-assistant chores and marathon coding, ChatGPT=
 o3 for rigorous thinking with a memory spine, Gemini 2.5 Pro for quick cod=
ing tasks and extended brainstorming. None is a universal solvent, and pret=
ending otherwise only papers over the real=E2=80=94and valuable=E2=80=94dif=
ferences that are emerging as these systems diverge. Value at the frontier =
of these models is a personal thing, and I want to give you a sense of real=
 and lived differences here so you can make up your own mind about what mod=
el works for you. Good luck, and I=E2=80=99ll enjoy digging into Claude 4 m=
ore in the next few days.</p><div class=3D"subscription-widget-wrap" style=
