GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: TRUMP'S GAZA PEACE PLAN, LEADERS IN HISTORY [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
_Question: Can Trump’s proposal on Gaza actually bring peace, or will it simply fail as all peace plans in the Middle East seem to fail?_
Response: The Israeli geopolitical imperative is to end the threat that organizations pose to Israel. The fact that Israel is a very small country, about 80 miles deep at its widest, means that any
military defeat of Israel would end in its destruction. Both threats like Hamas, or the possibility of a neighboring country becoming a substantial military power, threaten Israel’s security at the
very least or even its survival. Israel’s only solution to this problem is to increase its strategic depth by creating deep buffers under Israeli military control that would make an attack on Israel
by terrorists extremely improbable, and also create a buffer if an Arab nation attempts to wage conventional war against Israel.
The Palestinian geopolitical imperative is to recover the Palestinian homeland or at the very least create a Palestinian homeland on what is left of Palestine after the U.N. decision to partition
Palestine into a Jewish state and a Palestinian state, in particular on the West Bank.
For Israel, a Palestinian state on the West Bank would be a constant threat of actions like Hamas’ along the long border between the two countries. For the Palestinians, they were ejected from their
homeland by the Jews and a U.N. resolution, and from a nation on the West Bank that was denied them by Jordan, which took control of the West Bank in 1948. The Palestinians are a nation urgently
searching for a homeland. Israel is small nation fearing attack and potential destruction by any evolving Arab power on its current border.
For Israel, its area of control must be Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. For the Palestinians, their dream is recovering all of Palestine. The Israelis fear that a
Palestinian state on the West Bank would be a mortal threat to Israel, given the fact that the Palestinians could evolve from deep military weakness to a major power, as Israel did. The fear and
hatred on both sides is rational, with any solution having to be based on mutual trust that does not and cannot exist. The principle of Trump’s settlement is that the areas around Israel be under
the control of neutral foreign powers, becoming the homeland for the Palestinians. From the Israeli point of view, depending on the willingness and ability of foreign forces to guarantee that
Palestine will not become a threat to Israel is betting Israel’s existence on the willingness of the foreign powers to remain there indefinitely and prevent the Palestinians from launching
Hamas-style attacks.
Both nations have fundamental needs and pose fundamental threats to each other. The willingness of any third party to commit to a permanent presence to maintain the peace between two countries that
live in fear of each other is difficult for both to accept. At the same time, there is no other solution conceivable in this situation. Each needs guarantees that no one can give. So they may both
make gestures toward peace, but the tragedy is that eventual betrayal is likely and the existence of both is threatened. There can be a settlement but I doubt it will last. There was no short answer
to that question.
-------------------------
_Question: I was taught in school in the Soviet Union that the role of the leader in history is nil. It was a tenet of the communist ideology first proposed by Lenin. History shapes leaders, not the
other way. But I am not convinced. I believe leaders make their own choices and have a heavy bearing on how history shapes out._
_Take Hitler. You may say that Germany was an unhappy country at the time and it demanded a leader like that. But during that time many countries were unhappy countries. It took a megalomaniac like
Hitler to lead one to slaughtering millions of people. No Hitler emerged in other countries; they did not do the slaughter. How do you respond to that?_
Response: The Germans were more than unhappy. They felt betrayed. While Germany in World War I declared war on France and Russia, they felt they did so as a defensive measure to prevent them from
attacking Germany simultaneously. Britain, not under threat, declared war on them. In the Germans’ minds, the war was not initiated by them but by their enemies. After their surrender, instead of an
honorable peace, they were presented with the Treaty of Versailles, whose terms of surrender made demands that rendered Germany an economic disaster that could not recover. The following Weimar regime
did not rebel against the treaty but allowed Germany to remain impoverished and crippled. From the German point of view, they had fought an honorable war and were forced into a dishonorable and
ruinous peace – as if the allies had no role in initiating the war – and led by a government that was a tool of the allies.
True or not, this was the German view. Hitler had served in the trenches, not as an officer but as a soldier. He, unlike Weimar, was a bitter spokesman for a bitter nation. He promised to void
Versailles and to return Germany to prosperity and respect. Hitler not only was responding to the reality of the German people, but he was one of them, born poor, suffering in the trenches, and
betrayed by the elite that agreed to surrender on the terms of Versailles. Like all leaders, Hitler felt or at least understood the pain of the German public, was part of the public, and promised to
revive Germany and seek revenge on its enemies, including the Jews, whom he held responsible for the defeat and peace. Given the agony the allies had imposed on Germany, Hitler represented the
solution. For the Germans, he was a voice of reason. Hitler claimed to be Germany, and he made a case which was both persuasive and, to an extent, true. The elite had led the German people into their
situation. Only a man like Hitler, one of them, could become leader. Hitler was created by reality; he did not make the reality.
Weimar was a regime of reasonable men who had let Germany take full responsibility for the war, and allowed it to be punished. Hitler did not lead Germany, Germany led Hitler. So when we speak of
Hitler, I see him as an invention of Germany after World War I. I also think that the Treaty of Versailles had to be forced on Germany given the bitterness of the French and British publics. So Hitler
is the perfect argument for my view that leaders do not lead. Rather, leaders follow the reality in which a nation finds itself. He ruled because he understood what the nation demanded, and what it
demanded was a man like Hitler. I should add that I say this as a Jew whose father and mother survived his concentration camps. To understand history, you must force yourself not to have emotions
while you think of history. Emotions are unreliable guides to reality.
-------------------------
_Question: India poses no significant military threat to China but it is a rising power threat to China. The Indian military is skilled at digging into hills and cannot be easily dislodged from its
defensive positions. Therefore, what alternative ways can China find to handle India?_
Response: In the border battles India and China have fought in the last few years, the Indians have done quite well. But the real fear of China is not an Indian attack, but rather a U.S.-Indian
alliance that would place U.S. forces on the Chinese border. It is important not to overestimate or underestimate your enemy. In the case of China, they have little combat experience, and that
experience is vital to the high command, which has not been tested in a major war. I am deeply impressed by the Chinese ability to appear powerful, but less by their experience of war. I do not think
that there is a likely war between China and India. Neither has the interest or the confidence in its military to start a major war. The years of neither attacking the other significantly is the basis
of that claim. But the Chinese are very worried if there were ever a major American deployment in India, which is also unlikely.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The Isra=
eli geopolitical imperative is to end the threat that organizations pose to=
 Israel. The fact that Israel is a very small country, about 80 miles deep =
at its widest, means that any military defeat of Israel would end in its de=
struction. Both threats like Hamas, or the possibility of a neighboring cou=
ntry becoming a substantial military power, threaten Israel=E2=80=99s secur=
ity at the very least or even its survival. Israel=E2=80=99s only solution =
to this problem is to increase its strategic depth by creating deep buffers=
 under Israeli military control that would make an attack on Israel by terr=
orists extremely improbable, and also create a buffer if an Arab nation att=
empts to wage conventional war against Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Palestinian ge=
opolitical imperative is to recover the Palestinian homeland or at the very=
 least create a Palestinian homeland on what is left of Palestine after the=
 U.N. decision to partition Palestine into a Jewish state and a Palestinian=
 state, in particular on the West Bank.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For Israel, a Pale=
stinian state on the West Bank would be a constant threat of actions like H=
amas=E2=80=99 along the long border between the two countries. For the Pale=
stinians, they were ejected from their homeland by the Jews and a U.N. reso=
lution, and from a nation on the West Bank that was denied them by Jordan, =
which took control of the West Bank in 1948. The Palestinians are a nation =
urgently searching for a homeland. Israel is small nation fearing attack an=
d potential destruction by any evolving Arab power on its current border.</=
p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For Israel, its ar=
ea of control must be Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and southern L=
ebanon. For the Palestinians, their dream is recovering all of Palestine. T=
he Israelis fear that a Palestinian state on the West Bank would be a morta=
l threat to Israel, given the fact that the Palestinians could evolve from =
deep military weakness to a major power, as Israel did. The fear and hatred=
 on both sides is rational, with any solution having to be based on mutual =
trust that does not and cannot exist. The principle of Trump=E2=80=99s sett=
lement is that the areas around Israel be under the control of neutral fore=
ign powers, becoming the homeland for the Palestinians. From the Israeli po=
int of view, depending on the willingness and ability of foreign forces to =
guarantee that Palestine will not become a threat to Israel is betting Isra=
el=E2=80=99s existence on the willingness of the foreign powers to remain t=
here indefinitely and prevent the Palestinians from launching Hamas-style a=
ttacks.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Both nations have =
fundamental needs and pose fundamental threats to each other. The willingne=
ss of any third party to commit to a permanent presence to maintain the pea=
ce between two countries that live in fear of each other is difficult for b=
oth to accept. At the same time, there is no other solution conceivable in =
this situation. Each needs guarantees that no one can give. So they may bot=
h make gestures toward peace, but the tragedy is that eventual betrayal is =
likely and the existence of both is threatened. There can be a settlement b=
ut I doubt it will last. There was no short answer to that question.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: I wa=
s taught in school in the Soviet Union that the role of the leader in histo=
ry is nil. It was a tenet of the communist ideology first proposed by Lenin=
. History shapes leaders, not the other way. But I am not convinced. I beli=
eve leaders make their own choices and have a heavy bearing on how history =
shapes out.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Take Hitler. Y=
ou may say that Germany was an unhappy country at the time and it demanded =
a leader like that. But during that time many countries were unhappy countr=
ies. It took a megalomaniac like Hitler to lead one to slaughtering million=
s of people. No Hitler emerged in other countries; they did not do the slau=
ghter. How do you respond to that?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The Germ=
ans were more than unhappy. They felt betrayed. While Germany in World War =
I declared war on France and Russia, they felt they did so as a defensive m=
easure to prevent them from attacking Germany simultaneously. Britain, not =
under threat, declared war on them. In the Germans=E2=80=99 minds, the war =
was not initiated by them but by their enemies. After their surrender, inst=
ead of an honorable peace, they were presented with the Treaty of Versaille=
s, whose terms of surrender made demands that rendered Germany an economic =
disaster that could not recover. The following Weimar regime did not rebel =
against the treaty but allowed Germany to remain impoverished and crippled.=
 From the German point of view, they had fought an honorable war and were f=
orced into a dishonorable and ruinous peace =E2=80=93 as if the allies had =
no role in initiating the war =E2=80=93 and led by a government that was a =
tool of the allies.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">True or not, this =
was the German view. Hitler had served in the trenches, not as an officer b=
ut as a soldier. He, unlike Weimar, was a bitter spokesman for a bitter nat=
ion. He promised to void Versailles and to return Germany to prosperity and=
 respect. Hitler not only was responding to the reality of the German peopl=
e, but he was one of them, born poor, suffering in the trenches, and betray=
ed by the elite that agreed to surrender on the terms of Versailles. Like a=
ll leaders, Hitler felt or at least understood the pain of the German publi=
c, was part of the public, and promised to revive Germany and seek revenge =
on its enemies, including the Jews, whom he held responsible for the defeat=
 and peace. Given the agony the allies had imposed on Germany, Hitler repre=
sented the solution. For the Germans, he was a voice of reason. Hitler clai=
med to be Germany, and he made a case which was both persuasive and, to an =
extent, true. The elite had led the German people into their situation. Onl=
y a man like Hitler, one of them, could become leader. Hitler was created b=
y reality; he did not make the reality.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Weimar was a regim=
e of reasonable men who had let Germany take full responsibility for the wa=
r, and allowed it to be punished. Hitler did not lead Germany, Germany led =
Hitler. So when we speak of Hitler, I see him as an invention of Germany af=
ter World War I. I also think that the Treaty of Versailles had to be force=
d on Germany given the bitterness of the French and British publics. So Hit=
ler is the perfect argument for my view that leaders do not lead. Rather, l=
eaders follow the reality in which a nation finds itself. He ruled because =
he understood what the nation demanded, and what it demanded was a man like=
 Hitler. I should add that I say this as a Jew whose father and mother surv=
ived his concentration camps. To understand history, you must force yoursel=
f not to have emotions while you think of history. Emotions are unreliable =
guides to reality.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Indi=
a poses no significant military threat to China but it is a rising power th=
reat to China. The Indian military is skilled at digging into hills and can=
not be easily dislodged from its defensive positions. Therefore, what alter=
native ways can China find to handle India?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: In the b=
order battles India and China have fought in the last few years, the Indian=
s have done quite well. But the real fear of China is not an Indian attack,=
 but rather a U.S.-Indian alliance that would place U.S. forces on the Chin=
ese border. It is important not to overestimate or underestimate your enemy=
. In the case of China, they have little combat experience, and that experi=
ence is vital to the high command, which has not been tested in a major war=
. I am deeply impressed by the Chinese ability to appear powerful, but less=
 by their experience of war. I do not think that there is a likely war betw=
een China and India. Neither has the interest or the confidence in its mili=
tary to start a major war. The years of neither attacking the other signifi=
cantly is the basis of that claim. But the Chinese are very worried if ther=
e were ever a major American deployment in India, which is also unlikely.</=
