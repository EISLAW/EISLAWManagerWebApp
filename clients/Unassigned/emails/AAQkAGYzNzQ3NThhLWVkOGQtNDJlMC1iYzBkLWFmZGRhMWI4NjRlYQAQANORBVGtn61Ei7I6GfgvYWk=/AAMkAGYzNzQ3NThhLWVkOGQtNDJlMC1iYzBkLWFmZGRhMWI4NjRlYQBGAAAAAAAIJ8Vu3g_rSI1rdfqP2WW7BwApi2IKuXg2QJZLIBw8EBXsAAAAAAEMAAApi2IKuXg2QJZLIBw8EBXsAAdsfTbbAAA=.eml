INDONESIA’S STRATEGY IN THE TARIFF WAR [3]
LIKE MANY COUNTRIES, IT MUST BALANCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.
BY: VICTORIA HERCZEGH
After U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would impose tariffs on much of the world, Indonesia was among the first countries to strike a reciprocal agreement. According to the
agreement, Indonesia would face a 19 percent tariff rate instead of the original 32 percent starting Aug. 7. In return, it pledged to purchase 50 Boeing aircraft, mainly from the 777 series, and the
government in Jakarta would import $15 billion of U.S. energy commodities and $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products.
Despite public praise of the deal from Indonesia’s president, reports indicate that Jakarta is still in talks with Washington to secure lower rates for certain products. The fact that Indonesia has
chosen to continue negotiating signals its dissatisfaction with the deal already in place. Good political ties with the U.S will help Indonesia maintain a position in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, but it still needs to stabilize its economy and minimize its vulnerability to the changes in export markets. This means Jakarta will want to reach a favorable trade deal, elements of
which it can use for its own advantage while avoiding overdependence on a bigger power.
Not that Indonesia is in any danger of economic collapse anytime soon. Over the past few decades, the country has become the world’s 17th largest economy – and the largest in Southeast Asia.
Fueled by higher household consumption, it held its place among ASEAN countries as the leading destination for foreign direct investment in the first quarter of 2025, raking in roughly $13.7 billion
with a 12.7 percent annual increase. Annual economic growth rose to 5.12 percent in the second quarter of 2025 from 4.87 percent in the first. Data from Indonesia’s statistics bureau show that the
second-quarter growth rate was the fastest since 2023.
Some of this economic success owes to geography. Its strategic position allows Jakarta to control crucial maritime routes such as the Strait of Malacca, through which 40 percent of global trade passes
annually. Indonesia’s diplomatic efforts as a leader in ASEAN, as well as its active role in international diplomacy, have secured its position as an influential middle power. That it accounts for
almost half of global nickel production also makes it a key player in the global supply chain and a valuable partner to both China and the United States.
But domestic pressure and the general uncertainty over the global economy could put Indonesia’s future in jeopardy. President Prabowo Subianto, who took office in October 2024, has adopted
ambitious, large-scale economic measures driven by concerns over food and energy security. Prabowo’s new agenda has included rice subsidies for 18.3 million low-income households, electricity
discounts for 79.3 million families, income tax exemptions for workers earning up to $606 per month, and the allocation of $7.5 billion (4 percent of the 2025 state budget) to provide free school
meals nationwide. These measures provide short-term economic improvement, but over the long term, they could strain Indonesia’s budget as growth slows. Without more fiscal discipline, Indonesia
risks long-term fragility and weakened investor confidence, the effects of which will be especially pronounced in poorer, rural areas.
Meanwhile, Indonesia is in the middle of the U.S.-China competition. In terms of trade relations, both countries are crucial for Jakarta. China has been Indonesia’s biggest trade partner for the
past decade, with bilateral trade exceeding $137 billion last year. Chinese trade accounted for approximately 27 percent of Indonesia’s overall trade volume, led by $62 billion in Indonesian exports
predominantly in natural resources such as nickel, coal, palm oil and natural gas, as well as $72 billion in imports, mostly machinery, electronics, and industrial goods essential to Indonesia’s
infrastructure and production needs. Trade with the U.S. stood at approximately $38.5 billion in 2024. The United States is still an important market for Indonesia’s labor-intensive exports:
electronics, textiles, footwear and furniture. Under the U.S. trade deal, Indonesia has agreed to purchase agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communications technology,
automotive products and chemicals. The tariff-free supply of agricultural and energy products will likely improve Indonesia’s current food and energy problems while providing unprecedented access
for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, tech companies and service providers to the Indonesian market. And because Indonesia wants to promote its manufacturing and tech industries, this part of the deal is a
win-win.

Still, concerns remain that aligning too closely with the U.S. will hurt Indonesia’s strategic independence. After all, it can’t afford to alienate its largest trading partner in China. But
Indonesia’s ties with China are far more complex than a simple trade relationship. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has largely failed to bring the economic benefits it promised to ASEAN
nations, has been comparatively successful in Indonesia. It brought about major infrastructure and industrial projects like the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail and the Morowali Industrial Park. It
also brought along negative consequences. For example, though Indonesia is the world leader in nickel, the nickel sector has become dominated by Chinese firms; companies such as Tsingshan Holding
Group and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry control more than 70 percent of refining capacity and more than 90 percent of mining concessions. Indonesia is thus more dependent on Chinese technology and
capital than its leaders would like. The government recently formed a task force to downstream the mineral industry through domestic financing, and it has enforced some new regulations that place
limits on foreign ownership.
These measures will not be enough to reduce Chinese influence in the short term, so Indonesia is looking to the U.S. to balance things out. This is why it’s trying to renegotiate key export products
with the U.S., namely labor-intensive sectors such as textiles, footwear and electronics. (This wouldn’t replace China in terms of volume, but it can alleviate some of Indonesia’s concerns about
the influx of goods that Beijing has been funneling into the country in an attempt to avoid U.S. tariffs.) But perhaps the most crucial sector for Jakarta right now is critical minerals, particularly
copper, which is needed for electric vehicles, semiconductors and clean energy infrastructure. Indonesia has an estimated 21 million metric tons of copper reserves, the seventh-largest in the world.
In 2024 alone, it matched U.S. copper production at 1.1 million tons. (Its reserves could entice the U.S. to diversify away from Latin American supplies, so long as Indonesia doesn’t ban the export
of raw minerals as it has in the past.) With copper’s growing role in the global value chain in mind, the government has established the world’s largest single-line copper smelter. The U.S. has
apparently agreed to grant zero percent tariffs on Indonesian copper, and for good reason. As it is working on diversifying supply chains away from China, Indonesia’s increasingly refined copper is
considered a perfect alternative – especially as global demand for copper is expected to double in the next 10 years.
Trump has said that under the tariff deal, the U.S. has gained “full access” to Indonesia’s mineral sector, including its copper reserves. And the U.S. has apparently agreed to grant zero
percent tariffs on Indonesian copper to both obtain more of the mineral from Indonesia and to deny it to China. But it’s unclear what “full access” means. The U.S. already has a significant
stake in Indonesia’s copper industry: Freeport Indonesia, a mining company mainly focused on extracting and processing copper, gold and silver, is partially owned (48.8 percent) by U.S.-based
Freeport-McMoRan. Indonesia does not want the U.S. to dominate its copper sector any more than it wants China to dominate its nickel sector. Therefore, any trade negotiation between Jakarta and
Washington will most likely concern not only lower tariffs on export products but also potential ways Indonesia can retain some control over its mineral industry – which it can do by developing new
mines, maintaining some export restrictions, and further boosting its production and refining capacity – without angering the U.S. or endangering its stakes.
It's in Indonesia’s best interest to maintain as much strategic autonomy and maneuverability as it can, and to refrain from being over-aligned with either China or the U.S. Certainly, there is a
military element to this strategy. But so far, Jakarta has managed to maintain a balance between Beijing and Washington, pushing back when it needed to – in China’s case, regarding its aggressive
activities in the South China Sea, while in the U.S.’ case, continuously defending its rights in tariff negotiations – without openly provoking either of them. Its influence in ASEAN and its
relationships with other powers like Japan and India will help it maintain some sense of independence. Indonesia can’t quit China or the U.S., but if it plays its cards right, it should be able to
maintain its status.

ities and $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite public pra=
ise of the deal from Indonesia=E2=80=99s president, reports indicate that J=
akarta is still in talks with Washington to secure lower rates for certain =
products. The fact that Indonesia has chosen to continue negotiating signal=
s its dissatisfaction with the deal already in place. Good political ties w=
ith the U.S will help Indonesia maintain a position in the Association of S=
outheast Asian Nations, but it still needs to stabilize its economy and min=
imize its vulnerability to the changes in export markets. This means Jakart=
a will want to reach a favorable trade deal, elements of which it can use f=
or its own advantage while avoiding overdependence on a bigger power.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Not that Indonesia=
 is in any danger of economic collapse anytime soon. Over the past few deca=
des, the country has become the world=E2=80=99s 17th largest economy =E2=80=
=93 and the largest in Southeast Asia. Fueled by higher household consumpti=
on, it held its place among ASEAN countries as the leading destination for =
foreign direct investment in the first quarter of 2025, raking in roughly $=
13.7 billion with a 12.7 percent annual increase. Annual economic growth ro=
se to 5.12 percent in the second quarter of 2025 from 4.87 percent in the f=
irst. Data from Indonesia=E2=80=99s statistics bureau show that the second-=
quarter growth rate was the fastest since 2023.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Some of this econo=
mic success owes to geography. Its strategic position allows Jakarta to con=
trol crucial maritime routes such as the Strait of Malacca, through which 4=
0 percent of global trade passes annually. Indonesia=E2=80=99s diplomatic e=
fforts as a leader in ASEAN, as well as its active role in international di=
plomacy, have secured its position as an influential middle power. That it =
accounts for almost half of global nickel production also makes it a key pl=
ayer in the global supply chain and a valuable partner to both China and th=
e United States.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But domestic press=
ure and the general uncertainty over the global economy could put Indonesia=
=E2=80=99s future in jeopardy. President Prabowo Subianto, who took office =
in October 2024, has adopted ambitious, large-scale economic measures drive=
n by concerns over food and energy security. Prabowo=E2=80=99s new agenda h=
as included rice subsidies for 18.3 million low-income households, electric=
ity discounts for 79.3 million families, income tax exemptions for workers =
earning up to $606 per month, and the allocation of $7.5 billion (4 percent=
 of the 2025 state budget) to provide free school meals nationwide. These m=
easures provide short-term economic improvement, but over the long term, th=
ey could strain Indonesia=E2=80=99s budget as growth slows. Without more fi=
scal discipline, Indonesia risks long-term fragility and weakened investor =
confidence, the effects of which will be especially pronounced in poorer, r=
ural areas.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, Indones=
ia is in the middle of the U.S.-China competition. In terms of trade relati=
ons, both countries are crucial for Jakarta. China has been Indonesia=E2=80=
=99s biggest trade partner for the past decade, with bilateral trade exceed=
ing $137 billion last year. Chinese trade accounted for approximately 27 pe=
rcent of Indonesia=E2=80=99s overall trade volume, led by $62 billion in In=
donesian exports predominantly in natural resources such as nickel, coal, p=
alm oil and natural gas, as well as $72 billion in imports, mostly machiner=
y, electronics, and industrial goods essential to Indonesia=E2=80=99s infra=
structure and production needs. Trade with the U.S. stood at approximately =
$38.5 billion in 2024. The United States is still an important market for I=
ndonesia=E2=80=99s labor-intensive exports: electronics, textiles, footwear=
 and furniture. Under the U.S. trade deal, Indonesia has agreed to purchase=
 agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communica=
tions technology, automotive products and chemicals. The tariff-free supply=
 of agricultural and energy products will likely improve Indonesia=E2=80=99=
s current food and energy problems while providing unprecedented access for=
 U.S. farmers, manufacturers, tech companies and service providers to the I=
ndonesian market. And because Indonesia wants to promote its manufacturing =
and tech industries, this part of the deal is a win-win.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Still, concerns re=
main that aligning too closely with the U.S. will hurt Indonesia=E2=80=99s =
strategic independence. After all, it can=E2=80=99t afford to alienate its =
largest trading partner in China. But Indonesia=E2=80=99s ties with China a=
re far more complex than a simple trade relationship. China=E2=80=99s Belt =
and Road Initiative, which has largely failed to bring the economic benefit=
s it promised to ASEAN nations, has been comparatively successful in Indone=
sia. It brought about major infrastructure and industrial projects like the=
 Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail and the Morowali Industrial Park. It also =
brought along negative consequences. For example, though Indonesia is the w=
orld leader in nickel, the nickel sector has become dominated by Chinese fi=
rms; companies such as Tsingshan Holding Group and Jiangsu Delong Nickel In=
dustry control more than 70 percent of refining capacity and more than 90 p=
ercent of mining concessions. Indonesia is thus more dependent on Chinese t=
echnology and capital than its leaders would like. The government recently =
formed a task force to downstream the mineral industry through domestic fin=
ancing, and it has enforced some new regulations that place limits on forei=
gn ownership.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">These measures wil=
l not be enough to reduce Chinese influence in the short term, so Indonesia=
 is looking to the U.S. to balance things out. This is why it=E2=80=99s try=
ing to renegotiate key export products with the U.S., namely labor-intensiv=
e sectors such as textiles, footwear and electronics. (This wouldn=E2=80=99=
t replace China in terms of volume, but it can alleviate some of Indonesia=
=E2=80=99s concerns about the influx of goods that Beijing has been funneli=
ng into the country in an attempt to avoid U.S. tariffs.) But perhaps the m=
ost crucial sector for Jakarta right now is critical minerals, particularly=
 copper, which is needed for electric vehicles, semiconductors and clean en=
ergy infrastructure. Indonesia has an estimated 21 million metric tons of c=
opper reserves, the seventh-largest in the world. In 2024 alone, it matched=
 U.S. copper production at 1.1 million tons. (Its reserves could entice the=
 U.S. to diversify away from Latin American supplies, so long as Indonesia =
doesn=E2=80=99t ban the export of raw minerals as it has in the past.) With=
 copper=E2=80=99s growing role in the global value chain in mind, the gover=
nment has established the world=E2=80=99s largest single-line copper smelte=
r. The U.S. has apparently agreed to grant zero percent tariffs on Indonesi=
an copper, and for good reason. As it is working on diversifying supply cha=
ins away from China, Indonesia=E2=80=99s increasingly refined copper is con=
sidered a perfect alternative =E2=80=93 especially as global demand for cop=
per is expected to double in the next 10 years.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Trump has said tha=
t under the tariff deal, the U.S. has gained =E2=80=9Cfull access=E2=80=9D =
to Indonesia=E2=80=99s mineral sector, including its copper reserves. And t=
he U.S. has apparently agreed to grant zero percent tariffs on Indonesian c=
opper to both obtain more of the mineral from Indonesia and to deny it to C=
hina. But it=E2=80=99s unclear what =E2=80=9Cfull access=E2=80=9D means. Th=
e U.S. already has a significant stake in Indonesia=E2=80=99s copper indust=
ry: Freeport Indonesia, a mining company mainly focused on extracting and p=
rocessing copper, gold and silver, is partially owned (48.8 percent) by U.S=
.-based Freeport-McMoRan. Indonesia does not want the U.S. to dominate its =
copper sector any more than it wants China to dominate its nickel sector. T=
herefore, any trade negotiation between Jakarta and Washington will most li=
kely concern not only lower tariffs on export products but also potential w=
ays Indonesia can retain some control over its mineral industry =E2=80=93 w=
hich it can do by developing new mines, maintaining some export restriction=
s, and further boosting its production and refining capacity =E2=80=93 with=
out angering the U.S. or endangering its stakes.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It's in Indonesia=
=E2=80=99s best interest to maintain as much strategic autonomy and maneuve=
rability as it can, and to refrain from being over-aligned with either Chin=
a or the U.S. Certainly, there is a military element to this strategy. But =
so far, Jakarta has managed to maintain a balance between Beijing and Washi=
ngton, pushing back when it needed to =E2=80=93 in China=E2=80=99s case, re=
garding its aggressive activities in the South China Sea, while in the U.S.=
=E2=80=99 case, continuously defending its rights in tariff negotiations =
=E2=80=93 without openly provoking either of them. Its influence in ASEAN a=
nd its relationships with other powers like Japan and India will help it ma=
intain some sense of independence. Indonesia can=E2=80=99t quit China or th=
e U.S., but if it plays its cards right, it should be able to maintain its =
status.</p>
