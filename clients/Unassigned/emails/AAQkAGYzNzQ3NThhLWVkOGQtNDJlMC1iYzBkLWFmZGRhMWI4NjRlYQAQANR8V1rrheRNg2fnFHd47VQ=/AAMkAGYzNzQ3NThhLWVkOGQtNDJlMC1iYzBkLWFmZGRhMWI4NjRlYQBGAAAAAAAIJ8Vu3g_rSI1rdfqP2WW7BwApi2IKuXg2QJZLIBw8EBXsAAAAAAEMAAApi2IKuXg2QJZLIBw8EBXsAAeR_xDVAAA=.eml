EUROPE RECONSIDERS ITS APPROACH TO SANCTIONS ENFORCEMENT [3]
THE BORACAY CASE COULD BE A PRECEDENT FOR A NEW EUROPEAN COURSE OF ACTION.
BY: ANTONIA COLIBASANU
Over the past week, a series of incidents underscored growing concerns over European security and hybrid threats. In Germany, Munich Airport was forced to shut down twice after multiple drone
sightings, grounding dozens of flights and prompting emergency measures to detect and neutralize unmanned aircraft. Although no entity has claimed responsibility, officials in Berlin suspect a foreign
intelligence link amid several recent unexplained drone incursions over European airspace. Perhaps more importantly, the French navy intercepted on Oct. 1 the Russia-linked Boracay oil tanker off the
coast of Saint-Nazaire and detained its captain, alleging that the vessel was part of Moscow’s “shadow fleet.”
The ship, loaded with as much as 750,000 barrels of crude, had departed from Russia’s Primorsk terminal and was reportedly bound for India. It was flying the flag of Benin, though investigators
suspect the registration was either false or invalid. The ship’s captain, a Chinese national, was released but has been charged and is scheduled to stand trial in France in February 2026. Earlier
this year, the same ship was detained in Estonia for documentation irregularities and a lack of proper registration. It was operating under the name Kiwala at the time; shadow fleet vessels regularly
change names and flags to conceal ownership and evade sanctions.
With the seizure, the West’s approach to sanctions enforcement could be shifting. President Emmanuel Macron has framed the interception as a necessary step to disrupt the trade of Russian oil above
a price cap set by the European Union and cut into the revenues sustaining Russia’s war against Ukraine. He also did not rule out a link between unidentified drones spotted last month flying above
military sites and near airports in Denmark and the Boracay, which was sailing nearby at the time. French and Danish investigators are looking into a possible connection.
Until the Boracay’s detention, Western governments had relied primarily on banks, insurers and flag registries to enforce sanctions designed to restrict Russia’s oil exports. The only notable
exception was a Finnish case [4] in which the captain and two officers of a suspected shadow fleet oil tanker were accused of damaging undersea power and internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The
incident could have paved a path to enforcing sanctions in the maritime domain, but last week, a court dismissed the case, saying Finland had no jurisdiction to prosecute the individuals, underscoring
the legal challenges to law enforcement at sea.
What makes Boracay potentially different is the broader context: In recent months, a surge of unexplained drone activity across European airspace and maritime corridors has enmeshed sanctions evasion
in a hybrid security issue, at a time when tensions between Russia and the West show no sign of easing. In such an environment, a shadow fleet tanker with opaque ownership and proximity to recent
drone incursions is no longer merely a sanctions risk. Indeed, these vessels can be multi-use platforms – able to conduct reconnaissance and electronic support missions or launch operations behind
commercial traffic. The heightened risk lowers political barriers to law enforcement measures at sea (including boarding, seizure or extended inspection) and elevates the legal requirements
authorities are willing to accept for intervention.
Boracay has thus become a test case for more proactive maritime action than Europe previously tolerated. With Paris taking the lead role, this could signal that EU enforcement won’t rely only on
insurers and banks going forward. If other EU (and NATO) coastal states follow suit, a coordinated approach to shadow fleet interdictions could take shape, raising the risks and operating costs for
Russia-linked oil flows. So far, there are several signals pointing in this direction. According to EUobserver [5], European policymakers are preparing new legal mechanisms that would allow the EU and
member states to interdict at least another 16 tankers suspected of belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet if they enter the Baltic Sea.
If sanctions circumvention is no longer a low-risk endeavor, especially in European waters, then shadow fleet vessels may be forced to sail farther offshore, operate for longer periods with their
Automatic Identification System transceivers off and rely more on permissive jurisdictions. Insurance premiums would rise, and more vessels could go without adequate coverage, exposing them to
commercial and legal liabilities. This would not stop Russian oil exports, but it would reduce margins, delay shipments and complicate Moscow’s wartime finances.
However, this all depends on how the Boracay case plays out legally. What ensues will be a test case for the application of international and domestic maritime law against vessels with fraudulent
flags or opaque ownership. Additionally, the complex investigative methods involved (e.g., flag verification, AIS forensics and cargo tracing) could be applied to other types of illicit trade,
strengthening enforcement of arms embargoes or restrictions on dual-use technology transfers.
The Boracay case also presents an alternative to the approach to sanctions enforcement promoted by Washington. In August, the Trump administration announced 50 percent tariffs on India over its
purchases of Russian oil, and it has pushed Europe to do the same against Russian oil’s two biggest customers: India and China. However, if France proves the feasibility of disrupting Russia’s
shadow fleet network through interdiction, then it could increase the costs and uncertainty for Moscow’s Indian and Chinese clients without directly provoking them. Europeans will likely argue that
such an approach better balances strategic pressure and political prudence, since it focuses pain on the supply chain rather than the customer.
Of course, the Kremlin is unlikely to ignore this challenge to its shadow fleet. Russia will likely escalate its hybrid tactics: harassing European shipping, deploying GPS spoofing or jamming in key
sea lanes, or sabotaging undersea infrastructure. These are tactics Russia has employed in the Black Sea since it seized Crimea in 2014. They are cheap and deniable, enabling Moscow to defend its near
abroad while probing NATO’s and the EU’s thresholds for response. To counter these tactics, European countries will need to coordinate across several domains – a difficult task but cheaper than
an open conflict with Russia.
The Boracay seizure is significant because of the precedent it sets. France has transformed sanctions enforcement from a regulatory exercise into a maritime security operation, embedding economic
warfare within naval practice. The case highlights the interconnection of sanctions circumvention, hybrid threats and geopolitical competition at sea. If Europe builds on this moment, it could develop
a more resilient and proactive maritime posture – one that raises costs for Russia while also demonstrating that European security does not end at the shoreline. While still aligning with U.S.
strategy, Europe is avoiding going after buyers directly, instead targeting Russia’s export lifelines and the logistical enablers of its energy trade.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Over the past week=
, a series of incidents underscored growing concerns over European security=
 and hybrid threats. In Germany, Munich Airport was forced to shut down twi=
ce after multiple drone sightings, grounding dozens of flights and promptin=
g emergency measures to detect and neutralize unmanned aircraft. Although n=
o entity has claimed responsibility, officials in Berlin suspect a foreign =
intelligence link amid several recent unexplained drone incursions over Eur=
opean airspace. Perhaps more importantly, the French navy intercepted on Oc=
t. 1 the Russia-linked Boracay oil tanker off the coast of Saint-Nazaire an=
d detained its captain, alleging that the vessel was part of Moscow=E2=80=
=99s =E2=80=9Cshadow fleet.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The ship, loaded w=
ith as much as 750,000 barrels of crude, had departed from Russia=E2=80=99s=
 Primorsk terminal and was reportedly bound for India. It was flying the fl=
ag of Benin, though investigators suspect the registration was either false=
 or invalid. The ship=E2=80=99s captain, a Chinese national, was released b=
ut has been charged and is scheduled to stand trial in France in February 2=
026. Earlier this year, the same ship was detained in Estonia for documenta=
tion irregularities and a lack of proper registration. It was operating und=
er the name Kiwala at the time; shadow fleet vessels regularly change names=
 and flags to conceal ownership and evade sanctions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With the seizure, =
the West=E2=80=99s approach to sanctions enforcement could be shifting. Pre=
sident Emmanuel Macron has framed the interception as a necessary step to d=
isrupt the trade of Russian oil above a price cap set by the European Union=
 and cut into the revenues sustaining Russia=E2=80=99s war against Ukraine.=
 He also did not rule out a link between unidentified drones spotted last m=
onth flying above military sites and near airports in Denmark and the Borac=
ay, which was sailing nearby at the time. French and Danish investigators a=
re looking into a possible connection.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Until the Boracay=
=E2=80=99s detention, Western governments had relied primarily on banks, in=
surers and flag registries to enforce sanctions designed to restrict Russia=
=E2=80=99s oil exports. The only notable exception was a<a href=3D"https://=
geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/414215/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aH=
R0cHM6Ly93d3cuZHcuY29tL2VuL2ZpbmxhbmQtY291cnQtZGlzbWlzc2VzLWJhbHRpYy1jYWJsZ=
S1jdXRzLWNhc2Utb3Zlci1qdXJpc2RpY3Rpb24vYS03NDIyNjEwOQ" style=3D"color:#0e6b=
a5;text-decoration:none;padding:2px 0px"> Finnish case</a> in which the cap=
tain and two officers of a suspected shadow fleet oil tanker were accused o=
f damaging undersea power and internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The incide=
nt could have paved a path to enforcing sanctions in the maritime domain, b=
ut last week, a court dismissed the case, saying Finland had no jurisdictio=
n to prosecute the individuals, underscoring the legal challenges to law en=
forcement at sea.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">What makes Boracay=
 potentially different is the broader context: In recent months, a surge of=
 unexplained drone activity across European airspace and maritime corridors=
 has enmeshed sanctions evasion in a hybrid security issue, at a time when =
tensions between Russia and the West show no sign of easing. In such an env=
ironment, a shadow fleet tanker with opaque ownership and proximity to rece=
nt drone incursions is no longer merely a sanctions risk. Indeed, these ves=
sels can be multi-use platforms =E2=80=93 able to conduct reconnaissance an=
d electronic support missions or launch operations behind commercial traffi=
c. The heightened risk lowers political barriers to law enforcement measure=
s at sea (including boarding, seizure or extended inspection) and elevates =
the legal requirements authorities are willing to accept for intervention.<=
/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Boracay has thus b=
ecome a test case for more proactive maritime action than Europe previously=
 tolerated. With Paris taking the lead role, this could signal that EU enfo=
rcement won=E2=80=99t rely only on insurers and banks going forward. If oth=
er EU (and NATO) coastal states follow suit, a coordinated approach to shad=
ow fleet interdictions could take shape, raising the risks and operating co=
sts for Russia-linked oil flows. So far, there are several signals pointing=
 in this direction. According to <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com=
/mailster/414215/5e27030c0318f096cd26f3e94fdcf2a7/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldW9ic2VydmVyL=
mNvbS9ldS1hbmQtdGhlLXdvcmxkL2FyNzYxMTI5YTE" style=3D"color:#0e6ba5;text-dec=
oration:none;padding:2px 0px">EUobserver</a>, European policymakers are pre=
paring new legal mechanisms that would allow the EU and member states to in=
terdict at least another 16 tankers suspected of belonging to Russia=E2=80=
=99s shadow fleet if they enter the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">If sanctions circu=
mvention is no longer a low-risk endeavor, especially in European waters, t=
hen shadow fleet vessels may be forced to sail farther offshore, operate fo=
r longer periods with their Automatic Identification System transceivers of=
f and rely more on permissive jurisdictions. Insurance premiums would rise,=
 and more vessels could go without adequate coverage, exposing them to comm=
ercial and legal liabilities. This would not stop Russian oil exports, but =
it would reduce margins, delay shipments and complicate Moscow=E2=80=99s wa=
rtime finances.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, this all =
depends on how the Boracay case plays out legally. What ensues will be a te=
st case for the application of international and domestic maritime law agai=
nst vessels with fraudulent flags or opaque ownership. Additionally, the co=
mplex investigative methods involved (e.g., flag verification, AIS forensic=
s and cargo tracing) could be applied to other types of illicit trade, stre=
ngthening enforcement of arms embargoes or restrictions on dual-use technol=
ogy transfers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Boracay case a=
lso presents an alternative to the approach to sanctions enforcement promot=
ed by Washington. In August, the Trump administration announced 50 percent =
tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil, and it has pushed Europ=
e to do the same against Russian oil=E2=80=99s two biggest customers: India=
 and China. However, if France proves the feasibility of disrupting Russia=
=E2=80=99s shadow fleet network through interdiction, then it could increas=
e the costs and uncertainty for Moscow=E2=80=99s Indian and Chinese clients=
 without directly provoking them. Europeans will likely argue that such an =
approach better balances strategic pressure and political prudence, since i=
t focuses pain on the supply chain rather than the customer.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Of course, the Kre=
mlin is unlikely to ignore this challenge to its shadow fleet. Russia will =
likely escalate its hybrid tactics: harassing European shipping, deploying =
GPS spoofing or jamming in key sea lanes, or sabotaging undersea infrastruc=
ture. These are tactics Russia has employed in the Black Sea since it seize=
d Crimea in 2014. They are cheap and deniable, enabling Moscow to defend it=
s near abroad while probing NATO=E2=80=99s and the EU=E2=80=99s thresholds =
for response. To counter these tactics, European countries will need to coo=
rdinate across several domains =E2=80=93 a difficult task but cheaper than =
an open conflict with Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Boracay seizur=
e is significant because of the precedent it sets. France has transformed s=
anctions enforcement from a regulatory exercise into a maritime security op=
eration, embedding economic warfare within naval practice. The case highlig=
hts the interconnection of sanctions circumvention, hybrid threats and geop=
olitical competition at sea. If Europe builds on this moment, it could deve=
lop a more resilient and proactive maritime posture =E2=80=93 one that rais=
es costs for Russia while also demonstrating that European security does no=
t end at the shoreline. While still aligning with U.S. strategy, Europe is =
avoiding going after buyers directly, instead targeting Russia=E2=80=99s ex=
port lifelines and the logistical enablers of its energy trade.</p>
