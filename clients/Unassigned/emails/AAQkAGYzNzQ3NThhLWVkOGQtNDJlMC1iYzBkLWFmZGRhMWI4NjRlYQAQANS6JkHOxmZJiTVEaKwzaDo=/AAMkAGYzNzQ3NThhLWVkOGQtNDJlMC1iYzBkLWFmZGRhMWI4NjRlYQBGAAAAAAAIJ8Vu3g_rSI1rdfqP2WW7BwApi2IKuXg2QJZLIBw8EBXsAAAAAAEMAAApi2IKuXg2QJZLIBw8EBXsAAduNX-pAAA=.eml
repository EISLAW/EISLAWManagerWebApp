RISK AND REWARD IN THE AI ARMS RACE [3]
WHEN IT COMES TO WARFARE, SPEED IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PERFECT RELIABILITY.
BY: ANDREW DAVIDSON
Artificial intelligence is emerging as the strategic high ground in warfare, promising faster targeting, smarter weapons and operations beyond human capacity. Several imperatives are driving its
adoption: the split-second engagement speeds needed to counter hypersonic weapons and drone swarms; the ability to fuse radar, infrared, electronic and satellite feeds into a real-time battlespace
picture; and the force-multiplying effect that enables smaller forces to contest vast areas. In this coming era, purely human-controlled forces are at a disadvantage in speed, coordination and scale.
But while the potential value of AI is obvious, its readiness for deployment and the wisdom of some uses remain subject to debate. Critics warn of flawed data, exploitable algorithms and unpredictable
failures. Nevertheless, in most operations, the need to match or outpace the adversary wins out over the pursuit of perfect systems. The AI arms race is no different, producing what might be called
compressed-risk adoption: fast-tracking development and deployment and integrating AI into high-tempo domains before it is fully mature.
DRIVERS OF THE AI ARMS RACE
Since military AI systems have not been tested against peer competitors, states often decide on adoption on the basis of incomplete or ambiguous intelligence. This creates a feedback loop in which any
credible sign of advancement – whether from exercises, demonstrations or open-source reporting – pushes others to accelerate development, regardless of actual readiness. Decision-makers expect
that the next major conflict will include hypersonic salvos, autonomous swarms, and contested space and cyber domains, favoring those who can act and adapt quickest.
The strongest military powers are already preparing. China’s intelligentized warfare doctrine seeks to control the pace of decision-making so the enemy is always reacting, never acting. The United
States’ Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) approach seeks to compress the time between sensing and shooting at targets. And Russia, constrained by sanctions and a narrower research base
than China or the U.S., is adapting commercially available AI, such as image recognition models and navigation algorithms, for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) denial and targeting
support. In Ukraine, these tools have appeared in limited, often improvised applications, such as automating drone reconnaissance analysis or assisting electronic warfare targeting. While far from
decisive, even modest improvements can complicate NATO’s ISR and precision-strike advantage if scaled or paired with effective deception tactics.
Speed is the most significant factor driving AI adoption. Massed missile and hypersonic attacks unfold too quickly for traditional review cycles, pushing missile defense toward AI systems that fuse
sensor data within milliseconds. Errors might be noticed only after engagement. Manpower limitations and the pressures of alliance interoperability are additional factors. Japan, for example, has
directly linked AI integration with its need to compensate for demographic realities. For alliances such as NATO and AUKUS, members that fall behind in using AI to do things like share targeting data
or operate in coordinated formations risk creating seams in coalition operations that an enemy could exploit.
Finally, militaries are eager to exploit commercial AI breakthroughs in image recognition, navigation and automation. AI promises to shorten development cycles and cut costs, enabling rapid adaptation
for combat use. Unlike past eras, when technology like GPS began in military programs, today’s advances are largely commercial, creating incentives to deploy before rigorous testing in the chaos of
combat.
PLANNED USES
Military AI programs are concentrating in three primary areas: missile defense, ISR fusion and swarm coordination – domains where speed is vital. These are also the areas where competitive pressure
makes the compressed-risk adoption model most visible.
Missile defense remains the most prominent testing ground. AI can process radar and infrared inputs, distinguish between targets and make intercept decisions in milliseconds – which is essential for
countering hypersonic glide vehicles or massed ballistic launches. The U.S. is testing AI programs to integrate its Aegis and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) systems across layered
defenses, and China’s HQ-19 high-altitude interceptor likely pursues similar automation for advanced missile threats. In both cases, operational urgency is driving deployment before AI systems have
proved their reliability, particularly in degraded sensor environments.
ISR fusion is the second major focus. By integrating satellite imagery, radar sweeps, signals intelligence and battlefield sensors, AI can rapidly create a unified picture of the area of operation.
NATO’s federated mission networking and the U.S. JADC2 program aim to accelerate targeting and shorten kill chains, while China is developing equivalent systems to give its forces a real-time shared
operating picture in the Western Pacific. The complexity of these networks makes them vulnerable to data corruption and spoofing, but their speed advantage ensures they will be used regardless.
A third priority is swarm coordination, where AI manages large groups of unmanned vehicles – dynamically retasking units, adapting formations and overwhelming defenses without direct human
involvement. The U.S.’ OFFSET (OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics) program, swarm demonstrations by the China Electronics Technology Group Corp. and reported Russian experiments in Ukraine all point to
swarming as a near-term capability race. Here, too, deployment is moving ahead even as militaries explore how to control escalation risks when large autonomous formations are in play.
Other applications are also advancing. Cyber-AI hybrids promise to detect and counter intrusions at machine speed, potentially shifting the balance between offense and defense in cyberwarfare. In
logistics, countries are exploring predictive maintenance and adaptive supply routing to sustain dispersed forces under persistent attack. AI is also being adapted to attack rival systems, using
cyber, electronic warfare and data corruption to force misclassification or disruption, and pushing each side to harden its own AI as fast as it builds it. In each case, competitive urgency, not
perfected safeguards, is forcing adoption.
VULNERABILITIES: LESSONS FROM HISTORY
The same competitive pressures that drive rapid AI adoption also magnify its vulnerabilities. AI targeting and decision-making systems are only as reliable as the data they process – bad data in
means bad data out. In contested environments, adversaries can corrupt inputs through sensor spoofing (feeding false radar, infrared or GPS signals), data poisoning (manipulating training data or live
feeds), cyber intrusion (altering targeting parameters) or environmental manipulation (using decoys, camouflage or electronic warfare). These tactics can degrade performance or even cause friendly
forces to be misclassified as threats, turning AI’s speed into a liability.
Beyond technical weaknesses, procedural gaps create additional hazards. Forces may adopt AI faster than they adapt their rules of engagement or training, leading them to place too much trust in AI
during ambiguous situations. In politically tense theaters, an autonomous misfire could escalate a crisis in seconds.
Material realities also limit how far and fast AI can be deployed. High-performance processors, secure communications networks and advanced sensors depend on supply lines that can be disrupted or
denied in combat. Supply chains are often global, fragile and outside direct military control, meaning that a well-timed interdiction, embargo or cyberattack on a single supplier can rapidly degrade
frontline AI performance. In high-tempo operations, even short interruptions can strip forces of critical capabilities, making supply chain security an operational vulnerability as much as a
logistical one.
Finally, even when successfully fielded, AI will operate in contested environments. Counter-AI warfare – blending electronic warfare, cyber operations and deception – can corrupt targeting data or
redirect assets, effectively turning advanced capabilities against their operators. These vulnerabilities reflect a broader pattern seen in earlier automation failures, where adversaries or
environmental factors exploited system speed before safeguards could respond. The combination of early deployment and active contestation makes it plausible that an AI-driven error could trigger a
crisis with little warning – an outcome that would test military restraint and alliance cohesion under extreme time pressure.
History shows that the rush to field automation without fully accounting for its limits can create as many risks as advantages. In March 2003, during the Iraq War, a U.S. Patriot air defense battery
wrongly classified a British Tornado returning to base as an incoming anti-radiation missile. With less than a minute to react, the Patriot’s crew destroyed the aircraft, killing both pilots. Though
a human authorized the launch, the compressed engagement timeline and automation-driven classification left little room for questioning the result.
Past failures in other sectors, from civil aviation (the 737 MAX crashes) to financial trading (the 2010 “flash crash”), show the same pattern: Once trusted to act at high speed with minimal
oversight, systems can fail faster than humans can detect or correct them. In a military context, competitive pressure means such vulnerabilities will not halt deployment; they will simply be managed
in parallel.
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
The AI arms race is not about perfecting machines – it is about deploying them fast enough to deny rivals a decisive advantage in speed or scale. This is the compressed-risk adoption model:
integrating AI into high-tempo operations before it is fully proven, collapsing the time between development, deployment and combat exposure.
History shows that once a technology is trusted to act at high speed with minimal oversight, flaws and exploitation are inevitable. In today’s competitive environment, these vulnerabilities will not
slow adoption but will be accepted as the operational cost of keeping pace. Counter-AI warfare – exploiting AI’s dependence on clean, trustworthy data – will emerge as a formal discipline, with
the potential to degrade capabilities in real time and erode confidence in their use.
Deployment speed and resilience will decide who holds the advantage. Speed delivers early gains, but only those with secure supply chains, industrial depth and the ability to absorb losses can sustain
capability under contestation. Nations that dominate the production of processors, secure communications and advanced sensors will hold lasting leverage, able to deny rivals access, surge in crises
and dictate terms.
In a cycle where adoption drives countermeasures and countermeasures drive further adoption, the greater danger is falling behind – not accepting early vulnerabilities. The winners will be those who
move fastest while maintaining control.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Artificial intelli=
gence is emerging as the strategic high ground in warfare, promising faster=
 targeting, smarter weapons and operations beyond human capacity. Several i=
mperatives are driving its adoption: the split-second engagement speeds nee=
ded to counter hypersonic weapons and drone swarms; the ability to fuse rad=
ar, infrared, electronic and satellite feeds into a real-time battlespace p=
icture; and the force-multiplying effect that enables smaller forces to con=
test vast areas. In this coming era, purely human-controlled forces are at =
a disadvantage in speed, coordination and scale.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But while the pote=
ntial value of AI is obvious, its readiness for deployment and the wisdom o=
f some uses remain subject to debate. Critics warn of flawed data, exploita=
ble algorithms and unpredictable failures. Nevertheless, in most operations=
, the need to match or outpace the adversary wins out over the pursuit of p=
erfect systems. The AI arms race is no different, producing what might be c=
alled compressed-risk adoption: fast-tracking development and deployment an=
d integrating AI into high-tempo domains before it is fully mature.</p>

systems have not been tested against peer competitors, states often decide =
on adoption on the basis of incomplete or ambiguous intelligence. This crea=
tes a feedback loop in which any credible sign of advancement =E2=80=93 whe=
ther from exercises, demonstrations or open-source reporting =E2=80=93 push=
es others to accelerate development, regardless of actual readiness. Decisi=
on-makers expect that the next major conflict will include hypersonic salvo=
s, autonomous swarms, and contested space and cyber domains, favoring those=
 who can act and adapt quickest.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The strongest mili=
tary powers are already preparing. China=E2=80=99s intelligentized warfare =
doctrine seeks to control the pace of decision-making so the enemy is alway=
s reacting, never acting. The United States=E2=80=99 Joint All-Domain Comma=
nd and Control (JADC2) approach seeks to compress the time between sensing =
and shooting at targets. And Russia, constrained by sanctions and a narrowe=
r research base than China or the U.S., is adapting commercially available =
AI, such as image recognition models and navigation algorithms, for intelli=
gence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) denial and targeting support. =
In Ukraine, these tools have appeared in limited, often improvised applicat=
ions, such as automating drone reconnaissance analysis or assisting electro=
nic warfare targeting. While far from decisive, even modest improvements ca=
n complicate NATO=E2=80=99s ISR and precision-strike advantage if scaled or=
 paired with effective deception tactics.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Speed is the most =
significant factor driving AI adoption. Massed missile and hypersonic attac=
ks unfold too quickly for traditional review cycles, pushing missile defens=
e toward AI systems that fuse sensor data within milliseconds. Errors might=
 be noticed only after engagement. Manpower limitations and the pressures o=
f alliance interoperability are additional factors. Japan, for example, has=
 directly linked AI integration with its need to compensate for demographic=
 realities. For alliances such as NATO and AUKUS, members that fall behind =
in using AI to do things like share targeting data or operate in coordinate=
d formations risk creating seams in coalition operations that an enemy coul=
d exploit.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Finally, militarie=
s are eager to exploit commercial AI breakthroughs in image recognition, na=
vigation and automation. AI promises to shorten development cycles and cut =
costs, enabling rapid adaptation for combat use. Unlike past eras, when tec=
hnology like GPS began in military programs, today=E2=80=99s advances are l=
argely commercial, creating incentives to deploy before rigorous testing in=
 the chaos of combat.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Planned Us=
es</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Military AI progra=
ms are concentrating in three primary areas: missile defense, ISR fusion an=
d swarm coordination =E2=80=93 domains where speed is vital. These are also=
 the areas where competitive pressure makes the compressed-risk adoption mo=
del most visible.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Missile defense re=
mains the most prominent testing ground. AI can process radar and infrared =
inputs, distinguish between targets and make intercept decisions in millise=
conds =E2=80=93 which is essential for countering hypersonic glide vehicles=
 or massed ballistic launches. The U.S. is testing AI programs to integrate=
 its Aegis and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) systems across l=
ayered defenses, and China=E2=80=99s HQ-19 high-altitude interceptor likely=
 pursues similar automation for advanced missile threats. In both cases, op=
erational urgency is driving deployment before AI systems have proved their=
 reliability, particularly in degraded sensor environments.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">ISR fusion is the =
second major focus. By integrating satellite imagery, radar sweeps, signals=
 intelligence and battlefield sensors, AI can rapidly create a unified pict=
ure of the area of operation. NATO=E2=80=99s federated mission networking a=
nd the U.S. JADC2 program aim to accelerate targeting and shorten kill chai=
ns, while China is developing equivalent systems to give its forces a real-=
time shared operating picture in the Western Pacific. The complexity of the=
se networks makes them vulnerable to data corruption and spoofing, but thei=
r speed advantage ensures they will be used regardless.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A third priority i=
s swarm coordination, where AI manages large groups of unmanned vehicles =
=E2=80=93 dynamically retasking units, adapting formations and overwhelming=
 defenses without direct human involvement. The U.S.=E2=80=99 OFFSET (OFFen=
sive Swarm-Enabled Tactics) program, swarm demonstrations by the China Elec=
tronics Technology Group Corp. and reported Russian experiments in Ukraine =
all point to swarming as a near-term capability race. Here, too, deployment=
 is moving ahead even as militaries explore how to control escalation risks=
 when large autonomous formations are in play.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Other applications=
 are also advancing. Cyber-AI hybrids promise to detect and counter intrusi=
ons at machine speed, potentially shifting the balance between offense and =
defense in cyberwarfare. In logistics, countries are exploring predictive m=
aintenance and adaptive supply routing to sustain dispersed forces under pe=
rsistent attack. AI is also being adapted to attack rival systems, using cy=
ber, electronic warfare and data corruption to force misclassification or d=
isruption, and pushing each side to harden its own AI as fast as it builds =
it. In each case, competitive urgency, not perfected safeguards, is forcing=
 adoption.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Vulnerabil=
ities: Lessons From History</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The same competiti=
ve pressures that drive rapid AI adoption also magnify its vulnerabilities.=
 AI targeting and decision-making systems are only as reliable as the data =
they process =E2=80=93 bad data in means bad data out. In contested environ=
ments, adversaries can corrupt inputs through sensor spoofing (feeding fals=
e radar, infrared or GPS signals), data poisoning (manipulating training da=
ta or live feeds), cyber intrusion (altering targeting parameters) or envir=
onmental manipulation (using decoys, camouflage or electronic warfare). The=
se tactics can degrade performance or even cause friendly forces to be misc=
lassified as threats, turning AI=E2=80=99s speed into a liability.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Beyond technical w=
eaknesses, procedural gaps create additional hazards. Forces may adopt AI f=
aster than they adapt their rules of engagement or training, leading them t=
o place too much trust in AI during ambiguous situations. In politically te=
nse theaters, an autonomous misfire could escalate a crisis in seconds.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Material realities=
 also limit how far and fast AI can be deployed. High-performance processor=
s, secure communications networks and advanced sensors depend on supply lin=
es that can be disrupted or denied in combat. Supply chains are often globa=
l, fragile and outside direct military control, meaning that a well-timed i=
nterdiction, embargo or cyberattack on a single supplier can rapidly degrad=
e frontline AI performance. In high-tempo operations, even short interrupti=
ons can strip forces of critical capabilities, making supply chain security=
 an operational vulnerability as much as a logistical one.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Finally, even when=
 successfully fielded, AI will operate in contested environments. Counter-A=
I warfare =E2=80=93 blending electronic warfare, cyber operations and decep=
tion =E2=80=93 can corrupt targeting data or redirect assets, effectively t=
urning advanced capabilities against their operators. These vulnerabilities=
 reflect a broader pattern seen in earlier automation failures, where adver=
saries or environmental factors exploited system speed before safeguards co=
uld respond. The combination of early deployment and active contestation ma=
kes it plausible that an AI-driven error could trigger a crisis with little=
 warning =E2=80=93 an outcome that would test military restraint and allian=
ce cohesion under extreme time pressure.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">History shows that=
 the rush to field automation without fully accounting for its limits can c=
reate as many risks as advantages. In March 2003, during the Iraq War, a U.=
S. Patriot air defense battery wrongly classified a British Tornado returni=
ng to base as an incoming anti-radiation missile. With less than a minute t=
o react, the Patriot=E2=80=99s crew destroyed the aircraft, killing both pi=
lots. Though a human authorized the launch, the compressed engagement timel=
ine and automation-driven classification left little room for questioning t=
he result.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Past failures in o=
ther sectors, from civil aviation (the 737 MAX crashes) to financial tradin=
g (the 2010 =E2=80=9Cflash crash=E2=80=9D), show the same pattern: Once tru=
sted to act at high speed with minimal oversight, systems can fail faster t=
han humans can detect or correct them. In a military context, competitive p=
ressure means such vulnerabilities will not halt deployment; they will simp=
ly be managed in parallel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Strategic =
Implications</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The AI arms race i=
s not about perfecting machines =E2=80=93 it is about deploying them fast e=
nough to deny rivals a decisive advantage in speed or scale. This is the co=
mpressed-risk adoption model: integrating AI into high-tempo operations bef=
ore it is fully proven, collapsing the time between development, deployment=
 and combat exposure.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">History shows that=
 once a technology is trusted to act at high speed with minimal oversight, =
flaws and exploitation are inevitable. In today=E2=80=99s competitive envir=
onment, these vulnerabilities will not slow adoption but will be accepted a=
s the operational cost of keeping pace. Counter-AI warfare =E2=80=93 exploi=
ting AI=E2=80=99s dependence on clean, trustworthy data =E2=80=93 will emer=
ge as a formal discipline, with the potential to degrade capabilities in re=
al time and erode confidence in their use.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Deployment speed a=
nd resilience will decide who holds the advantage. Speed delivers early gai=
ns, but only those with secure supply chains, industrial depth and the abil=
ity to absorb losses can sustain capability under contestation. Nations tha=
t dominate the production of processors, secure communications and advanced=
 sensors will hold lasting leverage, able to deny rivals access, surge in c=
rises and dictate terms.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In a cycle where a=
doption drives countermeasures and countermeasures drive further adoption, =
the greater danger is falling behind =E2=80=93 not accepting early vulnerab=
ilities. The winners will be those who move fastest while maintaining contr=
ol.</p>
