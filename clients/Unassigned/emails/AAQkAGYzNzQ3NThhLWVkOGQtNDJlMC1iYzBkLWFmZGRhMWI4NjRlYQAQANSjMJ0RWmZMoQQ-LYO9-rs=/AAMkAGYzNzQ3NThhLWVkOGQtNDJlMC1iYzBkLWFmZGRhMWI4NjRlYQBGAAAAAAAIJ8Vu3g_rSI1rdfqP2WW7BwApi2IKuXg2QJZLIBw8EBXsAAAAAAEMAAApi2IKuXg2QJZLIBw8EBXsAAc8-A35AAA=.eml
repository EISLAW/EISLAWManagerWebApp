I want to make you a promise: at the end of this guide, you won=E2=80=99t b=
e confused by which model is which, and which model to pick for what task. =
You=E2=80=99ll actually know.
This is a bit of an unusual piece. I=E2=80=99ve received several requests f=
rom teachers for some material that will help in the classroom. Ages vary, =
so I have to think about ages roughly 10-99 when trying to tackle this.
Also, I=E2=80=99ve had a ton of requests from people who want to understand=
 which model they should pick. In fact =E2=80=9Cwhich model does this?=E2=
=80=9D is like one of my top questions I get via email, DM, carrier pigeon,=
 sonic spacehat vibe, etc.
And you know what, even though I=E2=80=99ve written about it=E2=80=94here [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/4091342e-7886-43e0-a95e-dcd9954c3c2e?j=3DeyJ=

N6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94the models keep=
 changing. That makes it hard for educators to keep up. It makes it hard fo=
r learners here on Substack to keep up. When I want to send someone a piece=
 I feel like I have to update it.
And everyone is left pulling out their hair because the model names are ter=
rible. Like ffs who decided o3 was smarter than 4o? What kind of parallel u=
niverse is this and where can I get a better one. And what are these models=
 good at? It should not take 10,000 words to explain.
Below is the vibe for model makers these days when they introduce yet anoth=
er model with a name I do not understand=E2=80=94and most people are more c=
onfused than me lol
So what=E2=80=99s a Nate to do? Give up? Not my jam. I stay with it until I=
 find a solution. And I think I have one now. It=E2=80=99s time to play car=
ds. Yep. I made actual printable model cards that look like playing cards (=
if that=E2=80=99s your thing), or maybe a touch tarot, or maybe a bit of a =
baseball card vibe. You get the concept.
I figured it was just easier with visuals. Each card has a single word that=
 expresses what that model is really good at, plus there=E2=80=99s a model =
card with it that gives you a brief summary of key model facts. And that=E2=
=80=99s not enough! I also grabbed tables of stuff to try for grownups and =
big kids, and gave you my own personal model stack too. Plus I wrote a spec=
ial introduction for folks new to AI that can be printed by teachers for ki=
ds and grownups.=20
Because why shouldn=E2=80=99t we have fun learning about models? Why can=E2=
=80=99t we play games?! We get to have fun around here.
And you know what=E2=80=99s fun? This is an extensible system. Sort of like=
 those geeky card games [ https://substack.com/redirect/5456add9-e02f-4585-=
a12d-c120ffed5e62?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4=
tAjMRMPOw0 ] some of us enjoy. So when a new model comes along, I can just =
create a new card for the deck and update you all! And then we can play the=
 game of adding cards to (and discarding card from) our personal stacks.=20
So which cards do we have? Well there are hundreds of AI models, so I had t=
o stop somewhere. But I do have a card for every single one of the top 15 m=
odels on the AI arena leaderboards [ https://substack.com/redirect/df295fa9=
-0a1a-4143-ada8-35324612cd8f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC=
7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. These include some models I don=E2=80=99t talk abo=
ut often, and I love that these cards are giving me a way to introduce some=
 of the more obscure top 15 in ways that are hopefully really easy to diges=
t.
So let=E2=80=99s play cards!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
Let=E2=80=99s lay out the cards shall we?
Teachers, below is a two-page introduction you can paste at the very top of=
 any slide deck, hand-out, or PDF. And if you=E2=80=99re new to AI, this al=
so works for you! This Page 1 handout answers the three questions beginners=
 always ask:
=E2=80=9CWhat exactly is an AI model?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhy are there so many of them?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CHow do I stay safe and get good answers?=E2=80=9D
Feel free to trim or re-order, but everything here fits on =C2=B1 one sheet=
 of paper and keeps jargon to a minimum.
Page 1 =E2=80=93 Welcome to Your Model Deck
1. What=E2=80=99s a =E2=80=9Cmodel=E2=80=9D in plain English?
Think of a large-language model (LLM) as a very smart autocomplete.
Feed it words, and it predicts what comes next=E2=80=94over and over=E2=80=
=94until a full answer appears. Each model is trained on different data, tu=
ned for different skills, and hosted by different companies.
2. Why do we have 16 cards?
No single model is best at everything=E2=80=94just like no single tool in a=
 toolbox can tighten every screw and cut every board.
Artificer excels at heavy reasoning; Scout is built for lightning-fast fact=
 checks. The deck lets you pick the right =E2=80=9Cspecialist=E2=80=9D for =
the job.
3. How to use a card
Identify your need (e.g., =E2=80=9CI must translate this email=E2=80=9D).
Find the matching card in the table.
Copy the starter prompt into the model=E2=80=99s chat box.
Run the next-level prompt if you want to dig deeper.
Answer the reflection question=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s where real learning h=
appens.
4. A minute on safety & etiquette
Rule of thumb: If you wouldn=E2=80=99t put the text on a public website, do=
n=E2=80=99t paste it into a free AI chat box.

Not sure what Scout and Diplomat mean yet? Stay tuned, you soon will!
=E2=80=9CIt didn=E2=80=99t work=E2=80=94now what?=E2=80=9D
Too short or generic? =E2=86=92 Add specifics: audience, style, length.
Factually weird? =E2=86=92 Ask, =E2=80=9CCite your sources=E2=80=9D or run =
Scout/Oracle for confirmation.
Stuck or repeating? =E2=86=92 Refresh the chat or break the task into small=
er pieces.
Where to find each model (free or demo)
Tip: Quotas reset daily=E2=80=94if the free site says you=E2=80=99re out of=
 messages, switch models or wait until tomorrow.
Ready?
Flip your first card, paste a prompt, and see what happens. Every model res=
ponds a little differently=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s the fun and the lesson.
Teachers, that=E2=80=99s it!
Put these two pages in front of the table and cards, and adult learners (or=

A cheatsheet to the cards=E2=80=A6
Use this table to refer to each of the cards you=E2=80=99ll see below. Each=
 one has its own uses and personality, as you=E2=80=99ll see!

How to use the table
Pick the need (=E2=80=9CI need quick translations=E2=80=9D).
Scan the =E2=80=98Ideal for=E2=80=A6=E2=80=99 column and choose that card/m=
odel.
Copy the Starter prompt into the model=E2=80=99s chat box.
Optionally run the Next-level prompt to push skills further.
Answer the Reflection question to cement learning.
Nate=E2=80=99s stack
Yep I have a personal model stack. And I=E2=80=99m sharing it here so you g=
et a sense of how a real model stack looks and works in the wild. Your job =
is to start to play with AI enough that you can pick your own personal stac=
k with confidence!
Finally, the cards!
Artificer=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82ChatGPT-o3
What it is. OpenAI=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Co3=E2=80=9D is the most reasoning-den=
se model available to the public. Think of it as a CNC mill for ideas: feed=
 it a fuzzy problem, and it iteratively carves out logic, equations, or cod=
e until the edges are sharp.
Why it made the deck. You rely on it as a daily driver for hard things=E2=
=80=94actuarial tables, SQL migrations, multi-stage prompt chains. Nothing =
else packs this much reliability into a single call.
When to play it. =E2=80=A2 Designing data schemas=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Debuggi=
ng opaque stack traces=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Writing memos where wrong math is =
reputationally fatal.
Watch-outs. Slower and pricier than mid-range models; best used when the ex=
tra IQ will be noticed.
Companion=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82ChatGPT-4o
What it is. The =E2=80=9Co=E2=80=9D stands for omni: text, voice, and visio=
n in one lightweight wrapper. It trades raw depth for latency and warmth.
Why included. It=E2=80=99s the friend who answers on the first ring=E2=80=
=94perfect for rapid notes, screen-share brainstorming, or photo-based quic=
k fixes.
Sweet spots. =E2=80=A2 Annotating screenshots=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Explaining =
a diagram by voice=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Tossing together a polite reply before=
 you board a plane.
Limitations. Doesn=E2=80=99t sweat edge cases; for rigorous analysis hand t=
he baton back to Artificer or Strategist.
Strategist=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82GPT-4.1
What it is. The flagship successor to GPT-4 Turbo. Same calm prose, sharper=
 long-range sense-making.
Why included. You keep reaching for it when the shape of a solution matters=
 more than the pixels=E2=80=94product road-maps, proposal trade-offs, scena=
rio planning.

=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Competitive-landscape memos.
Caveats. Costlier tokens than 4o; context still capped at 256 k, so ultra-l=
ong docs belong to Oracle.
Prodigy=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82GPT-4.5 preview
What it is. An early peek at OpenAI=E2=80=99s 4.5=E2=80=94smart, capable, e=

Shines at. =E2=80=A2 Complex refactors written like a consultant=E2=80=99s =
playbook=E2=80=82=E2=80=A2 Policy drafts that actually sound human.
Limits. Slightly narrower tool-calling APIs than OpenAI; can stall in long =
chats.
Composer=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82Claude 3.5 Sonnet
What it is. Anthropic=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cmiddle-weight=E2=80=9D model: smal=

ing executive summaries=E2=80=83=E2=80=A2 Rapid code patches with clean exp=

Watch-outs. Hard problems still belong to Opus or Artificer; token context =
tops out sooner than you want.
Oracle=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82Gemini 2.5 Pro / Ultra
What it is. Google=E2=80=99s flagship with million-token context and a stro=

panion for quick Q&A.
Prospector=E2=80=82=E2=80=94=E2=80=82DeepSeek R1
What it is. A Chinese-led open model that just cracked the top-10 in code b=

Quick classroom activity (10 minutes)
Pick a card. Each student chooses any one card that sounds fun.
Run the sample prompt. They copy the =E2=80=9Cbeginner task=E2=80=9D into t=
he real model (most have free or demo versions).
Share-back. In pairs, students read each other=E2=80=99s outputs and answer=
:
What did the model do well? What felt weird?
Sticky-note wall. Post takeaways under two headings: =E2=80=9CGreat for=E2=
=80=A6=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CCareful with=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D.
Closing =E2=80=93 Keep the Deck Alive
The deck you=E2=80=99re holding is designed to evolve. New models arrive, o=
ld favorites level-up, and entirely new use-cases appear almost weekly. Whe=
n the next models arrive, I=E2=80=99ll be making updates to the deck (or ho=
nestly you can make them yourself).=20
If you feel like a DIY card update:
Give it a one-word persona. Short, vivid, and true to the model=E2=80=99s e=
dge.
Write two test prompts. One beginner-friendly, one =E2=80=9Cstretch=E2=80=
=9D challenge.
Slip the new card into your pocket table. Note where it outshines=E2=80=94o=
r replaces=E2=80=94an older pick.
Share your findings. Pin them on the classroom wall, the team Slack, or the=
 community forum so everyone=E2=80=99s deck stays current.
Treat the collection like a living toolbox, not a finished set. The more yo=
u remix it, the sharper your AI intuition becomes=E2=80=94and the easier it=
 is for newcomers to jump in right behind you. Now go deal a fresh hand, an=
d let the next round of learning begin. I=E2=80=99ll be dropping new cards =
periodically as the AI continues to evolve!
