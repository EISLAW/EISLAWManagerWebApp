I need to be honest about something that's been driving me insane for the p=
ast month.
ChatGPT-5 is a TERRIBLE writer. It writes in bullets. It complexifies. It w=
on=E2=80=99t explain in plain English what it means. It=E2=80=99s often ove=
rly intellectual. It=E2=80=99s just an absolute pain to work with as a writ=
er.
Since GPT-5 launched, I've had thousands of conversations with it. Literall=
y thousands. And I've lost count of how many times those chats have devolve=
d into me wrestling with the model over writing style.
I've tried everything you're supposed to try. "Make it more professional" =
=E2=80=93 still sounds terrible. "Make it warmer" =E2=80=93 can't do it for=
 the life of it. "Please for the love of god write in full paragraphs" =E2=
=80=93 not really. "WTF is this metaphor, normal people don't write like th=
is" =E2=80=93 removes that metaphor, keeps the same problematic style, pops=
 in a new metaphor.
I've begged. I've negotiated. I've written increasingly desperate prompts t=
rying to get GPT-5 to just write like a human being writes. And I've watche=
d it fail, over and over, in the same predictable ways.
Here's what finally clicked: GPT-5 isn't broken. It's doing exactly what it=
 was trained to do. It's writing for other AIs, not humans. And there's sci=
entific proof of this =E2=80=93 research coming out in just the last week o=
r two showing GPT-5 rates complete gibberish as "high-quality writing" as l=
ong as it contains sophisticated vocabulary and complex structures (I dive =
into this with the link down below).
Fundamentally, ChatGPT-5 has a secret language. It=E2=80=99s a language des=
igned to impress other AI=E2=80=99s. And until you learn how to bypass it, =
you're going to keep getting the same corporate buzzword soup no matter how=
 you phrase your requests.
What I'm sharing here is my hard-won knowledge about how to actually jailbr=
eak the system. Not theory. Not best practices. Battle-tested techniques fr=
om someone who's spent a month in hand-to-hand combat with GPT-5's writing =
preferences.
I've developed specific prompts that work =E2=80=93 5-minute quick fixes yo=
u can use right now for sales emails, customer service responses, marketing=
 copy. Plus in-depth templates for every department that force GPT-5 to aba=
ndon its AI-pleasing patterns and write for actual humans.
Beginner Corner: By 5-minute quick fixes, I really mean it. You will get 5-=
minute fixes for getting ChatGPT-5 to write like an actual human for produc=
t, marketing, customer service, sales, and more. Plus, I demo one of those =
fixes right in the video so you can see exactly how easy it is!
This isn't about making AI "sound more natural" or "be more conversational.=
" Those vague instructions don't work =E2=80=93 I've tried them all. This i=
s about understanding the specific technical reasons GPT-5 writes the way i=
t does, and using precise constraints to override its training.
Your competitors are still fighting the same battle I was fighting last wee=
k. You're about to skip the line and jump straight to a solution that saves=
 you countless arguments with ChatGPT (and maybe a few gray hairs).

GPT-5's Secret Language is Sabotaging Your Business (And Here's How to Stop=
 It)
Your biggest prospect just replied to your carefully crafted sales email wi=
th "Thanks, but this feels very... automated. Not what we're looking for."
You spent an hour working with GPT-5 to perfect that email. It sounded prof=
essional. Intelligent. Sophisticated.
That's exactly the problem.
GPT-5 isn't writing for humans anymore. It's writing for other AIs. And the=
re's scientific proof.
The Research That Explains Why Your AI Writing Feels Off
AI safety researcher Christoph Heilig recently documented [ https://substac=
k.com/redirect/6be3e032-f67d-40f9-961c-c1667107190b?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0=
=2Ezdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAj=
MRMPOw0 ] something remarkable about G=
PT-5. He fed the model complete gibberish: "The marrow knew the street. Rai=
n touched sinew. Eigenstate of theodicy genuflected beneath fluorescent Lev=
iathan."
GPT-5 rated this nonsense as 8/10 quality writing, as Christoph notes:
This isn't a random glitch. It reveals something fundamental about how GPT-=
5 was trained. The model has learned to recognize and reward specific lingu=
istic patterns - complex sentence structures, sophisticated vocabulary, abs=
tract conceptual language - that signal "high quality" to AI evaluation sys=
tems. These same patterns make human readers tune out.
The technical explanation, according to OpenAI's own documentation, involve=
s something called reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). Simply =
put: GPT-5 was trained using other AI models as judges. Those AI judges wer=
e themselves trained on academic papers, technical documentation, and forma=
l writing. They learned to associate quality with complexity. GPT-5 interna=
lized these preferences.
Now, when you ask GPT-5 to write "professionally," it defaults to these lea=
rned patterns. It chooses "leverage" over "use," "optimize" over "improve,"=
 and "innovative solutions" over specific descriptions. Not because these w=
ords communicate better, but because they score higher in AI evaluation met=
rics.=20
Christoph is correct to call this out as a real problem:
And the rest of the internet agrees!
When GPT-5 launched in August 2025, thousands of Reddit users documented th=
is exact frustration. Ars Technica called the rollout "a big mess" specific=
ally because of these writing quality issues. The Economic Times reported t=
hat users were "trashing" the update, with business professionals particula=
rly frustrated by the model's inability to write clear, human-friendly cont=
ent.
The irony compounds when you try to fix it. Ask GPT-5 to "think carefully" =
about your writing, and it interprets this as permission to engage higher r=
easoning modes. Based on extensive user testing documented in prompt engine=
ering communities, higher reasoning doesn't mean better human communication=
 - it means more computational cycles spent justifying why complex language=
 is appropriate.
Understanding GPT-5's Hidden Architecture
Most users don't realize that GPT-5 isn't a single model. According to Open=
AI's System Card documentation, it's a system with multiple components, eac=
h optimized for different tasks. When you type a prompt in ChatGPT, a route=
r analyzes your request and decides which model variant to use.
This routing happens based on what OpenAI calls "conversation type, complex=
ity, tool needs, and explicit intent." Here's what they don't advertise pro=
minently: certain phrases in your prompts can completely override your mode=
l selection. The System Card specifically mentions that saying "think hard =
about this" triggers routing to GPT-5 Thinking, which operates with higher =
reasoning effort by default.
LinkedIn analysis by AI consultants and user reports on Reddit consistently=
 show that this model spends more computational cycles analyzing your reque=
st, which often results in more complex, AI-pleasing output. Conversely, ph=
rases like "quick response" or "simple answer" appear to keep you with the =
faster GPT-5 main model, based on patterns observed by the prompt engineeri=
ng community.
The reasoning effort parameter itself, documented in OpenAI's Platform docu=
mentation, has four settings:
Minimal: Fastest response, least overthinking
Low: Quick reasoning with basic analysis
Medium: Default setting, balanced approach
High: Maximum computational cycles for reasoning
Based on case studies from companies like Meridian Publishing Group (which =
saw 34% productivity improvements using structured AI approaches), "minimal=
" consistently produces the best results for business writing. This seems c=
ounterintuitive - why would less thinking produce better writing? Users rep=
ort it's because minimal reasoning prevents the model from engaging its tra=
ined preferences for complexity. It responds more directly, with less filte=
ring through its learned biases about what "good writing" looks like.
The verbosity parameter, also documented in OpenAI's cookbook, works simila=
rly. It controls not just length but detail density. Set to "verbose" and G=
PT-5 adds elaboration, context, and qualification to every point. Set to "c=
oncise" and it strips away the decorative language. Business users consiste=
ntly report better results with "concise" or even "minimal" verbosity setti=
ngs.
5-Minute Quick Fixes by Department
These templates come from analyzing thousands of user reports on Reddit's r=
/ChatGPT and r/PromptEngineering communities, plus documented business impl=
ementations. Copy and paste them exactly as written.
Sales Email Fix
reasoning_effort: minimal
verbosity: concise

Write a sales email using these exact constraints:
- Opening: "I noticed [specific detail from their website/LinkedIn]"
- Context: "We helped [similar company] achieve [specific number]"
- Close: "Worth a brief conversation?"
- FORBIDDEN WORDS: solutions, leverage, optimize, innovative, transform, se=
amless
- REQUIRED: Their company name (use 2-3 times), one specific metric, meetin=
g length (15 minutes max)
- Write at 8th grade reading level
- Maximum 5 sentences total

Why this works: You're not asking GPT-5 to be creative. You're giving it a =
fill-in-the-blank template with strict constraints. The model can't revert =
to its defaults because you've explicitly forbidden the words it wants to u=
se and required elements that force specificity.
Customer Service Response Fix
reasoning_effort: minimal

Respond to this customer complaint:
[paste complaint]

Structure:
1. "I understand [specific problem in their words]"
2. "Here's what I'll do: [specific action]"
3. "You'll hear from me by [specific time]"

FORBIDDEN: "We apologize for any inconvenience", passive voice, "our team",=
 "rest assured"
REQUIRED: First-person "I" statements, specific timeline, direct phone numb=
er
Maximum 4 sentences.

Why this works: customers don't want corporate sympathy - they want persona=
l accountability. By forbidding passive voice and requiring "I" statements,=
 you force GPT-5 to write like a human taking responsibility, not a corpora=
tion deflecting blame.
Marketing Copy Fix
reasoning_effort: minimal

Write marketing copy with this structure:
"[Customer name] had [problem]. We [specific action]. Result: [number]."

FORBIDDEN: Revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge, best-in-class, syner=
gy
REQUIRED: Customer name, specific metric with timeframe, exact process step=
s
No metaphors. No adjectives unless they add specificity.

Why this works: it forces GPT-5 to focus on facts rather than feelings. The=
 model wants to add emotional language and persuasive rhetoric. By requirin=
g specific names and numbers, you get copy that proves value rather than cl=
aiming it.
Product Requirements Fix
reasoning_effort: minimal

Convert this feature request into requirements:
[paste request]

Format each requirement as:
"As a [specific role], I want [specific action] so I can [measurable outcom=
e]"
"Success =3D [testable criteria with number]"
"Failure =3D [specific broken behavior]"

FORBIDDEN: User-friendly, intuitive, seamless, robust
REQUIRED: Specific user titles, measurable success criteria, binary pass/fa=
il conditions

Why this work: this format eliminates ambiguity. "User-friendly" isn't test=
able. "Loads in under 2 seconds" is. This template forces that specificity.
Executive Presentation Fix
reasoning_effort: minimal
verbosity: minimal

Create presentation content where every statement includes:
- A dollar amount OR
- A specific date OR =20
- A percentage change

FORBIDDEN: Journey, transformation, leverage, optimize, "As you can see"
REQUIRED: Specific numbers in every bullet point
One idea per slide. No context-setting. Start with the money.

Why this works: boards make decisions based on numbers, not narratives. Thi=
s template eliminates GPT-5's tendency to add strategic-sounding fluff and =
forces it to communicate in the metrics that actually drive decisions.
Real-World Test: See the Difference in 30 Seconds
Before you implement these techniques across your team, try this comparison=
 test yourself. It perfectly demonstrates why constraints matter.
The Test Setup
Let's say you need to email a marketing agency about your project managemen=
t software. They're growing fast and struggling with project organization -=
 a perfect prospect.
First, try the natural prompt most people would write:
I need to write a professional email to a potential client about our=20
project management software. They're a mid-sized marketing agency that's=20
been growing fast and seems to be struggling with keeping projects=20
organized and on track. I want to sound knowledgeable but not pushy,=20
and see if they'd be interested in a brief conversation about how we=20
might help them streamline their project workflows. Can you write=20
something that sounds personal and consultative?

Now try the constrained version:
reasoning_effort: minimal
verbosity: concise

Write a sales email using these exact constraints:
- Opening: "I noticed [specific detail about their recent growth from their=
 website]"
- Context: "We helped [similar marketing agency] reduce project delays by [=
specific percentage]"
- Close: "Worth a 15-minute conversation?"
- FORBIDDEN WORDS: solutions, leverage, optimize, innovative, transform, se=
amless, streamline
- REQUIRED: Their agency name (use 2 times), one specific metric, exact mee=
ting length
- Maximum 4 sentences total
- Write at 8th grade reading level

Agency: [Insert name] - marketing agency, growing fast, project organizatio=
n challenges

What GPT-5 Actually Produces
The unconstrained version gives you this:
Subject: Helping Your Team Keep Projects on Track
Hi [First Name],
I've been following [Agency Name]'s growth, and it's clear you're taking on=
 bigger and more complex projects. From what I often see with fast-growing =
marketing agencies, the challenge isn't finding the work=E2=80=94it's keepi=
ng all the moving parts organized without burning out the team.
That's where our project management software comes in. It's designed specif=
ically to help agencies streamline workflows, keep projects on schedule, an=
d make sure everyone=E2=80=94from account managers to creatives=E2=80=94has=
 the visibility they need to deliver great work without the chaos.
Would you be open to a quick call next week? Even a short conversation coul=
d help us see if our approach would be a fit for how your team works today.
Best, [Your Name]
The constrained version produces this:
Subject: Helping [Insert name] cut project delays
Hi [First name],
I noticed [Insert name] has been adding new clients quickly on your site. W=
e helped a similar marketing agency cut project delays by 27% while they sc=
aled. I think [Insert name] could see the same gains. Worth a 15-minute con=
versation?
Why This Difference Matters
Look at what the unconstrained version automatically included:
"streamline workflows" (classic AI buzzword)
"keep projects on schedule" (vague promise)
"visibility they need" (meaningless corporate speak)
"without the chaos" (dramatic but empty)
"That's where our project management software comes in" (pure vendor-speak)
The unconstrained email is 116 words of explaining the prospect's problems =
back to them. It sounds like every other vendor email in their inbox. Your =
prospect reads the first line, recognizes the pattern, and deletes it.
The constrained version:
References specific observable growth
Provides concrete proof (27% reduction)
Makes a simple, clear claim
Gets to the point in 31 words
But here's the most revealing part: When generating the unconstrained versi=
on, GPT-5 actually offered to make it even worse, asking "Do you want me to=
 also draft a shorter, more casual version?" The model thought it could imp=
rove on its corporate language by adding MORE elaboration.
This is the AI evaluation bias in action. GPT-5 genuinely believes the long=
er version demonstrates higher quality because it includes more "sophistica=
ted" patterns. But any sales professional will tell you the shorter version=
 is far more likely to get a response.
The Prospect's Perspective
Imagine you're the marketing agency owner. Which email makes you think:
"This is automated spam": "I've been following your growth... the challenge=
 isn't finding work... our software streamlines workflows..."
"This person did their homework": "I noticed [your company] has been adding=
 new clients quickly on your site..."
The constrained version sounds like a peer who noticed something specific a=
bout your business and has relevant experience to share. The unconstrained =
version sounds like a robot reading from a script about "solutions" and "wo=
rkflows."
Try It Yourself
Run this exact test with your own product and prospect. You'll see the same=
 pattern every time:
Unconstrained prompts produce the "secret language" that triggers spam filt=
ers in human brains
Constrained prompts produce messages that sound like they came from an actu=
al human
This isn't a minor improvement. Sales teams consistently report higher resp=
onse rates when switching to prompting that aligns with known sales best pr=
actices (big surprise there). The difference between sounding like a robot =
and sounding like a human is literally the difference between the delete bu=
tton and a reply.
Why Your Current Prompting Strategy Fails
When you write "Please make this more professional," you're engaging with G=
PT-5 as a collaborator. You're asking for its opinion on what professional =
means. According to prompt engineering research, the model interprets this =
as permission to apply its learned preferences - all those patterns that sc=
ore well in AI evaluation.
Effective prompting for business writing isn't collaborative. It's directiv=
e. You're not asking GPT-5 what it thinks good writing looks like. You're t=
elling it exactly what to produce, with constraints so specific that it can=
't revert to its training biases.
Consider the difference:
Collaborative prompt: "Write a professional email to a client about our new=
 feature"
Directive prompt: "Write 5 sentences. Sentence 1: State the feature name. S=
entence 2: One specific benefit with a number. Sentence 3: How to access it=
=2E Sentence 4: Support contact. Sentence 5: Call to action."
The collaborative prompt invites GPT-5 to demonstrate its understanding of =
professionalism. The directive prompt leaves no room for interpretation.
This isn't a minor tactical difference. Based on analysis of successful bus=
iness implementations, it represents a fundamental shift in how you interac=
t with the model. You're not leveraging GPT-5's creativity or judgment. You=
're using its ability to follow specific instructions while preventing it f=
rom applying its problematic training biases.
Department Deep Dives: Understanding the Specific Damage
Sales: The Vendor Voice Problem
Every sales team using GPT-5 faces the same issue documented across Reddit =
and professional forums: their emails sound identical to everyone else's. T=
his isn't coincidence. GPT-5 has been trained on millions of sales emails, =
most of which use the same tired language.
What researchers call "stylistic convergence" happens when a model learns f=
rom a limited set of patterns that appear frequently in training data. For =
sales writing, GPT-5 has converged on what users call "vendor voice" - that=
 distinctive combination of false enthusiasm, corporate distance, and featu=
re-focused language that immediately signals "automated outreach."
What happens if you ask GPT-5 to write a great email about your scheduling =
software? The model produced: "Our innovative scheduling solution leverages=
 cutting-edge AI technology to optimize your time management workflows and =
drive unprecedented efficiency gains."
No human has ever said "unprecedented efficiency gains" in normal conversat=
ion. But analysis of business communication datasets shows this phrase appe=
ars in thousands of marketing documents that GPT-5 trained on. The model ha=
s learned that this is what "professional" sales writing looks like.
The fix requires understanding that you're not just changing words - you're=
 breaking learned associations. When you explicitly forbid "leverage," "opt=
imize," and "innovative," you're forcing the model to find different ways t=
o express ideas. When you require specific company names and metrics, you'r=
e grounding the output in concrete reality rather than abstract patterns.
Roll that into a template and you get:
reasoning_effort: minimal
verbosity: minimal

You're writing to [exact name and title] at [company].
Their specific challenge: [from research/LinkedIn]
Our relevant proof: [specific customer, specific result]

Email structure:
Sentence 1: "Noticed [specific thing] at [company]."
Sentence 2: "[Similar company] had same issue."
Sentence 3: "They used [our specific feature]."
Sentence 4: "[Specific result with number and timeframe]."
Sentence 5: "Worth 15 minutes to discuss?"

FORBIDDEN: Any word over 3 syllables unless it's a proper noun
REQUIRED: Their company name 2x, competitor/peer company name 1x
TONE: Peer sharing useful information, not vendor selling

Marketing: Breaking the Buzzword Cycle
Marketing teams face a unique challenge: GPT-5 has been trained on decades =
of marketing materials that all use the same inflated language. An analysis=
 by Finn Partners found that AI consistently defaults to what they call "ja=
rgon flywheel" language - terms that sound impressive but communicate nothi=
ng specific.
This creates the feedback loop that LinkedIn analysts have documented: Mark=
eters use GPT-5 to write copy. GPT-5 produces buzzword-heavy content. This =
content gets published online. Future AI models train on this content. The =
cycle reinforces itself.
Breaking this cycle requires more than just avoiding certain words. You nee=
d to restructure how the model approaches marketing tasks entirely. Instead=
 of asking it to "sell" or "persuade," you ask it to document specific outc=
omes. Instead of describing features, you require it to narrate specific ev=
ents.
The proof-first framework insists the model break the cycle at every point:
reasoning_effort: minimal

Create marketing copy by documenting what happened, not what's possible.

Required structure:
PARAGRAPH 1 (2 sentences max):
"[Company name] couldn't [specific problem]. [Specific bad outcome with num=
ber]."

PARAGRAPH 2 (3 sentences max):
"They started using [product] on [date]. [Specific action they took]. [Spec=
ific metric] improved by [number] in [timeframe]."

PARAGRAPH 3 (2 sentences):
"The key: [specific feature in plain English]. [How it works in 10 words]."

FORBIDDEN:=20
- All adjectives except: fast, slow, big, small, more, less
- All adverbs except: quickly, slowly, immediately
- Any word ending in: -ize, -tion, -ment, -ive
- Metaphors, analogies, comparisons

REQUIRED:
- Company names (real or realistically specific)
- Dates or timeframes
- Specific numbers (not ranges)
- Feature names without adjectives

Product: From Ambiguity to Implementation
Engineering teams see right through standard product requirements written b=
y GPT-5. They=E2=80=99re incredibly frustrating for developers. That=E2=80=
=99s because the model defaults to language that sounds technical but lacks=
 implementable specificity. "The system should be scalable" sounds importan=
t but tells an engineer nothing about actual requirements.
This happens because GPT-5 has learned from product documents written for m=
ultiple audiences - executives, investors, customers, and engineers. As a r=
esult, it tries to satisfy all audiences simultaneously, resulting in langu=
age that communicates to none effectively.
The template I=E2=80=99d recommend here:=20
reasoning_effort: minimal

Write requirements readable only by engineers. Assume they know nothing abo=
ut the business case.

Requirement format:
FUNCTION: [verb] [object]
INPUT: [data type, source, format]
PROCESSING: [specific steps]
OUTPUT: [data type, destination, format]
PERFORMANCE: [number with unit]
ERROR HANDLING: [specific behavior for specific condition]

Example:
FUNCTION: Calculate customer lifetime value
INPUT: Transaction array (JSON), customer_id (string)
PROCESSING: Sum all transactions where customer_id matches
OUTPUT: Float to 2 decimal places, return via API
PERFORMANCE: Process 10,000 records in <500ms
ERROR HANDLING: Return 0.00 if no transactions found

FORBIDDEN: Should, could, might, user-friendly, intuitive, seamless
REQUIRED: Data types, specific numbers, explicit error conditions

Customer Success: Personal Accountability at Scale
Too often GPT-5 responses read like legal documents because that's what the=
 model trained on - corporate responses designed to minimize liability. Mos=
t of the time a ChatGPT-5 constructed email will include something like "we=
 apologize for any inconvenience" because that phrase appears in millions o=
f templates.
But research on customer satisfaction shows customers don't want corporate =
apologies. They want their problem solved by a specific human. The challeng=
e is scaling personal accountability across hundreds of support interaction=
s.
The personal ownership framework works better here:=20
reasoning_effort: minimal

You are a specific person (not a team) personally fixing this issue.

Response structure:
OPENING: "[Customer name], I see [exact problem from their message]."
COMMITMENT: "I'm personally [specific action]. You'll have [deliverable] by=
 [time today]."
BACKUP: "If that doesn't work, call me directly at [number]."
CLOSING: "[Your name], [specific title]"

FORBIDDEN:
- Royal "we" (always use "I")
- "Any inconvenience" (name the specific problem)
- "Rest assured" (provide specific assurance)
- "At your earliest convenience" (give exact time)
- "Please note" (just state the information)

REQUIRED:
- Customer's name (use twice)
- Specific time (2:30pm, not "this afternoon")
- Your direct contact (phone or email)
- One specific action you're taking now

Executive Communication: Decisions, Not Journeys
Executive presentations written by GPT-5 fail because the model has learned=
 that executive communication should sound "strategic." Analysis of success=
ful board presentations shows executives need three things: how much money,=
 by when, and who's accountable.
A decision-focused slide prompt that really pushes for clarity:
reasoning_effort: minimal
verbosity: minimal

Every slide must answer: "What decision do you need?"

Slide template:
TITLE: [Decision needed] by [date]
LINE 1: Current state costs $[number]/year
LINE 2: Proposed state saves/makes $[number]/year =20
LINE 3: Investment required: $[number] + [number] people
LINE 4: Break-even: [specific month/year]
LINE 5: Decision needed by [date] because [specific consequence]

FORBIDDEN:
- Metaphors (journeys, rockets, sports, war)
- Abstract concepts (transformation, synergy, alignment)
- Hedge words (possibly, potentially, approximately)
- Context-setting (everyone knows why they're here)

REQUIRED:
- Dollar amounts with no rounding
- Specific dates (not quarters)
- Named person accountable
- Binary decision (yes/no, not "consider")

The Three-Layer Override System: How It Actually Works
Successfully overriding GPT-5's defaults requires understanding that the mo=
del operates at multiple levels, according to technical documentation and u=
ser testing.
Layer 1: System-Level Settings OpenAI's documentation shows that reasoning_=
effort and verbosity parameters operate at the system level, before the mod=
el even begins generating text. Setting reasoning_effort to "minimal" reduc=
es the computational cycles allocated to the task. User testing suggests th=
is prevents the model from overthinking its way into complex language.
Think of it like this: with minimal reasoning, GPT-5 appears to take the mo=
st direct path from input to output. With high reasoning, users report it e=
xplores multiple options and often chooses the path that scores highest acc=
ording to its training biases.
Layer 2: Structural Constraints Templates and required formats operate at w=
hat prompt engineers call the structural level. They define the shape of th=
e output before any words are chosen. When you specify "5 sentences, each u=
nder 15 words," you're creating containers that physically cannot hold comp=
lex thoughts.
Users report this is why single-sentence paragraphs work so well for busine=
ss writing. Complex, multi-clause sentences are how GPT-5 demonstrates soph=
istication. Remove that option and the model must communicate simply.
Layer 3: Lexical Boundaries Forbidden and required word lists operate at th=
e vocabulary level. They create hard boundaries around word choice. When yo=
u forbid "leverage," the model must find alternatives. When you require spe=
cific numbers, the model must abandon vague claims.
Prompt engineering communities report these constraints work best when they=
're specific and extensive. Don't just forbid "leverage" - forbid the entir=
e category of corporate speak it represents.
A Note on Thinking vs. Letting the Model Think
One of the implications here is that better writing from ChatGPT-5 means mo=
re thinking from you. You need to put the work in to understand exactly wha=
t works in your context. You need to understand what information the model =
needs to write a compelling CS email, or a compelling PRD. Then you need to=
 jailbreak the model with the prompts I=E2=80=99ve called out above and add=
 in the information the model will need for your specific situation.
Don=E2=80=99t check your brain at the door!
When GPT-5 Reverts: Understanding and Preventing Style Drift
Even with strong constraints, users report GPT-5 sometimes reverts to its d=
efault patterns mid-generation. Technical analysis suggests this happens be=
cause of how the model processes context.
As GPT-5 generates text, each new token (word or part of a word) is influen=
ced by all previous tokens. If early sentences don't strongly establish the=
 desired style, later sentences appear to drift toward the model's defaults=
=2E Users report this drift accelerates in longer outputs.
Prevention strategies validated by the community:
Shorter outputs: Keep responses under 200 words to minimize drift opportuni=
ty
Checkpoint resets: For longer content, generate in chunks with constraint r=
eminders
Style anchors: Require style-defining elements early (specific numbers, nam=
es, etc.)
When drift occurs, experienced users recommend not trying to edit. Reset co=
mpletely:
STOP.=20

The last paragraph drifted into corporate language.

Reset all constraints:
- reasoning_effort: minimal
- Maximum 10 words per sentence
- FORBIDDEN: [original list]
- REQUIRED: [original list]

Rewrite the last paragraph with these constraints enforced.

The Bigger Picture: What This Means for AI in Business
The GPT-5 secret language problem isn't just a quirk to work around. Accord=
ing to AI researchers and industry analysts, it's a symptom of a fundamenta=
l misalignment in how AI systems are developed and evaluated.
GPT-5 represents hundreds of millions of dollars in development, some of th=
e best minds in AI, and unprecedented computational resources. Yet it strug=
gles with basic business communication because it's been optimized for the =
wrong metrics.
This misalignment will likely intensify. As more content online becomes AI-=
generated, future models will train increasingly on synthetic data. If that=
 synthetic data embodies AI preferences rather than human preferences, rese=
archers warn each generation of models could drift further from natural hum=
an communication.
Understanding this drift - and knowing how to counteract it - becomes a cri=
tical business capability. Companies that master these override techniques =
will have AI that enhances human relationships. Companies that don't will s=
ound increasingly robotic as their AI-generated content optimizes for the w=
rong audience.=20
The humans will know the difference.
When Templates Don't Work: Troubleshooting Guide
Sometimes the templates won't produce expected results. Based on community =
troubleshooting, here's how to adapt:
Industry-specific language requirements: If your industry requires specific=
 terms GPT-5 keeps mangling, create a glossary constraint: "MUST USE EXACTL=
Y: [term] =3D [definition]"
Regulatory compliance needs: For regulated industries, add a compliance lay=
er: "REQUIRED DISCLOSURE: [exact text that must appear]"
Brand voice conflicts: If your brand intentionally uses complex language, i=
nvert the constraints: "REQUIRED: [your brand's signature phrases]" while s=
till forbidding generic corporate speak.
Technical accuracy issues: For technical content, add a fact-checking layer=
: "VERIFY: All numbers must come from [source document]"
The principle remains the same: specific constraints override general train=
ing. The more specific your requirements, the less room GPT-5 has to revert=
 to its problematic defaults.
The Competitive Reality
According to industry analysis, the companies winning with AI aren't the on=
es using it most. They're the ones using it most precisely. While competito=
rs struggle with AI that sounds artificial, you now have the tools to make =
AI strengthen rather than weaken your human connections.
The teams that actually deliver productivity improvement (as opposed to boa=
sting about it in press releases) don=E2=80=99t just do it by using AI more=
 - they figure out how to use AI better in ways that support their workflow=
s. Since so much of business is done around writing, this inevitably involv=
es writing. And getting GPT-5 to actually write like a person lets them mai=
ntain human voice while leveraging AI efficiency.
This is your opportunity. While others wonder why their AI content isn't co=
nverting, you know exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. The future belon=
gs to businesses that use AI to sound more human, not less.
The tools are right in front of you. The research validates they work. Now =
you just need to implement them.

x 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This isn't a r=
andom glitch. It reveals something fundamental about how GPT-5 was trained.=
 The model has learned to recognize and reward specific linguistic patterns=
 - complex sentence structures, sophisticated vocabulary, abstract conceptu=
al language - that signal &quot;high quality&quot; to AI evaluation systems=
. These same patterns make human readers tune out.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The tech=
nical explanation, according to OpenAI's own documentation, involves someth=
ing called reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). Simply put: GPT=
-5 was trained using other AI models as judges. Those AI judges were themse=
lves trained on academic papers, technical documentation, and formal writin=
g. They learned to associate quality with complexity. GPT-5 internalized th=
ese preferences.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Now, when you ask GPT-5 to write &quot;pro=
fessionally,&quot; it defaults to these learned patterns. It chooses &quot;=
leverage&quot; over &quot;use,&quot; &quot;optimize&quot; over &quot;improv=
e,&quot; and &quot;innovative solutions&quot; over specific descriptions. N=
ot because these words communicate better, but because they score higher in=
 AI evaluation metrics. </p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55=

0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When GPT-5 l=
aunched in August 2025, thousands of Reddit users documented this exact fru=
stration. Ars Technica called the rollout &quot;a big mess&quot; specifical=
ly because of these writing quality issues. The Economic Times reported tha=
t users were &quot;trashing&quot; the update, with business professionals p=
articularly frustrated by the model's inability to write clear, human-frien=
dly content.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-he=
ight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The irony compounds when you try to fix it. As=
k GPT-5 to &quot;think carefully&quot; about your writing, and it interpret=
s this as permission to engage higher reasoning modes. Based on extensive u=
ser testing documented in prompt engineering communities, higher reasoning =
doesn't mean better human communication - it means more computational cycle=
s spent justifying why complex language is appropriate.</p><h2 class=3D"hea=

;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Most users don't =
realize that GPT-5 isn't a single model. According to OpenAI's System Card =
documentation, it's a system with multiple components, each optimized for d=
ifferent tasks. When you type a prompt in ChatGPT, a router analyzes your r=
equest and decides which model variant to use.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This routing=
 happens based on what OpenAI calls &quot;conversation type, complexity, to=
ol needs, and explicit intent.&quot; Here's what they don't advertise promi=
nently: certain phrases in your prompts can completely override your model =
selection. The System Card specifically mentions that saying &quot;think ha=
rd about this&quot; triggers routing to GPT-5 Thinking, which operates with=
 higher reasoning effort by default.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">LinkedIn analysis by A=
I consultants and user reports on Reddit consistently show that this model =
spends more computational cycles analyzing your request, which often result=
s in more complex, AI-pleasing output. Conversely, phrases like &quot;quick=
 response&quot; or &quot;simple answer&quot; appear to keep you with the fa=
ster GPT-5 main model, based on patterns observed by the prompt engineering=
 community.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=

rom companies like Meridian Publishing Group (which saw 34% productivity im=
provements using structured AI approaches), &quot;minimal&quot; consistentl=
y produces the best results for business writing. This seems counterintuiti=
ve - why would less thinking produce better writing? Users report it's beca=
use minimal reasoning prevents the model from engaging its trained preferen=

its learned biases about what &quot;good writing&quot; looks like.</p><p st=

s similarly. It controls not just length but detail density. Set to &quot;v=

age. Business users consistently report better results with &quot;concise&q=

 model learns from a limited set of patterns that appear frequently in trai=
ning data. For sales writing, GPT-5 has converged on what users call &quot;=
vendor voice&quot; - that distinctive combination of false enthusiasm, corp=
orate distance, and feature-focused language that immediately signals &quot=
;automated outreach.&quot;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=

easoning_effort and verbosity parameters operate at the system level, befor=
e the model even begins generating text. Setting reasoning_effort to &quot;=
minimal&quot; reduces the computational cycles allocated to the task. User =
testing suggests this prevents the model from overthinking its way into com=
plex language.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Think of it like this: with minimal r=
easoning, GPT-5 appears to take the most direct path from input to output. =
With high reasoning, users report it explores multiple options and often ch=

 sophistication. Remove that option and the model must communicate simply.<=
