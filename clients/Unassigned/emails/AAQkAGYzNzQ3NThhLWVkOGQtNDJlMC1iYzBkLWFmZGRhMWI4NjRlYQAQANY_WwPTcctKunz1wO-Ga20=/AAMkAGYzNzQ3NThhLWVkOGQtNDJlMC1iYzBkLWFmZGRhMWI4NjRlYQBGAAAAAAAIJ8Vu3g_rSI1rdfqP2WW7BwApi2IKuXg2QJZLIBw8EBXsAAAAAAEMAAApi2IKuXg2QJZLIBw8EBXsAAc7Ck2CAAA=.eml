Welcome, Watcher! This week, we're exploring three research highlights that=
 reimagine how AI systems evolve, learn, and scale - moving us away from ri=
gid, pre-engineered solutions toward more adaptive, self-improving intellig=
ence.
First up, Alita challenges the entire paradigm of AI agent design. Rather t=
han pre-loading agents with countless specialized tools like a bloated Swis=
s Army knife, Alita starts with just a web agent and teaches itself to crea=
te new tools on demand. This minimalist approach not only achieved #1 ranki=
ng on the GAIA benchmark but also generated reusable tools that tripled the=
 performance of smaller models - proving that simplicity paired with self-e=
volution beats complexity.
Next, rStar-Coder tackles the data scarcity problem in competitive programm=
ing head-on. Through a clever mutual verification mechanism where multiple =
solutions cross-check each other, they synthesized high-quality training da=
ta that enabled a 7B model to outperform its own 32B teacher. This shows th=
at smart data generation can be more powerful than simply scaling model siz=
e, democratizing access to state-of-the-art code reasoning.
Finally, QwenLong-L1 extends the reasoning revolution to long contexts - up=
 to 120K tokens. Using progressive context scaling and curriculum-guided re=
inforcement learning, they created models that can maintain deep reasoning =
capabilities while processing entire books or research papers, matching the=
 performance of Claude-3.5-Sonnet-Thinking and opening doors to AI systems =
that can truly engage with information-intensive real-world tasks.
The underlying trend: We're witnessing a shift from manual engineering to s=
elf-organizing intelligence. Whether it's agents building their own tools, =
models generating their own training data, or systems learning to handle pr=
ogressively complex contexts, the future belongs to AI that evolves and imp=
roves itself.=20

1. Alita: Generalist Agent Enabling Scalable Agentic Reasoning with Minimal=
 Predefinition and Maximal Self-Evolution
Watching: Alita (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/20484b04-9ff7-48f7-8=
7ae-06fe24d19790?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=

jMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Most AI agents today are like Swiss Army knives=
 - they come pre-loaded with dozens of specialized tools and carefully desi=
gned workflows for different tasks. While this sounds great in theory, it c=
reates a fundamental bottleneck: developers can't possibly anticipate and p=
re-build every tool an agent might need in the real world. This manual engi=
neering approach severely limits how well these agents can adapt to new sit=
uations, scale to different domains, or creatively solve problems they were=
n't explicitly programmed for. Think of it like trying to pack for every po=
ssible scenario on a world trip - you'd need an impossibly large suitcase.
How does it solve the problem? The researchers took a radically different a=
pproach with Alita, following Leonardo da Vinci's principle that "simplicit=
y is the ultimate sophistication." Instead of pre-loading the agent with co=
untless tools, they gave it just one core capability (a web agent) and taug=
ht it to build its own tools on the fly. Alita uses Model Context Protocols=
 (MCPs) - think of these as standardized blueprints that help the agent cre=
ate, package, and reuse new capabilities as needed. When faced with a task,=
 Alita searches for relevant open-source code, generates appropriate tools,=
 tests them in isolated environments, and saves successful ones for future =
use. It's like teaching someone to fish rather than giving them a freezer f=
ull of pre-caught fish.
What are the key findings? Despite having minimal built-in tools, Alita ach=
ieved remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks. On the challenging=
 GAIA benchmark, it scored 75.15% on first attempt and 87.27% within three =
attempts, ranking #1 among all general-purpose agents tested. It also perfo=
rmed impressively on specialized tasks: 74% accuracy on MathVista (visual m=
ath problems) and 52% on PathVQA (medical visual questions). Perhaps most i=
ntriguingly, the tools Alita creates can be reused by other agents - when s=
maller, less capable models used Alita's generated tools, their performance=
 improved dramatically, with Level 3 (hardest) problems showing a 3x improv=
ement from 3.85% to 11.54% accuracy.
Why does it matter? Their results fundamentally challenge how we think abou=
t building AI agents. Rather than the current paradigm of ever-increasing c=
omplexity and manual engineering, Alita proves that giving agents the abili=
ty to evolve and create their own tools leads to better performance and ada=
ptability. This has massive implications for the future of AI development -=
 instead of armies of engineers hand-crafting tools for every possible scen=
ario, we can build simpler systems that grow their own capabilities. It's a=
lso a form of knowledge distillation: powerful models can generate tools th=
at help weaker models perform better, democratizing access to advanced AI c=
apabilities without requiring everyone to run expensive, large models.

2. rStar-Coder: Scaling Competitive Code Reasoning with a Large-Scale Verif=
ied Dataset

tAjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? Teaching AI to solve complex programming proble=
ms is like trying to train a pianist without access to challenging sheet mu=
sic. While Large Language Models have shown promise in code generation, the=
ir ability to tackle competition-level programming problems - the kind that=
 require deep algorithmic thinking and efficient implementations - is sever=
ely hampered by a critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality trainin=
g data. Unlike math problems where you can verify answers with simple rule-=
based matching, code solutions need to be executed against diverse test cas=
es that catch logical errors, edge cases, and efficiency issues. Think of i=
t like the difference between checking if 2+2=3D4 versus ensuring a sorting=
 algorithm works correctly for arrays of different sizes, with duplicates, =
empty arrays, and millions of elements.
How does it solve the problem? rStar-Coder eses a clever three-pronged appr=
oach. First, the researchers collected 37.7K expert-written competitive pro=
gramming problems as seeds and used them to synthesize new, solvable proble=
ms - but instead of just asking an LLM to create variations, they included =
the original solution to help the model understand the core algorithmic con=
cepts being tested. Second, they tackled the test case generation challenge=
 by breaking it into manageable pieces: they prompted GPT-4o to create util=
ity functions that generate valid inputs of varying complexity (from 100 to=
 10^5 elements) and validate them against problem constraints. Third, they =
introduced a "mutual verification" mechanism - they generated multiple solu=
tions using a strong reasoning model (QWQ-32B) and only accepted test cases=
 where the majority of solutions agreed on the outputs. It's like having mu=
ltiple experts solve a problem independently; if they all arrive at the sam=
e answer, you can be confident it's correct.
What are the key findings? rStar-Coder dramatically improved code reasoning=
 capabilities, with the Qwen2.5-7B model jumping from 17.4% to 57.3% on Liv=
eCodeBench, and the 14B version reaching 62.5%, actually beating OpenAI's o=
3-mini by 3.1%. On the notoriously difficult USA Computing Olympiad benchma=
rk, their 7B model achieved 16.15% accuracy, outperforming the much larger =
QWQ-32B model - particularly impressive since QWQ-32B was the very model us=
ed to generate their training solutions. The approach also proved that qual=
ity trumps quantity: despite using fewer examples (580K) than competitors l=
ike OCR (736K) and OpenThinker2 (1M), rStar-Coder consistently outperformed=
 them. Even more surprisingly, models trained on this competition-focused d=
ataset generalized remarkably well to standard code generation tasks, with =
the 7B model matching Claude 3.5 Sonnet's performance on benchmarks like Hu=
manEval.
Why does it matter? These results have the potential to shift the paradigm =
for training code reasoning models. Rather than the endless arms race of cr=
eating ever-larger models or manually crafting millions of examples, rStar-=
Coder proves that a well-designed data generation pipeline can enable small=
er models to punch far above their weight class. The mutual verification me=
chanism is particularly clever - it essentially bootstraps reliability from=
 uncertainty, creating a virtuous cycle where models can verify their own s=
ynthetic data. This has massive practical implications: organizations witho=
ut access to frontier-scale compute can now train highly capable code reaso=
ning models, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. Perhaps most=
 intriguingly, the fact that a 7B model can outperform the 32B teacher mode=
l that helped create its training data suggests we're only scratching the s=
urface of what's possible with intelligent data synthesis and verification.
3. QwenLong-L1: Towards Long-Context Large Reasoning Models with Reinforcem=
ent Learning
Watching: QwenLong-L1 (paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/a434d745-9b9b-=

AjMRMPOw0 ])
What problem does it solve? While recent large reasoning models (LRMs) like=
 OpenAI's o1 have shown impressive reasoning capabilities through reinforce=
ment learning, these improvements have been limited to short-context tasks =
(around 4K tokens). The challenge is that extending these models to handle =
long-context inputs (120K+ tokens) while maintaining robust reasoning capab=
ilities remains unsolved. This is particularly problematic for real-world a=
pplications that require processing extensive documents, conducting deep re=
search, or working with information-intensive environments where models nee=
d to both retrieve relevant information from long contexts and perform mult=
i-step reasoning.
How does it solve the problem? QwenLong-L1 is a progressive context scaling=
 framework that systematically adapts short-context reasoning models to lon=
g-context scenarios. Their approach includes three key components: first, a=
 warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust initial p=
olicy; second, a curriculum-guided phased RL technique that gradually incre=
ases context length across training phases to stabilize optimization; and t=
hird, a difficulty-aware retrospective sampling strategy that prioritizes c=
hallenging examples to encourage policy exploration. They also implemented =
hybrid reward mechanisms combining rule-based verification with LLM-as-a-ju=
dge evaluation to balance precision and recall.
What are the key findings? QwenLong-L1 achieved leading performance across =
seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks, with the 32B mod=
el outperforming flagship models like OpenAI-o3-mini and Qwen3-235B-A22B, e=
ven matching Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking's performance. The research reveale=
d that progressive context scaling enables higher entropy and stabilizes KL=
 divergence during training, while RL naturally fosters specialized long-co=
ntext reasoning behaviors like grounding, subgoal setting, backtracking, an=
d verification that boost final performance.
Why does it matter? This is making LRMs practically useful for real-world a=
pplications requiring extensive context processing. The work provides the f=
irst systematic framework for long-context reasoning RL, addressing critica=
l challenges in training efficiency and optimization stability. This advanc=
ement opens doors for AI systems capable of conducting automated scientific=
 research, analyzing long videos, and handling complex information-intensiv=
e tasks that require both contextual grounding and sophisticated reasoning =
across vast amounts of information.

Grammars of Formal Uncertainty: When to Trust LLMs in Automated Reasoning T=

LLMs automate reasoning via formal specifications, but probabilistic output=
s clash with formal verification. Analyzing failure modes and UQ, the paper=
 shows SMT's domain-specific impact; token probability entropy fails as a U=
Q method. A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) framework reveals tas=
k-dependent uncertainty. Fusing signals enables selective verification, red=
ucing errors with minimal abstention, creating reliable LLM formalization.

The multi-agent THiNK framework, grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy, evaluates LL=
M higher-order thinking via iterative problem generation and reflection. LL=
Ms perform well in lower-order categories but struggle applying knowledge i=
n realistic contexts and exhibit abstraction limitations. Feedback enhances=
 reasoning, aligning outputs with domain logic and problem structure. THiNK=
 offers a scalable evaluation method for probing and enhancing LLM reasonin=
g, grounded in learning science. Code is on GitHub.

Enhancing LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks requires costly reinforcement =
learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using=
 chain-of-thought (CoT). This paper explores incentivizing LLM reasoning th=
rough weaker supervision. Weak reasoners improve performance, achieving 94%=
 of RL gains across diverse benchmarks and model architectures. The weak-to=
-strong paradigm offers a cost-effective alternative for incentivizing stro=

LLMs need temporal reasoning and planning. The Temporal Constraint-based Pl=
anning (TCP) benchmark jointly assesses these skills using dialogues about =
a collaborative project, requiring an optimal schedule under temporal const=
raints. TCP uses problem prototypes paired with realistic scenarios; a huma=
n quality check is performed. Analysis of failure cases reveals limitations=
 in LLMs' planning abilities.
Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM Reas=

When Large Language Models backtrack and correct themselves mid-reasoning, =
conventional wisdom suggests they're being inefficient. Bayes-Adaptive RL (=
BARL) reframes the problem using Bayes-Adaptive RL, which treats each reaso=
ning path as a hypothesis about the correct approach. The model maintains u=
ncertainty over which strategy will work and uses feedback to eliminate inc=
orrect hypotheses.

An online self-training reinforcement learning algorithm scales LLMs withou=

This minimalist approach not only achieved #1 ranking on the GAIA benchmark=

Through a clever mutual verification mechanism where multiple solutions cro=

 generation can be more powerful than simply scaling model size, democratiz=

b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What problem does i=
t solve?</strong><span> Most AI agents today are like Swiss Army knives - t=
hey come pre-loaded with dozens of specialized tools and carefully designed=
 workflows for different tasks. While this sounds great in theory, it creat=
es a fundamental bottleneck: developers can't possibly anticipate and pre-b=
uild every tool an agent might need in the real world. This manual engineer=
ing approach severely limits how well these agents can adapt to new situati=
ons, scale to different domains, or creatively solve problems they weren't =
explicitly programmed for. Think of it like trying to pack for every possib=
le scenario on a world trip - you'd need an impossibly large suitcase.</spa=
n></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the problem?</strong><span> Th=
e researchers took a radically different approach with Alita, following Leo=
nardo da Vinci's principle that &quot;simplicity is the ultimate sophistica=
tion.&quot; Instead of pre-loading the agent with countless tools, they gav=
e it just one core capability (a web agent) and taught it to build its own =
tools on the fly. Alita uses Model Context Protocols (MCPs) - think of thes=
e as standardized blueprints that help the agent create, package, and reuse=
 new capabilities as needed. When faced with a task, Alita searches for rel=
evant open-source code, generates appropriate tools, tests them in isolated=
 environments, and saves successful ones for future use. It's like teaching=
 someone to fish rather than giving them a freezer full of pre-caught fish.=
</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>What are the key findings? </strong><span>D=
espite having minimal built-in tools, Alita achieved remarkable performance=
 across multiple benchmarks. On the challenging GAIA benchmark, it scored 7=
5.15% on first attempt and 87.27% within three attempts, ranking #1 among a=
ll general-purpose agents tested. It also performed impressively on special=
ized tasks: 74% accuracy on MathVista (visual math problems) and 52% on Pat=
hVQA (medical visual questions). Perhaps most intriguingly, the tools Alita=
 creates can be reused by other agents - when smaller, less capable models =
used Alita's generated tools, their performance improved dramatically, with=
 Level 3 (hardest) problems showing a 3x improvement from 3.85% to 11.54% a=
ccuracy.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matter? </strong><span>=
Their results fundamentally challenge how we think about building AI agents=
. Rather than the current paradigm of ever-increasing complexity and manual=
 engineering, Alita proves that giving agents the ability to evolve and cre=
ate their own tools leads to better performance and adaptability. This has =
massive implications for the future of AI development - instead of armies o=
f engineers hand-crafting tools for every possible scenario, we can build s=
impler systems that grow their own capabilities. It's also a form of knowle=
dge distillation: powerful models can generate tools that help weaker model=
s perform better, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities without =
requiring everyone to run expensive, large models.</span></p><div style=3D"=

g><span> Teaching AI to solve complex programming problems is like trying t=
o train a pianist without access to challenging sheet music. While Large La=
nguage Models have shown promise in code generation, their ability to tackl=
e competition-level programming problems - the kind that require deep algor=
ithmic thinking and efficient implementations - is severely hampered by a c=
ritical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality training data. Unlike math=
 problems where you can verify answers with simple rule-based matching, cod=
e solutions need to be executed against diverse test cases that catch logic=
al errors, edge cases, and efficiency issues. Think of it like the differen=
ce between checking if 2+2=3D4 versus ensuring a sorting algorithm works co=
rrectly for arrays of different sizes, with duplicates, empty arrays, and m=
illions of elements.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=
,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>How does it solve the p=
roblem? </strong><span>rStar-Coder eses a clever three-pronged approach. Fi=
rst, the researchers collected 37.7K expert-written competitive programming=
 problems as seeds and used them to synthesize new, solvable problems - but=
 instead of just asking an LLM to create variations, they included the orig=
inal solution to help the model understand the core algorithmic concepts be=
ing tested. Second, they tackled the test case generation challenge by brea=
king it into manageable pieces: they prompted GPT-4o to create utility func=
tions that generate valid inputs of varying complexity (from 100 to 10^5 el=
ements) and validate them against problem constraints. Third, they introduc=
ed a &quot;mutual verification&quot; mechanism - they generated multiple so=
lutions using a strong reasoning model (QWQ-32B) and only accepted test cas=
es where the majority of solutions agreed on the outputs. It's like having =
multiple experts solve a problem independently; if they all arrive at the s=
ame answer, you can be confident it's correct.</span></p><p style=3D"margin=

ng>What are the key findings? </strong><span>rStar-Coder dramatically impro=
ved code reasoning capabilities, with the Qwen2.5-7B model jumping from 17.=
4% to 57.3% on LiveCodeBench, and the 14B version reaching 62.5%, actually =
beating OpenAI's o3-mini by 3.1%. On the notoriously difficult USA Computin=
g Olympiad benchmark, their 7B model achieved 16.15% accuracy, outperformin=
g the much larger QWQ-32B model - particularly impressive since QWQ-32B was=
 the very model used to generate their training solutions. The approach als=
o proved that quality trumps quantity: despite using fewer examples (580K) =
than competitors like OCR (736K) and OpenThinker2 (1M), rStar-Coder consist=
ently outperformed them. Even more surprisingly, models trained on this com=
petition-focused dataset generalized remarkably well to standard code gener=
ation tasks, with the 7B model matching Claude 3.5 Sonnet's performance on =
benchmarks like HumanEval.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Why does it matte=
r? </strong><span>These results have the potential to shift the paradigm fo=
r training code reasoning models. Rather than the endless arms race of crea=
ting ever-larger models or manually crafting millions of examples, rStar-Co=
der proves that a well-designed data generation pipeline can enable smaller=
 models to punch far above their weight class. The mutual verification mech=
anism is particularly clever - it essentially bootstraps reliability from u=
ncertainty, creating a virtuous cycle where models can verify their own syn=
thetic data. This has massive practical implications: organizations without=
 access to frontier-scale compute can now train highly capable code reasoni=
ng models, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. Perhaps most i=
ntriguingly, the fact that a 7B model can outperform the 32B teacher model =
that helped create its training data suggests we're only scratching the sur=
face of what's possible with intelligent data synthesis and verification.</=

wenLong-L1 is a progressive context scaling framework that systematically a=

ing phases to stabilize optimization; and third, a difficulty-aware retrosp=

 for reasoning-intensive tasks requires costly reinforcement learning (RL) =
with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using chain-of-thou=
ght (CoT). This paper explores incentivizing LLM reasoning through weaker s=
upervision. Weak reasoners improve performance, achieving 94% of RL gains a=
cross diverse benchmarks and model architectures. The weak-to-strong paradi=
gm offers a cost-effective alternative for incentivizing strong reasoning.<=

 reasoning and planning. The Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) bench=
mark jointly assesses these skills using dialogues about a collaborative pr=
oject, requiring an optimal schedule under temporal constraints. TCP uses p=
roblem prototypes paired with realistic scenarios; a human quality check is=
 performed. Analysis of failure cases reveals limitations in LLMs' planning=
 abilities.</p></blockquote><ol start=3D"6" style=3D"margin-top: 0;padding:=
