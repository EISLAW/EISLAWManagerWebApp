I=E2=80=99ve been kicking around Silicon Valley for a couple decades now, a=
nd trust me=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve seen my fair share of crazy startup storie=
s. But Windsurf=E2=80=99s collapse and resurrection might just be the wilde=
st yet. Imagine this: a $3 billion acquisition by OpenAI imploding in a mat=
ter of days, Microsoft flexing its IP muscles to sink the deal, and Google =
stepping in with a jaw-dropping $2.4 billion payout just to poach 42 employ=
ees=E2=80=94leaving everyone else scrambling.
And that=E2=80=99s not even the end of the story=E2=80=A6
This isn=E2=80=99t just gossip or startup theater=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a vi=
vid illustration of what=E2=80=99s happening right now in the heart of Sili=
con Valley. The AI talent wars aren=E2=80=99t just heating up=E2=80=94they=
=E2=80=99ve reached a boiling point. Founders are cashing out in ways we=E2=
=80=99ve never seen, loyalty is being tested, and the implicit trust that s=
tartups are built on is getting shredded in real-time. As someone who was a=
ctively using Windsurf when Anthropic abruptly pulled Claude access, I wasn=
=E2=80=99t just watching=E2=80=94I was feeling the chaos firsthand.
Why does this matter? Because we=E2=80=99re not just talking about a single=
 startup drama. We=E2=80=99re talking about a seismic shift in how talent, =
tech, and power intersect in the AI landscape. The stakes are enormous. Thi=
s story touches every founder who=E2=80=99s ever dreamed of an exit, every =
employee holding stock options, and every developer relying on third-party =
AI tools. It=E2=80=99s about understanding the new rules=E2=80=94or lack th=
ereof=E2=80=94that govern success and survival in today=E2=80=99s AI-driven=
 tech economy.
If you=E2=80=99re building, investing in, or even remotely interested in AI=
 startups, pay close attention. The Windsurf saga is the ultimate case stud=
y in how billion-dollar valuations can evaporate overnight, how trust can f=
racture, and how strategic moves can either destroy or save companies in th=
e blink of an eye. Buckle up=E2=80=94this is Silicon Valley=E2=80=99s AI ta=
lent war at its most brutal and revealing.=20
I=E2=80=99ve got special sidebars for founders and employees, so you are (l=
ess likely) to be left holding the bag at your company. And to wrap it up, =
I have a few reflections on what the Windsurf story tells us about the stat=
e of the industry and how AI is breaking and remaking norms and expectation=
s that have guided the Valley for decades. Come for the chaos, stay for the=
 sober reflections that help you make sense of the next Windsurf (there wil=
l be one, I promise.)

Inside Windsurf=E2=80=99s 72-Hour Meltdown: How AI Talent Wars Killed a $3B=
 Sale
This really is one of those crazy stories=E2=80=A6
Windsurf is one of the most insane startup stories I've run across in a cou=
ple decades hanging around Silicon Valley. And I=E2=80=99ve seen enough wil=
d stuff to earn the gray hairs. But Windsurf? It=E2=80=99s right up there. =
We=E2=80=99re gonna be talking about this one for years.
Look at the stakes: We're talking about a company that went from a $3 billi=
on acquisition by OpenAI to complete collapse to resurrection by a competit=
or=E2=80=94all in 72 hours. We saw Founders walking away from their own com=
pany, opening themselves to potential lawsuits from their own employees, al=
l for unprecedentedly fat paychecks. We saw Microsoft flexing legal muscles=
 (well that one=E2=80=99s not new). Ethical Anthropic playing hardball with=
 Claude. It's got everything: backstabbing, billions, and broken dreams. I =
firmly expect Aaron Sorkin to get the script assignment next week.
I was one of those actual Windsurf users watching all this go down. I had c=
ode on the line. I was coding away, happy as a clam with Claude integration=
, when Anthropic started withdrawing Claude from the platform. I complained=
, publicly. I knew it would do no good. I get it=E2=80=94if you=E2=80=99re =
Dario and you've got something called =E2=80=9CChatGPT Dev Suite=E2=80=9D c=
oming, the last thing you want is Claude's output tokens and data flowing i=
nto that environment.
My projects still felt the pain though.
We're gonna walk through this whole saga, piece by piece, so you can see ho=
w long this has been brewing. Because what happened to Windsurf isn't just =
a startup story. It's a warning shot about what happens when the AI talent =
wars break every rule Silicon Valley ever had.
Buckle up. Every time you think we=E2=80=99re done we=E2=80=99re not.
The Timeline: From GPU Tools to $3B Dreams
2021-2024: The Foundation Years
Let's rewind to 2021. Two MIT grads, Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen, start a =
company called ExaFunction. Their original focus? GPU optimization tools. S=
o even back then, they were swimming in the AI waters=E2=80=94just not the =
sexy generative AI stuff everyone's obsessed with now. These guys were earl=
y.
Then came the pivot. They saw where the puck was going and launched Codeium=
 for AI coding assistance. Smart move. By 2024, they're raising a Series C =
that values them somewhere between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion. Total ra=
ised to date? $243 million. Almost a quarter of a billion dollars.
The investor list reads like a who's who of Silicon Valley royalty. Founder=
s Fund. Kleiner Perkins. These aren't the kind of VCs who throw money at pi=
pe dreams. They saw something real here.
Late 2024 is when things get interesting. Major rebrand time. Out goes Code=
ium, in comes Windsurf. They launch this thing called the Cascade agent=E2=
=80=94basically their answer to Cursor, which was absolutely taking off at =
the time. Spoiler alert: I love Cascade, and I think whatever secret sauce =
they=E2=80=99ve got there is real. Very thoughtful, very easy to work with,=
 and they had it out before Claude Code (it reminds me a bit of Claude Code=
). Remember, this was peak "everyone's building a coding assistant" season.=
 Cursor was hot. Bolt was heating up. Lovable was starting to make noise.
Windsurf positioned itself as the full-stack app builder in that ecosystem.=
 And here's the kicker=E2=80=94they went straight for the jugular on pricin=
g. Free tier to get you hooked, then $15 per seat for premium. Cursor was c=
harging $20.
Classic disruption playbook: come in cheaper, grab market share, figure out=
 the rest later.
Little did they know "later" was about to get absolutely wild.
Q1 2025: FedRAMP and Clues to Windsurf=E2=80=99s Growth Strategy
March 11th, 2025. Mark that date. That's when Windsurf achieved something t=
hat sounds boring as hell but is actually a massive deal: FedRAMP-High cert=
ification.
If you don't know what FedRAMP-High is, count yourself blessed. Seriously. =
It=E2=80=99s worth than RBAC. It's one of those government compliance night=
mares that makes HIPAA look like a fun weekend project. We're talking about=
 the highest level of security authorization for cloud services that touch =
federal data. The kind of certification that involves so much paperwork, yo=
u could build a small fort with it.
But here's why it matters: Windsurf became the first AI coding tool approve=
d for US government workloads. First. Not Cursor. Not GitHub Copilot. Not a=
ny of the other players. Windsurf.
You know what that means? Every three-letter agency, every government contr=
actor, every company that even sniffs at federal contracts=E2=80=94they can=
 now use Windsurf. And more importantly, their competitors can't. That's no=
t just a moat. That's a fortress with crocodiles in it.
This wasn't an accident. Windsurf clearly saw the enterprise and government=
 angle as their way to differentiate. While everyone else was fighting over=
 individual developers and small teams, these guys were playing the long ga=
me with the big, boring, regulated customers.
It's like bringing a compliance manual to a knife fight. Unsexy? Sure. Effe=
ctive? You bet. Not least because you can stop those knives with lots of bu=
reaucratic paper. That was the Windsurf strategy: lean into high-compliance=
, serious enterprise industries faster than Cursor, and gain an edge on ver=
y sticky high value contracts.
They were planning to take that certification all the way to the bank. And =
for a minute there, it looked like it was going to work.
April 2025: The Good Times
Early April rolls around and Windsurf is crushing it. They (allegedly) hit =
$100 million in ARR. Now, that might not sound impressive compared to Curso=
r's numbers, but here's the context=E2=80=94they were at $40 million just a=
 few months before. That's not growth. That's a rocket ship.
The press releases are flying. Supposedly one million plus developers on th=
e platform. Over 350 enterprise customers. They're firmly in the number two=
 position behind Cursor. The Lyft to Cursor's Uber, if you will. But (they =
would argue) with better prospects.
But here's something I noticed that the numbers don't capture. And this is =
purely anecdotal, but I think it matters. When I talk to individual enginee=
rs=E2=80=94the folks actually writing code day to day=E2=80=94I hear Cursor=
 constantly. It's like the default. "Oh yeah, I use Cursor." No big deal.
But when I talk to decision makers? CTOs, engineering managers, the people =
who actually sign the checks? That's when I hear Windsurf more often. Way m=
ore than you'd expect from their market share.
Windsurf somehow punches above its weight in decision-making circles. Maybe=
 it's the enterprise features. Maybe it's that FedRAMP certification making=
 them look serious. Maybe it's just better enterprise sales. But they had t=
his weird dynamic where the bosses knew about them even if the developers d=
idn't. I can count on one hand the number of developers that preferred Wind=
surf to Cursor, but that=E2=80=99s not true of their bosses.
And that's not nothing. In enterprise software, the person writing the chec=
k sometimes matters more than the person writing the code. It's not fair, b=
ut it's true.
So=E2=80=94April 2025, life was good at Windsurf. They were the scrappy und=
erdog making real money, taking real market share, with real enterprise tra=
ction.
Then Bloomberg mixed things up.
The OpenAI Dance (April-June)
April 16th, 2025. Bloomberg breaks the news that makes every Windsurf emplo=
yee stop what they're doing and start doing math. OpenAI wants to acquire W=
indsurf. The price? $3 billion. All cash.
Let that sink in. We're at a stage in AI where a startup can drop $3 billio=
n cash to acquire another startup. That's not normal. That's not even Silic=
on Valley normal. That's "AI has completely broken the scale" normal.
Now, if you've never been through an acquisition, let me tell you what happ=
ens next. Every single person at Windsurf immediately opens Excel and start=
s calculating their payout. How many shares do I have? What's my strike pri=
ce? When do I vest? What's the tax situation?
Sidebar
I've done this dance before, and here's my advice: Don't. Do not do the mat=
h yourself. You will end up with a number that is, by definition, wrong. Yo=
u'll forget the taxes. Or the fees. Or some clause buried on page 47 of the=
 acquisition agreement that changes everything. There are a million legal w=
ays the math changes, and you'll miss most of them. Just don't bother. Wait=
 for the professionals to tell you the real number.
But I get it. Hard to resist when we're talking about $3 billion.
May rolls around. Letter of intent gets signed. Exclusive negotiation windo=
w begins. Internal memos start leaking like a sieve. The plan? Fold Windsur=
f into something called ChatGPT Dev Suite. Makes sense=E2=80=94OpenAI needs=
 a development environment, Windsurf has one. I wrote about it here [ https=
://substack.com/redirect/235d62e3-e859-4983-9391-d20354a22c8f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiN=
WtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
This is also when things get spicy. Anthropic starts withdrawing Claude fro=
m Windsurf [ https://substack.com/redirect/b69b5260-7e3b-4136-9fc3-83b8784f=
0203?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].=
 As I shared, I was not happy at the time, but it made too much sense for D=
ario. Anthropic could not give those tokens to Sam Altman.
Think about what happens when you're coding with an AI assistant. The AI wr=
ites code, you either give it a thumbs up ("great job, that worked") or you=
 correct it ("no, try this way instead"). Every interaction is a training s=
ignal. Pure gold if you're in the AI arms race.
The last thing Anthropic wants is all those beautiful Claude interactions=
=E2=80=94all that feedback data=E2=80=94flowing straight into ChatGPT Dev S=
uite. That would be like FedExing your playbook to your biggest competitor.=
 So they start pulling the plug.
Then May 6th, 2025. Definitive agreement announced (supposedly). The $3 bil=
lion price is confirmed=E2=80=94rare for these deals to not get haircut som=
ehow. Windsurf employees are popping champagne.
They think they've made it.
They have no idea what's coming.
June: Microsoft Says No
Early June, the whole thing hits a wall. And that wall's name is Satya Nade=
lla.
How? Microsoft raises IP concerns about the deal. Turns out, back in 2023 w=
hen OpenAI still needed Microsoft's money more than Microsoft needed OpenAI=
, they signed this agreement. And buried in that agreement? Microsoft gets =
rights to all OpenAI tech. Including IP rights to tech from acquisitions. C=
lassic Microsoft lawyer move to think of that clause.
Now, OpenAI didn't want to hand over Windsurf's IP to Microsoft. There's be=
en what I'll politely call a "soft separation" between Microsoft and OpenAI=
=2E Not a divorce=E2=80=94that sounds too=20=
dramatic. More like they're sleepin=
g in separate bedrooms but still sharing the mortgage. Very adult. Very pol=
ite. But the power dynamics have shifted since 2023, and you=E2=80=99ll not=
ice the latest anchor round for OpenAI was led by Softbank, not Microsoft.
OpenAI's gotten more powerful since that 2023 agreement. They're feeling th=
eir oats. Flexing their wings. So they try to play hardball. "You know what=
, Microsoft? We're acquiring Windsurf and no, you can't have the IP."
Satya's response? "Talk to my lawyers."
If you've never dealt with Microsoft lawyers, let me paint you a picture. T=
hese are the people who've been playing patent warfare since before some of=
 you were born. They've got more lawyers than some companies have employees=
=2E They eat startups for breakfast.=
 There=E2=80=99s only two sets of lawyers=
 I=E2=80=99m more scared of: Amazon lawyers and Disney lawyers (in that ord=
er).
And here's the thing=E2=80=94Satya and his legal team were right. The contr=
act was clear. Microsoft had the legal high ground. Plus, GitHub Copilot di=
rectly competes with Windsurf. Why would Microsoft hand their biggest compe=
titor a loaded weapon? Made no sense, so of course they took the power play=
=2E
So Microsoft refuses to grant an exception. No wiggle room. No negotiation.=
 Just a flat no.
Now the deal starts falling apart faster than a house of cards in a hurrica=
ne.
July 11-14: The 72-Hour Chaos
July 11th, Friday morning, 7 a.m. Pacific. The OpenAI exclusivity period of=
ficially expires. No renewal announced. The deal is "under review," which i=
s corporate speak for "dead but we're not ready to admit it yet." But I=E2=
=80=99m not the only one who can read the tea leaves.=20
By mid-morning, it's official. The $3 billion OpenAI deal has collapsed. Mi=
crosoft's IP issues get the blame, though Anthropic yanking Claude probably=
 didn't help. Think about it: if you are trying to value the deal and devel=
opers are publicly complaining while your corporate officers are in a publi=
c spat with the owners of the best coding LLM in the world, it doesn=E2=80=
=99t look great for you. One way or the other, the whole thing is toast.
But we=E2=80=99re not done yet! Here's where it gets absolutely wild.
By 3 p.m. that same day=E2=80=94the SAME DAY=E2=80=94Google announces a $2.=
4 billion deal. They must have been on the phone the second the OpenAI deal=
 died. Hell, they were probably already talking before it was official.
But this isn't your normal acquisition. Google structures this thing as a "=
reverse acquihire" with a licensing deal. And honestly? I wonder if this is=
 just a clever way to dodge FTC scrutiny. Because technically, it's not an =
acquisition. Those Google lawyers are also good.
Here's how it works: Google hires CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen,=
 and about 40 of their best engineers and R&D people. They raid the company=
=2E These 42 people split $2.4 billion.=
 Just for the talent. Plus Google gets=
 a non-exclusive license to Windsurf's tech. Non-exclusive, mind you.
Do the math on that. $2.4 billion divided by 42 people. That's almost $60 m=
illion per person (probably less since the founders got a pile, but still).=
 For joining Google. That's not an acquihire. That's a heist.
Meanwhile, the remaining 250 employees? They get nothing. Well, not quite n=
othing. They get to keep their jobs at a company that now has $100 million =
in cash, no founders, no top talent, and no exclusive rights to their own t=
echnology because Google can use it too.
The employees who didn't make the cut find out about this deal when everyon=
e else does. Can you imagine? You're celebrating a $3 billion exit on Monda=
y, and by Friday afternoon you're basically working at a zombie company whi=
le your CEO and top colleagues are splitting $2.4 billion without you.
Look, I get that Gergely Orosz has a point when he says this outcome is sti=
ll better than most startups [ https://substack.com/redirect/667de3ab-4f83-=
4ad3-b99f-65399a22acd9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], which usually just fail completely. Most startup equity =
goes to zero. At least these folks still have jobs and the company has some=
 cash.
But Gergely misses something crucial. This breaks the fundamental trust equ=
ation in Silicon Valley. There's always been this implicit contract: founde=
rs are in it for the long haul with their teams. They go down with the ship=
 or they stay aboard for victory. And sure, victory has always looked diffe=
rent=E2=80=94sometimes employees win a lot, sometimes they win a little.
But when you reward a founder for literally walking away from their company=
 and leaving 250 employees in the lurch? That's not just bad optics. That's=
 poisonous to the entire ecosystem.
The weekend is absolute chaos. Saturday morning, the structure leaks. Veste=
d employees who made the Google cut got cash payouts. Anyone with less than=
 12 months? Nothing. Which, sure, that's typical for acquisitions, but reme=
mber=E2=80=94most of these employees ARE under 12 months because the compan=
y was growing so fast.
Jeff Wang gets named interim CEO of whatever's left. They claim they'll kee=
p going, emphasize the Google license isn't exclusive. Like that matters wh=
en you've got no technical leadership.
Social media goes nuclear. #WindsurfBetrayal starts trending. Employees are=
 sharing their equity calculations that went from millions to zero. Channel=
 partners start pulling support. Industry analysts are predicting bankruptc=
y within 12 months. The remaining company gets called a zombie because ever=
yone knows it's just shuffling along until it dies. Not fun if you=E2=80=99=
re working there.
By Sunday afternoon, things look absolutely hopeless for those 250 people s=
till at Windsurf.
And then Monday happens.
July 14th. Cognition Labs, the makers of Devin, announce they're acquiring =
what's left of Windsurf. The IP, the product, the brand, the training data,=
 and=E2=80=94this is the key part=E2=80=94all 250 remaining employees.
But here's the kicker. Cognition Labs structures this completely differentl=
y. 100% employee participation. Full vesting acceleration. They waive all t=
he cliffs. Every single person gets something, whether they've been there a=
 year or a week.
Cognition saw what Google did and said, "We can be the good guy here." It's=
 brilliant, really. They get Windsurf's development environment to pair wit=
h their Devin agent. They keep that precious FedRAMP certification. And the=
y get 250 employees who are probably insanely loyal because Cognition just =
saved them from getting completely screwed.
And Cognition needs the win here. Because as much as they look like the goo=
d guys today, they=E2=80=99ve had issues building trust with developers sin=
ce launch. Part of why? The launch video was faked. They falsely claimed De=
vin was doing work on Upwork [ https://substack.com/redirect/d05b9f30-cf8d-=
4e8a-ac2f-d16417631ab5?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG=
6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] independently when Devin was doing no such thing. And of =
course they deliberately positioned Devin as a replacement for engineers=E2=
=80=94never a way to endear yourself to developers.=20
All in all, Cognition needed this win as badly as Windsurf, if not as urgen=
tly. They needed a developer name developers use. They needed a development=
 environment. They needed to look like the good guy.
Anyway, Windsurf reposts Cognition's announcement. They emphasize they're f=
riends with Anthropic again=E2=80=94Claude might come back. The show goes o=
n.
In 72 hours, we went from a $3 billion exit to complete collapse to resurre=
ction. I've been around Silicon Valley for decades. I've never seen anythin=
g like it.
Postscript: The Deal Terms Leak
Late on July 14th, the details are starting to leak out. These are alleged,=
 but if true, they paint a fascinating picture of how this whole thing went=
 down.
First, props to Jeff Wang and the Windsurf exec team. Getting acceleration =
and full participation for all employees in the Cognition deal? That's not =
just good=E2=80=94that's heroic given the circumstances. These guys basical=
ly said "if we're going down, everyone's coming with us." That's how you re=
build trust.
Here's where it gets interesting. The hypothesis is Founders Fund played pu=
ppet master here. They're investors in both Windsurf AND Cognition. Conveni=
ent, right? Nothing like having the same VC in both cap tables to grease th=
e wheels when you need a quick deal. I'd bet money they were on the phone t=
he second the Google deal was announced, orchestrating a rescue mission. Fr=
ankly they probably needed it for their own reputation with other portfolio=
 companies.
Now, let's talk numbers. The speculation is $200-400M for the acquisition. =
Here's how that math might have worked:
Windsurf at $80M+ ARR, doubling year-over-year? Normally that's worth $250-=
500M in this market
But they just got abandoned by their founders and lost their star engineers
Haircut that valuation by 50% or more: $100-200M
Add in the $100M cash they had lying around
Total consideration: $200-300M
If that's right, Cognition just got an absolute steal. They're paying maybe=
 5-8% of their company (they were last valued at $4B) for a perfect product=
 fit, 250 trained employees, and that golden FedRAMP certification.
Here's the kicker=E2=80=94this was apparently all Cognition stock. An all s=
tock deal with high upside is good for the team. Not cash good. But good. I=
t=E2=80=99s a long shot, but the employees who got "screwed" might have act=
ually gotten a better deal than the ones who went to Google. Or at least, y=
ou can believe that if you choose (and that hopeful maybe-not-fiction is wh=
y startups exist).
So grab some coffee and let all this sink in.
The product fit is obviously perfect. Devin needs a development environment=
 (and brand help). Windsurf is a development environment with a more truste=
d name than Devin. It's like peanut butter meeting jelly. Scott Wu at Cogni=
tion played his hand well.
But here's what worries me: culture. Cognition just went from 80 people to =
300 overnight. That's not growth=E2=80=94that's a heart transplant. And the=
 incoming Windsurf folks are heavy on go-to-market and sales, while Cogniti=
on is mostly product and engineering nerds. Complementary? Sure. Potential =
for organ rejection? Absolutely.
The integration is going to be everything. Get it right, and you've got a j=
uggernaut. Get it wrong, and you've got two companies wearing the same t-sh=
irt pretending to be friends.
But here's the real tell: The Windsurf team sold IMMEDIATELY. They didn't e=
ven try to go it alone. They didn't shop around. They went straight to a co=
mpetitor that Google definitely didn't want to get stronger.
That tells you everything. These weren't people who wanted to "operate the =
business standalone" or "pursue our vision independently" or whatever corpo=
rate BS usually gets spouted. They wanted to GO BIG. They wanted to compete=
=2E They wanted to win. And maybe they wanted a taste of revenge.
And honestly? Good for them. After getting abandoned by their founders, the=
y could have curled up and died. Instead, they found their own path forward=
=2E
The AI coding space just got a lot more interesting. And despite all the dr=
ama, all the backstabbing, all the billions flying around=E2=80=94the emplo=
yees got taken care of. It's not the immediate, liquid exit they were dream=
ing of. But in this market, in this situation? It's pretty damn good.
Sometimes the best revenge is just refusing to die.
Sidebar: Implications for Startup Employees
The Harsh Truth About Your Equity
Let's have a real talk about what the Windsurf story means for you, the sta=
rtup employee sitting there with your stock options and your dreams. Or you=
r friend you have drinks with while they complain about startup life=E2=80=
=A6
First, the bad news: Your equity can go from millions to zero overnight, an=
d there's basically nothing you can do about it. Those 250 Windsurf employe=
es who didn't make Google's cut? They did everything right. Worked hard. Sh=
ipped product. Helped build a billion-dollar company. And they got zilch.
The lesson? Your equity is worth exactly $0 until it's liquid cash in your =
bank account. Not when your company raises at a unicorn valuation. Not when=
 acquisition talks start. Not even when the definitive agreement is signed.=
 Zero. Until. Cash.
And you get even less options if you=E2=80=99ve been at the company less th=
an 12 months. It=E2=80=99s just true.
The New (Old) Playbook for Startup Employees
So what do you do with this knowledge? Here's the five lessons you need to =
engrave on your laptop:
1. Negotiate salary first, equity second. The old Silicon Valley wisdom was=
 to trade salary for equity. That made sense when founders stuck around. No=
w? Get paid market rate. Treat equity as a lottery ticket, not a retirement=
 plan.
2. Understand your acceleration clauses. Single-trigger? Double-trigger? No=
 acceleration? These aren't boring legal terms anymore=E2=80=94they're the =
difference between millions and nothing. If your equity doesn't accelerate =
on acquisition, you're basically hoping management likes you enough to incl=
ude you in the deal. During the 2010=E2=80=99s a lot of us just=E2=80=A6ign=
ored this legal stuff even if we knew we shouldn=E2=80=99t. Don=E2=80=99t d=
o that.
3. Watch for the warning signs. When Anthropic pulled Claude from Windsurf,=
 users were pissed but employees should have been terrified. When your comp=
any's core partnership falls apart, update your resume. Don't wait for the =
all-hands where they announce the "strategic restructuring." Also, let this=
 remind us all that if we are one model maker=E2=80=99s hissing fit away fr=
om a disaster, we have less product market fit than we thought.
4. The one-year cliff is a killer. Cognition waiving cliffs for all employe=
es? That's the exception, not the rule. If you're under a year and acquisit=
ion talks start, you're probably screwed. Plan accordingly. And if it happe=
ns, be a grownup about it. I=E2=80=99ve been there. It=E2=80=99s how the ga=
me is played. The employees who stayed longer should be rewarded.
5. Your leverage is your skills, not your loyalty. This one hurts to write,=
 but it's true. In a world where founders abandon ship for $60 million payo=
uts, your loyalty is a nice-to-have, not a must-have. Keep your skills shar=
p. Keep your network warm. Keep your options open. I feel like this one, at=
 least, got learned after 2022 by everybody. I=E2=80=99ll just say it again=
 here.
The Silver Lining (Sort Of)
Here's the thing though=E2=80=94we're also in the greatest AI talent market=
 in history. Those 42 people who went to Google? They're set for life. The =
250 who landed at Cognition? They ended up at a company that actually value=
s them.
And you? You're working in AI (or interested in AI if you=E2=80=99re readin=
g this) during the biggest technological shift of our lifetimes. Your skill=
s are more valuable than ever. Companies are paying insane amounts for AI t=
alent. Even if your current equity goes to zero, your next job could pay 2x=
 what you're making now.
The game has changed. The old "join a startup, vest for four years, pray fo=
r an exit" playbook is dead. The new playbook is messier, less fair, but al=
so full of more opportunity than ever.
Just don't bet your kids' college funds on those stock options.
Three Big Lessons
1. The Talent Wars Have Broken Silicon Valley
This whole Windsurf saga underscores something that should worry everyone w=
ho cares about Silicon Valley: the talent wars have completely broken the n=
ormal incentive structures. And yes, I know the Valley is annoying, but con=
sidering its=E2=80=99 outsize economic impact we all have to care when tren=
ds there change.
When you can pay a founder=E2=80=94someone who was already a multi-milliona=
ire=E2=80=94so much money that they'll abandon their company and become an =
employee, something's fundamentally wrong. The model is broken. These found=
ers didn't just leave. They potentially exposed themselves to lawsuits for =
breaching their fiduciary duty. They broke a code of honor that's been sacr=
ed in the Valley for decades.
And they did it anyway. Because Google's check was that big.=20
We're seeing this everywhere now. Zuck just poached Apple's head of AI for =
$200 million. That's more than Tim Cook makes, depending on how you count t=
he equity. When you're throwing around those numbers, you break everything.
Here's the problem: If you can be a $200 million employee, why would you ev=
er found a company? Why take the risk? Why deal with the stress? Why be loy=
al to your team?
The whole Silicon Valley ecosystem runs on founders believing they'll build=
 something big with their teams. When that belief breaks down=E2=80=94when =
founders will bail for unprecedentedly fat paychecks=E2=80=94the whole thin=
g starts to crumble.
This isn't just bad for morale. It's an existential threat to how startups =
work.
2. Model Makers vs Tool Makers: The Real Battle
The second lesson is about the massive tectonic plates shifting under the A=
I industry. We're seeing a brutal struggle between the model makers (OpenAI=
, Anthropic, Google) and the tool makers trying to build on top of them.
The model makers hold most of the cards. Think about what Anthropic did=E2=
=80=94they just yanked Claude access and nearly killed Windsurf's product o=
vernight. That's power. Real power.
But here's the thing: the model makers are also hungry. They look at these =
tool companies and think, "Why should you capture that value? Our models ar=
e doing the real work." Claude Code is literally just a terminal, but it co=
mpetes directly with Cursor. The model makers think they can eat these tool=
s for lunch just by making their models better.
I'd say it's about a two-thirds, one-third power split. Model makers have t=
wo-thirds of the leverage, but tool makers still have that crucial one-thir=
d. Because at the end of the day, someone needs to build the interfaces, ha=
ndle the enterprise sales, get those government certifications. Build a dis=
tribution relationship around a specific industry and application.
Windsurf still got acquired. They're still going to be a company. That FedR=
AMP-High certification didn't go to Claude Code=E2=80=94it stayed with Wind=
surf. Tool makers aren't dead.
But man, they're going to have to negotiate carefully. Every tool company n=
ow knows they're one API change away from disaster.=20
I=E2=80=99ll say it again: check your thinking on your product market fit. =
If your fit depends on a model maker, then maybe they have the market fit. =
Not you.
3. Agents in Code: The Tip of the Spear
The third lesson is about where all this is heading. Coding agents aren't j=
ust another AI application. They're the tip of the spear for where the enti=
re industry is going.
Why? Because code is easy to reward. It either runs or it doesn't. You get =
immediate, clear feedback that can train models. That's why we're seeing so=
 much innovation here first.
Devin acquiring Windsurf isn't just about saving a company. It's about the =
agentic agenda moving forward. We're going to see development environments =
and agent management systems merge into these hybrid platforms. Cursor's al=
ready doing it with their own model. Now Devin's doing it with Windsurf.
And here's what's wild=E2=80=94mobile is becoming huge for developers. Not =
for writing code on your phone, but for managing agents from anywhere. You =
can deploy an agent from your phone and have it cranking out code while you=
're at lunch. That's a fundamental shift in how development works.
This is all early days. What we're seeing in coding is going to happen ever=
ywhere AI can get clear feedback signals. Customer service, data analysis, =
content creation=E2=80=94anywhere you can tell if the AI did a good job or =
not.
The evolution from autocomplete to genuine coding agents to actual AI cowor=
kers? That's not the future. That's happening right now. Windsurf's story i=
s just the messy birth of this new world.
Sidebar: The Model Wars Survival Guide for Founders
The New Reality: You're Building on Quicksand
If you're a founder building AI tools right now, the Windsurf story should =
have you sweating bullets. But it should also have you thinking strategical=
ly. Because this isn't going away=E2=80=94this is the new normal.
Here's the brutal truth: If you're building on top of someone else's model,=
 you're one API change away from extinction. Anthropic proved that with Cla=
ude. One day you're humming along, the next day your core feature is gone. =
Poof.
So how do you build a defensible business when the ground keeps shifting un=
der your feet?
The Strategic Playbook
1. Multi-model or die. Windsurf's fatal flaw? Too much dependence on Claude=
=2E Never, ever let one model provider=20=
have a gun to your head. Support OpenA=
I, Anthropic, Google, and ideally some open-source options. Make model-swit=
ching a core feature, not an afterthought. Your users should be able to fli=
p between models like changing TV channels.
2. Own something the models can't. What did Windsurf have that OpenAI wante=
d? FedRAMP certification. Enterprise relationships. Government contracts. T=
hese are moats that take years to build and can't be replicated by just shi=
pping a better model. Find your equivalent. I wrote about startup strategy =
here [ https://substack.com/redirect/318f6f67-d99f-4fb5-a583-17736ab732c6?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Maybe=
 it's:
Compliance and certifications (HIPAA, SOC2, FedRAMP)
Industry-specific workflows they'll never bother to build
Data and feedback loops from your specific use case
Distribution channels models providers can't access
3. The integration play is dead. Go deeper. Just wrapping an API with a nic=
e UI isn't enough anymore. Cursor didn't win by just integrating models=E2=
=80=94they built their own. Cognition didn't just use models=E2=80=94they b=
uilt Devin. You need to add genuine technical value that compounds over tim=
e.
4. Pick your sugar daddy carefully. If you're going to align with a model m=
aker, understand what you're signing up for. OpenAI wants to own everything=
=2E Google will acquihire your talent a=
nd leave your company for dead. Anthro=
pic will pull access if you flirt with competitors. Microsoft will enforce =
every clause in every contract. Choose wisely.
5. The enterprise escape hatch. Notice how Windsurf had way better penetrat=
ion with decision makers than developers? That wasn't an accident. Enterpri=
se buyers care about boring stuff=E2=80=94support, SLAs, compliance, integr=
ation with their Byzantine tech stacks. Model makers hate this stuff. It's =
your opportunity.
The Three Paths Forward
Looking at the landscape, I see three viable strategies for AI tool builder=
s:
Path 1: The Switzerland Play
 Be aggressively neutral. Support every model. Build the best tool regardle=
ss of who provides the intelligence. Develop deep technical moats around th=
e integration and workflow layer. Think Photoshop=E2=80=94Adobe doesn't car=
e whose camera took the photo.
Path 2: The Vertical Domination Play
 Pick an industry or use case so specific that model makers won't bother. B=
ecome the undisputed king of AI for dentists or AI for architectural drawin=
gs or AI for whatever niche you choose. Build workflows so specialized that=
 general models can't compete.
Path 3: The Full Stack Play
 If you can't beat them, compete with them. Build your own models for your =
specific use case. Fine-tune open source. Develop proprietary architectures=
=2E Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it's hard=
=2E But it's the only way to truly contr=
ol your destiny. Cursor is playing this game.
The Questions Every Founder Should Ask
Before you build anything in the AI tools space, answer these:
If [dominant model provider] cuts off my access tomorrow, do I still have a=
 business?
What do I own that would take a model maker 2+ years to replicate?
Which path am I taking, and do I have the resources to see it through?
Am I building something people need, or just arbitraging temporary API acce=
ss?
The Bottom Line
The model makers are playing for keeps. They've got billions in funding, th=
e best researchers, and no qualms about crushing tool builders who get too =
comfortable. But they're also slow, bureaucratic, and allergic to boring en=
terprise requirements.
Your opportunity lives in those gaps. Build something genuinely valuable. P=
rotect yourself with multi-model support. Own your customer relationships. =
And whatever you do, don't put all your eggs in one model maker's basket.
Because as Windsurf learned, those baskets have a tendency to disappear rig=
ht when you need them most.
And if someone offers you $60 million to walk away? Well... that's between =
you and your conscience.
The Bigger Picture
Look, this isn't just about one company getting jerked around by bigger pla=
yers. The Windsurf saga is a preview of the next five years in AI.
We're watching LLMs evolve from cute autocomplete toys to genuine coding ag=
ents right before our eyes. Remember when GitHub Copilot first came out and=
 we were all impressed it could finish a function? That was like, what, 202=
1? Ancient history. Now we've got agents that can build entire features, re=
factor codebases, and debug complex problems.
And everyone wants a piece of this action. That's why the Windsurf deal got=
 so messy.
OpenAI wanted Windsurf because they need a development environment. They've=
 got the models but no real way for developers to use them beyond API calls=
 and ChatGPT. That's like having a Ferrari engine but no car to put it in.
Google REALLY wanted Windsurf=E2=80=94or at least the talent=E2=80=94becaus=
e they're even further behind. They've got Gemini doing impressive things, =
but where's their Cursor? Where's their development environment? Nowhere. T=
hey needed this. That's why they moved so fast and threw $2.4 billion at 42=
 people. Desperate times, desperate measures.
And that FedRAMP certification? Everyone's sleeping on how important that i=
s. Cognition didn't just buy a broken company. They bought a golden ticket =
into every government contract, every regulated industry, every enterprise =
that takes security seriously. You can't just apply for FedRAMP-High and ge=
t it. It takes time. Millions of dollars. Pain you wouldn't believe.
Devin with FedRAMP certification could be the first AI coding agent approve=
d for government work. Think about that. Every defense contractor, every fe=
deral agency, every company that touches government data=E2=80=94they all b=
ecome potential customers overnight.
The real story here is that we're in the middle of a platform war that make=
s the mobile OS wars look quaint. It's not about iOS vs Android anymore. It=
's about who owns the layer where humans and AI meet. The development envir=
onment is just the first battleground.
And the stakes? They're astronomical. We're talking about the future of how=
 all software gets built. The company that wins this space doesn't just get=
 revenue. They get to shape how humans and AI work together for the next de=
cade.
That's what Windsurf represented. That's why everyone wanted it. And that's=
 why the fight got so ugly.
What Would You Do?
So there you have it. One of the most eventful startup stories of the last =
couple decades, and I've seen some doozies. A company goes from hero to zer=
o to zombie to reborn=E2=80=94all in the span of a few months. Billions of =
dollars flying around. Founders abandoning ship. Microsoft playing kingmake=
r. Anthropic playing defense. Google swooping in like a vulture. Cognition =
playing the white knight.
It's exhausting just recounting it. Imagine living it.
But here's the question that keeps rattling around my brain: What would you=
 do in Windsurf's shoes?
I mean really think about it. You're Varun Mohan or Douglas Chen. You've bu=
ilt this company from nothing. Raised quarter billion dollars. Got a thousa=
nd developers using your product. You're on track to be the number two play=
er in a massive market.
Then Google shows up with a briefcase. Inside is more money than most peopl=
e see in ten lifetimes. All you have to do is walk away. Leave your 250 emp=
loyees behind. Break the implicit promise that you're all in this together.
Do you take it?
The idealist in me wants to say hell no. You dance with the ones who brough=
t you. You stick with your team. You see it through. That's the Silicon Val=
ley way. Or at least, it used to be.
But the realist in me gets it. When someone offers you generational wealth,=
 when the delta between taking the money and not taking it is $50+ million,=
 when you've got family to think about... man, those principles start looki=
ng expensive.
And that's what scares me about where this leaves the ecosystem. If founder=
s can be bought out from under their companies, if the talent wars are so s=
picy with AI dollars now that they mean loyalty is just another asset to be=
 acquired, then what happens to the whole startup dream?
We're entering uncharted territory here. The old rules don't apply. The soc=
ial contracts that built Silicon Valley are being rewritten by companies wi=
th more money than God and an AI arms race that makes the cold war look chi=
ll.
Maybe Cognition's approach is the future=E2=80=94coming in as the good guy,=
 making everyone whole, building trust in a trustless world. Or maybe that'=
s just the exception that proves the rule.
I honestly don't know.
What I do know is that the Windsurf story isn't over. Hell, it might just b=
e getting started. We've got agents in code today. Tomorrow it'll be agents=
 everywhere. The same forces that tore Windsurf apart and put it back toget=
her are going to hit every industry AI touches.
Which is to say, all of them.
So I'll ask you again: What would you do? Take the money and run? Stick wit=
h your team? Try to find some middle ground?
And more importantly: What do you think this means for the next startup tha=
t gets caught between the model makers and their billions?
Because trust me, there will be a next one. And the stakes will only get hi=
gher.
Drop a comment. Tell me what you think. I'm genuinely curious where people =
land on this.
After all, in a world where founders can make $60 million by walking away, =
we better figure out what we actually value.
Before it's too late.

decades hanging around Silicon Valley. And I=E2=80=99ve seen enough wild st=

 at the stakes: We're talking about a company that went from a $3 billion a=
cquisition by OpenAI to complete collapse to resurrection by a competitor=
=E2=80=94all in 72 hours. We saw Founders walking away from their own compa=
ny, opening themselves to potential lawsuits from their own employees, all =
for unprecedentedly fat paychecks. We saw Microsoft flexing legal muscles (=
well that one=E2=80=99s not new). Ethical Anthropic playing hardball with C=
laude. It's got everything: backstabbing, billions, and broken dreams. I fi=
rmly expect Aaron Sorkin to get the script assignment next week.</p><p styl=

PU optimization tools. So even back then, they were swimming in the AI wate=

ere the puck was going and launched Codeium for AI coding assistance. Smart=
 move. By 2024, they're raising a Series C that values them somewhere betwe=

Major rebrand time. Out goes Codeium, in comes Windsurf. They launch this t=

ch was absolutely taking off at the time. Spoiler alert: I love Cascade, an=
d I think whatever secret sauce they=E2=80=99ve got there is real. Very tho=
ughtful, very easy to work with, and they had it out before Claude Code (it=
 reminds me a bit of Claude Code). Remember, this was peak &quot;everyone's=

hat means? Every three-letter agency, every government contractor, every co=
mpany that even sniffs at federal contracts=E2=80=94they can now use Windsu=
rf. And more importantly, their competitors can't. That's not just a moat. =
That's a fortress with crocodiles in it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;=
color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This wasn't an acc=
ident. Windsurf clearly saw the enterprise and government angle as their wa=
y to differentiate. While everyone else was fighting over individual develo=
pers and small teams, these guys were playing the long game with the big, b=
oring, regulated customers.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54=

<strong>That was the Windsurf strategy: lean into high-compliance, serious =

Times</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line=
-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Early April rolls around and Windsurf is cr=
ushing it. They (allegedly) hit $100 million in ARR. Now, that might not so=
und impressive compared to Cursor's numbers, but here's the context=E2=80=
=94they were at $40 million just a few months before. That's not growth. Th=
at's a rocket ship.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);=
line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The press releases are flying. Supposed=
ly one million plus developers on the platform. Over 350 enterprise custome=
rs. They're firmly in the number two position behind Cursor. The Lyft to Cu=
rsor's Uber, if you will. But (they would argue) with better prospects.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">But here's something I noticed that the numbers don't capture.=
 And this is purely anecdotal, but I think it matters. When I talk to indiv=
idual engineers=E2=80=94the folks actually writing code day to day=E2=80=94=
I hear Cursor constantly. It's like the default. &quot;Oh yeah, I use Curso=
r.&quot; No big deal.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=
);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But when I talk to decision makers? C=
TOs, engineering managers, the people who actually sign the checks? That's =
when I hear Windsurf more often. Way more than you'd expect from their mark=
et share.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heigh=
t: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Windsurf somehow punches above its weight in deci=
sion-making circles. Maybe it's the enterprise features. Maybe it's that Fe=
dRAMP certification making them look serious. Maybe it's just better enterp=
rise sales. But they had this weird dynamic where the bosses knew about the=
m even if the developers didn't. I can count on one hand the number of deve=
lopers that preferred Windsurf to Cursor, but that=E2=80=99s not true of th=
eir bosses.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-hei=
ght: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And that's not nothing. In enterprise software,=
 the person writing the check sometimes matters more than the person writin=

deal? That's not just good=E2=80=94that's heroic given the circumstances. T=

s interesting. The hypothesis is Founders Fund played puppet master here. T=
hey're investors in both Windsurf AND Cognition. Convenient, right? Nothing=
 like having the same VC in both cap tables to grease the wheels when you n=

all Cognition stock. An all stock deal with high upside is good for the tea=
m. Not cash good. But good. It=E2=80=99s a long shot, but the employees who=

vin. It's like peanut butter meeting jelly. Scott Wu at Cognition played hi=

 just went from 80 people to 300 overnight. That's not growth=E2=80=94that'=
s a heart transplant. And the incoming Windsurf folks are heavy on go-to-ma=
rket and sales, while Cognition is mostly product and engineering nerds. Co=
mplementary? Sure. Potential for organ rejection? Absolutely.</p><p style=

 t-shirt pretending to be friends.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's the real tell=
: The Windsurf team sold IMMEDIATELY. They didn't even try to go it alone. =
They didn't shop around. They went straight to a competitor that Google def=
initely didn't want to get stronger.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>That tells you e=
verything. These weren't people who wanted to &quot;operate the business st=
andalone&quot; or &quot;pursue our vision independently&quot; or whatever c=
orporate BS usually gets spouted. They wanted to GO BIG. They wanted to com=
pete. They wanted to win. </span><strong>And maybe they wanted a taste of r=

they found their own path forward.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=

 got a lot more interesting. And despite all the drama, all the backstabbin=
g, all the billions flying around=E2=80=94the employees got taken care of. =
It's not the immediate, liquid exit they were dreaming of. But in this mark=
et, in this situation? It's pretty damn good.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

ong>2. Understand your acceleration clauses.</strong><span> Single-trigger?=
 Double-trigger? No acceleration? These aren't boring legal terms anymore=
=E2=80=94they're the difference between millions and nothing. If your equit=
y doesn't accelerate on acquisition, you're basically hoping management lik=
es you enough to include you in the deal. During the 2010=E2=80=99s a lot o=
f us just=E2=80=A6ignored this legal stuff even if we knew we shouldn=E2=80=

e warning signs.</strong><span> When Anthropic pulled Claude from Windsurf,=
 users were pissed but employees should have been terrified. When your comp=
any's core partnership falls apart, update your resume. Don't wait for the =
all-hands where they announce the &quot;strategic restructuring.&quot; </sp=

 killer.</strong><span> Cognition waiving cliffs for all employees? That's =
the exception, not the rule. If you're under a year and acquisition talks s=
tart, you're probably screwed. Plan accordingly. And if it happens, be a gr=
ownup about it. I=E2=80=99ve been there. It=E2=80=99s how the game is playe=

2. Model Makers vs Tool Makers: The Real Battle</strong></h3><p style=3D"ma=
rgin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">T=
he second lesson is about the massive tectonic plates shifting under the AI=
 industry. We're seeing a brutal struggle between the model makers (OpenAI,=
 Anthropic, Google) and the tool makers trying to build on top of them.</p>=
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-=
size: 16px;">The model makers hold most of the cards. Think about what Anth=
ropic did=E2=80=94they just yanked Claude access and nearly killed Windsurf=
's product overnight. That's power. Real power.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But here's =
the thing: the model makers are also hungry. They look at these tool compan=
ies and think, &quot;Why should you capture that value? Our models are doin=
g the real work.&quot; Claude Code is literally just a terminal, but it com=
petes directly with Cursor. The model makers think they can eat these tools=
 for lunch just by making their models better.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">I'd say it's=
 about a two-thirds, one-third power split. Model makers have two-thirds of=
 the leverage, but tool makers still have that crucial one-third. Because a=
t the end of the day, someone needs to build the interfaces, handle the ent=
erprise sales, get those government certifications. Build a distribution re=
lationship around a specific industry and application.</p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Wind=

away from disaster. </p><blockquote style=3D"border-left: 4px solid #45D800=

 get immediate, clear feedback that can train models. That's why we're seei=

 own model. Now Devin's doing it with Windsurf.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =

b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The model makers are playin=
g for keeps. They've got billions in funding, the best researchers, and no =
qualms about crushing tool builders who get too comfortable. But they're al=
so slow, bureaucratic, and allergic to boring enterprise requirements.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">Your opportunity lives in those gaps. Build something genuinely=
 valuable. Protect yourself with multi-model support. Own your customer rel=
ationships. And whatever you do, don't put all your eggs in one model maker=
's basket.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Because as Windsurf learned, those baskets have =
a tendency to disappear right when you need them most.</p><p style=3D"margi=

s in AI.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height=
: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We're watching LLMs evolve from cute autocomplete =
toys to genuine coding agents right before our eyes. Remember when GitHub C=
opilot first came out and we were all impressed it could finish a function?=
 That was like, what, 2021? Ancient history. Now we've got agents that can =
build entire features, refactor codebases, and debug complex problems.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=

urf deal got so messy.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">OpenAI wanted Windsurf because they =
need a development environment. They've got the models but no real way for =
developers to use them beyond API calls and ChatGPT. That's like having a F=
errari engine but no car to put it in.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Google REALLY wanted=
 Windsurf=E2=80=94or at least the talent=E2=80=94because they're even furth=
er behind. They've got Gemini doing impressive things, but where's their Cu=
rsor? Where's their development environment? Nowhere. They needed this. Tha=
t's why they moved so fast and threw $2.4 billion at 42 people. Desperate t=
imes, desperate measures.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=

veryone's sleeping on how important that is. Cognition didn't just buy a br=
oken company. They bought a golden ticket into every government contract, e=
very regulated industry, every enterprise that takes security seriously. Yo=
u can't just apply for FedRAMP-High and get it. It takes time. Millions of =
dollars. Pain you wouldn't believe.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color=

20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So there yo=
u have it. One of the most eventful startup stories of the last couple deca=
des, and I've seen some doozies. A company goes from hero to zero to zombie=
 to reborn=E2=80=94all in the span of a few months. Billions of dollars fly=
ing around. Founders abandoning ship. Microsoft playing kingmaker. Anthropi=
c playing defense. Google swooping in like a vulture. Cognition playing the=
 white knight.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">It's exhausting just recounting it. Imagine =
living it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>But here's the question that keeps rattlin=
g around my brain: </span><strong>What would you do in Windsurf's shoes?</s=
trong></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">I mean really think about it. You're Varun Mohan or =
Douglas Chen. You've built this company from nothing. Raised quarter billio=
n dollars. Got a thousand developers using your product. You're on track to=
 be the number two player in a massive market.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 2=
0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Then Google =
shows up with a briefcase. Inside is more money than most people see in ten=
 lifetimes. All you have to do is walk away. Leave your 250 employees behin=
d. Break the implicit promise that you're all in this together.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Do you take it?</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The idealist in me wants to say hell n=
o. You dance with the ones who brought you. You stick with your team. You s=
ee it through. That's the Silicon Valley way. Or at least, it used to be.</=
p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=
t-size: 16px;">But the realist in me gets it. When someone offers you gener=
ational wealth, when the delta between taking the money and not taking it i=
s $50+ million, when you've got family to think about... man, those princip=
les start looking expensive.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><span>And that's what scares m=
e about where this leaves the ecosystem. If founders can be bought out from=
 under their companies, </span><strong>if the talent wars are so spicy with=
 AI dollars now that they mean loyalty is just another asset to be acquired=
, then what happens to the whole startup dream?</strong></p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We=
're entering uncharted territory here. The old rules don't apply. The socia=
l contracts that built Silicon Valley are being rewritten by companies with=
 more money than God and an AI arms race that makes the cold war look chill=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">Maybe Cognition's approach is the future=E2=80=94coming i=
n as the good guy, making everyone whole, building trust in a trustless wor=
ld. Or maybe that's just the exception that proves the rule.</p><p style=3D=

tore Windsurf apart and put it back together are going to hit every industr=
