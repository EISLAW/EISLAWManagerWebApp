Seriously Sam Altman cannot go more than 2 days without trying to grab the =
news cycle. This week was supposed to be about Google, Microsoft, Anthropic=
=E2=80=94anyone but OpenAI. I wrote about it here [ https://substack.com/re=
direct/ecd6c88c-3204-4496-95e2-5ea5b882a812?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88Y=
FxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. And until Wednesday we were roughly=
 on track. Microsoft had a big keynote on Monday. Google went Tuesday (and =
Wednesday). Microsoft is continuing during the week. Anthropic is set to go=
 Thursday.=20
But then Wednesday morning OpenAI interrupted everything by very publicly a=
nnouncing that the most famous designer on the planet had permanently joine=
d OpenAI in a massive all-stock deal valued at $6.5B, with the responsibili=
ty to build a rumored iPhone killer.=20
And Jony is a big deal! He=E2=80=99s the spiritual protege of Steve Jobs. H=
e gets credit for being the design mind behind Apple=E2=80=99s hardware. He=
 was on stage recently [ https://substack.com/redirect/5c75f3b1-6dc6-469c-a=
ee5-1879013b8171?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4t=
AjMRMPOw0 ] talking about the value of design as the language of the future=
 with Stripe. He is also someone I personally respect very highly=E2=80=94a=
nd regardless of how this deal pans out my personal regard for his legacy i=
sn=E2=80=99t going to change.
And now Sir Jony has been charged with designing the future of our world wi=
th AI. And he and Sam Altman are thinking that big and bold about all of th=
is. Read on for a much deeper dive on the deal. How this impacts us, what s=
caling up device supply chain looks like, how this shapes the race with App=
le and Google=E2=80=94and how this ties into that other exec hire from Open=
AI last week. Lots to dig into!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
OpenAI breaking the news cycle
I got distracted yesterday by OpenAI=E2=80=99s most expensive line-item yet=
: roughly $6.5 billion in stock to absorb io, Jony Ive=E2=80=99s stealth ha=
rdware studio=E2=80=94and, by extension, Ive himself. On paper that makes t=
he iPhone=E2=80=99s designer =E2=80=9Ccreative head=E2=80=9D across every f=
uture GPT-native object; in practice it declares that generative AI=E2=80=
=99s next interface won=E2=80=99t live inside somebody else=E2=80=99s slab =
of glass. Altman wants to ship the slab=E2=80=94or whatever comes after it=
=E2=80=94on his own terms.
Early leaks call the prototype screen-less, even =E2=80=9Cnot a phone.=E2=
=80=9D Some reporting last fall framed it as a lightweight wearable, possib=
ly glasses, built for continuous vision and voice rather than taps and swip=
es. Industry watchers from TechRadar to the Financial Times have echoed tha=
t rumor, arguing that glasses (or similar head-worn gear) make more sense t=
han trying to pry users away from mature smartphones.
If that=E2=80=99s right, OpenAI is betting that AI needs a form factor you =
forget you=E2=80=99re wearing=E2=80=94something able to see, hear, and spea=
k in real time=E2=80=94more than it needs another bright rectangle. The str=
ategic upside is clear: ownership of both model and medium could undercut A=
pple=E2=80=99s long-gestating Vision-lite glasses, Google=E2=80=99s Project=
 Moohan, and Meta=E2=80=99s Ray-Ban lineup before they scale. The hard part=
 isn=E2=80=99t aesthetics (Ive has that covered); it=E2=80=99s battery life=
, edge inference, privacy optics, and a supply chain that can turn a beauti=
ful prototype into millions of units by 2026. That=E2=80=99s the execution =
cliff OpenAI just signed up to climb.
The timing is surgical. Microsoft Build opened Monday (May 19 =E2=80=93 22)=
, flooding the feed with Copilot+ PCs and multi-agent demos. Google I/O fol=
lowed on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 20=E2=80=9321), pitching Gemini as the =
fabric of Android and teasing its own XR glasses prototype. Then=E2=80=94mi=
d-keynote lull=E2=80=94OpenAI drops a blog post titled =E2=80=9CSam & Jony =
introduce io=E2=80=9D and wires out a $6.5 billion term sheet. In an =E2=80=
=9CAI super-week=E2=80=9D engineered to showcase Big Tech=E2=80=99s next mo=
ves, Altman hijacked the news cycle with a single acquisition, turning Goog=
le=E2=80=99s and Microsoft=E2=80=99s developer rallies into backdrop for hi=
s own platform play.
The move also reframes every on-stage promise those conferences just made. =
Google showed Gemini Live translating in real time; Microsoft touted agenti=
c orchestration atop Windows. OpenAI=E2=80=99s counter-message is, in effec=
t, =E2=80=9CNice software=E2=80=94now watch us ship the hardware it actuall=
y deserves.=E2=80=9D By placing Ive=E2=80=99s wearable rumors in the same n=
ews window, OpenAI forces analysts to ask whether the real post-phone form =
factor will come from the model company itself, not the incumbents. That=E2=
=80=99s PR Jiu-Jitsu: leverage your rivals=E2=80=99 megaphones to announce =
that the race just changed lanes.
The terms of the deal
Here=E2=80=99s what actually happened. OpenAI is printing roughly $6.5 bill=
ion in fresh equity=E2=80=94valued off its own $300 billion internal mark=
=E2=80=94and handing it to io, the year-old hardware venture Jony Ive spun =
up after leaving Apple. The swap is all stock, no cash, which means OpenAI =
preserves its war-chest while Ive and his co-founders take a meaningful bit=
e of the cap table. Every one of io=E2=80=99s fifty-five engineers, product=
 thinkers, and prototyping specialists decamps to OpenAI=E2=80=99s San Fran=
cisco HQ; the company itself disappears into the mothership. Ive=E2=80=99s =
separate practice, LoveFrom, stays independent but locks in a long-term ret=
ainer to steer industrial design across OpenAI=E2=80=99s entire lineup.
The relationship isn=E2=80=99t new. Ive, Sam Altman, and a skunk-works crew=
 started whiteboarding =E2=80=9CAI-native objects=E2=80=9D as early as 2023=
 and even courted SoftBank for a billion-dollar outside round before decidi=
ng to keep the cap table tight. In other words, what looks like a splashy b=
uyout is really the formal marriage of a two-year clandestine courtship. By=
 rolling the venture in-house, Altman guarantees that the next interface la=
yer for GPT arrives on his schedule, not Masayoshi Son=E2=80=99s=E2=80=94an=
d he gives Ive a blank check to rethink form factor without outside investo=
rs breathing down his neck.
On paper Ive becomes OpenAI=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Ccreative head=E2=80=9D for b=
oth hardware and software experience, reporting directly to Altman. In prac=
tice that means the same person who once decided how a phone should feel in=
 your palm now decides how GPT should manifest in your living room, on your=
 face, or wherever the team lands. The mandate is deliberately broad; insid=
ers say prototypes range from minimalist wristables to the widely rumored l=
ightweight glasses that ditch a screen in favor of continuous vision-and-vo=
ice interaction. Nothing ships until at least 2026, but the charter is clea=
r: own the object, own the moment of use, and let the model fade into the b=
ackground.
That=E2=80=99s the transaction in plain English=E2=80=94no venture theatric=
s, no design-studio mystique. A frontier-model lab is now, unequivocally, a=
 hardware company, and Jony Ive just became its chief storyteller in alumin=
um and glass. The question isn=E2=80=99t whether OpenAI can build devices; =
it=E2=80=99s whether controlling the physical interface will give it a moat=
 its software rivals can=E2=80=99t match. We=E2=80=99ll test that thesis in=
 the next sections.
Why the hardware play?
Apple is about to ship iOS 19 with its own on-device language models and a =
refreshed Siri SDK; Google just demoed Gemini-driven smart glasses under th=
e Project Moohan banner at I/O; Microsoft spent Build showing off multi-age=
nt Copilot PCs. Each of those moves does the same thing: it embeds someone =
else=E2=80=99s AI at the operating-system layer and leaves every third-part=
y model=E2=80=94OpenAI included=E2=80=94begging for API access on the incum=
bent=E2=80=99s terms. If Altman let that window close, ChatGPT would be rel=
egated to an app tile (and a 30 % revenue tax) on other people=E2=80=99s pl=
atforms. Buying Ive=E2=80=99s studio is a blunt way to break that dependenc=
y: ship a device, control distribution, harvest first-party usage data, and=
 keep the margin instead of paying rent to Cupertino or Mountain View.
But this isn=E2=80=99t just platform politics. Today=E2=80=99s GPT-4-class =
models beg for an interface that isn=E2=80=99t a bright rectangle filled wi=
th text bubbles. The leaks around io prototypes=E2=80=94screen-light, possi=
bly glasses-based, built for see-what-I-see context=E2=80=94hint at an inte=
raction model where the assistant watches what you=E2=80=99re looking at, w=
hispers in your ear, and vanishes when you don=E2=80=99t need it. That kind=
 of continuous, multimodal loop is impossible if the intelligence lives in =
the cloud and the UI lives on a phone that throttles microphone access afte=
r five seconds. Owning the industrial design lets Ive start from the constr=
aints of battery life, thermals, and low-latency edge inference instead of =
grafting AI onto hardware built for Instagram.
There=E2=80=99s a cost story here too. Cloud inference for a heavy-usage co=
nsumer assistant is brutally expensive; running tinier models on-device=E2=
=80=94or even partially on-device=E2=80=94slashes unit economics and round-=
trip latency. If OpenAI can pair its new Tiny-GPT family with silicon tuned=
 for eight-watt glasses, it can give users a real-time companion that feels=
 instantaneous and private while keeping gross margin above water. That=E2=
=80=99s a lever Apple and Google will also pull, but only for their own mod=
els. Vertical integration is the only way OpenAI gets the same privilege.
Finally, think where the next defensible moat forms. Model quality is conve=
rging; everyone will eventually license or train something =E2=80=9Cgood en=
ough.=E2=80=9D What doesn=E2=80=99t converge is behavioral data=E2=80=94the=
 messy stream of micro-interactions a device captures when it=E2=80=99s lit=
erally strapped to your face. Whoever owns the object owns that stream, and=
 whoever owns the stream trains the next generation of models. OpenAI just =
bought itself a seat at that table before the incumbents slam the door.
The consumer stack shake-up nobody=E2=80=99s talking about
Hardware grabs the headlines, but the quiet power-move is Fidji Simo=E2=80=
=99s pivot from Instacart to become OpenAI=E2=80=99s first-ever =E2=80=9CCE=
O of Applications.=E2=80=9D Simo has spent the last decade turning feed scr=
olls and grocery carts into muscle-memory habits=E2=80=94first at Facebook,=
 then at Instacart=E2=80=94and she is now charged with doing the same for C=
hatGPT. The hire matters because consumer AI is still, at heart, an engagem=
ent business: the model that wins is the one people open ten times a day wi=
thout thinking. Simo reports directly to Sam Altman, giving her a clear man=
date to make ChatGPT the default daily touchpoint before Ive=E2=80=99s hard=
ware even ships.
Her first step is consolidation. Right now OpenAI=E2=80=99s footprint is a =
sprawl of mobile apps, desktop clients, DALL=C2=B7E interfaces, and beta vo=
ice modes that don=E2=80=99t share sessions or billing. Simo=E2=80=99s like=
ly play is to collapse that mess into a single, identity-centric =E2=80=9CO=
penAI App,=E2=80=9D where one subscription unlocks text, image, voice, and =
whatever comes next. A unified surface does more than clean up UX; it gives=
 OpenAI a coherent data stream to train personalization and a ready-made lo=
gin for Ive=E2=80=99s rumored glasses. If the device pairs seamlessly the m=
oment you sign into the app, OpenAI sidesteps the cold-start friction that =
doomed so many wearables.
Second, commerce rails. Simo turned Instacart=E2=80=99s search box into an =
ad engine that sells everything from bananas to brand sponsorships. Expect =
her to test voice-initiated purchases (=E2=80=9CGrab those replacement filt=
ers I mentioned=E2=80=9D) and in-context upsells (premium DALL=C2=B7E style=
s, real-time tutoring, domain-specific agents) long before anyone pays for =
glasses. That diversifies revenue away from GPT-Plus subscriptions at the e=
xact moment inference costs are spiking. If she lands even a modest take-ra=
te on transactional spend, the unit economics of a hardware ecosystem look =
a lot less scary.
Finally, a real developer platform. Plug-ins have been awkward for end-user=
s and limited for builders. Simo is rumored to be scoping an Apps SDK that =
would let third-party services surface directly inside ChatGPT and project =
into any future device. Think 2010-era iPhone App Store, but with language =
instead of taps as the primary UI. That move both recruits outside innovati=
on and inoculates OpenAI against antitrust claims that it=E2=80=99s tying h=
ardware to a closed stack. If done right, it could draw the exact same long=
-tail developer energy that made Apple=E2=80=99s walled garden unstoppable=
=E2=80=94only this time, the garden is voice-first and potentially screen-l=
ess.
The net effect: Altman isn=E2=80=99t just buying design genius; he=E2=80=99=
s building a flywheel where app engagement feeds hardware adoption, and har=
dware sensors feed ever-smarter apps. If Simo nails daily habit before Ive=
=E2=80=99s device launches, the glasses will arrive to a user base already =
locked into OpenAI as muscle memory=E2=80=94turning a risky hardware debut =
into what looks, from the outside, like the next logical upgrade cycle.
Where this leaves the incumbents
Apple has spent the last year re-wiring iOS so that its own small language =
models can run entirely on device. Bloomberg says the iOS 19 SDK will give =
outside developers access to that stack, effectively letting every app call=
 Apple AI the way they call CoreML today. It=E2=80=99s a smart defensive mo=
ve, but it also means Siri gets first crack at the user=E2=80=99s question =
and ChatGPT becomes just another network call. Apple=E2=80=99s rumored ligh=
tweight glasses=E2=80=94internally code-named Quartz, I=E2=80=99m told=E2=
=80=94are still a prototype tucked behind Vision Pro, and they lack a publi=
c ship date. If OpenAI actually puts a GPT companion on your face before Ap=
ple does, Cupertino=E2=80=99s narrative of =E2=80=9Cprivacy-first, on-devic=
e AI=E2=80=9D starts to look like a catch-up story rather than a leap-frog.
Google is farther along in the glasses race. Project Moohan, revealed onsta=
ge at I/O, runs Gemini locally so the assistant can see what you see and an=
swer in real time. Google framed the device as an =E2=80=9CAndroid XR=E2=80=
=9D reference design and enlisted boutique eyewear brands to blunt the nerd=
-goggles stigma. Yet Google still has to appease hardware partners, so its =
own Pixel-grade execution tends to stall at =E2=80=9Cdeveloper kit=E2=80=9D=
 while Samsung, Oppo, and the rest debate margins. OpenAI, by contrast, can=
 move as a single-stack startup: one design language, one supply chain, one=
 software update cadence. If speed is the variable that matters, Google=E2=
=80=99s openness could morph from virtue to drag.
Meta owns the only AI glasses you can actually buy today. The Ray-Ban Meta =
frames do real-time translation and short photo captions, and reviewers pra=
ise the fashion-forward form factor. But the experience is still camera-fir=
st, not assistant-first, and once the novelty of POV video wears off the gl=
asses revert to Bluetooth shades. Meta will have to upgrade both the silico=
n and the conversational layer if it wants to keep early-mover advantage on=
ce a purpose-built GPT wearable shows up. The company=E2=80=99s stated road=
map is annual=E2=80=94not quarterly=E2=80=94iteration; I doubt that will ho=
ld users=E2=80=99 attention when they see continuous-vision GPT hitting the=
 market.
Amazon should feel the pressure most acutely. Alexa Plus was billed as the =
voice platform=E2=80=99s comeback, but even the friendliest reviewers compl=
ain about latency spikes and narrow domain coverage. If OpenAI can run a Ti=
ny-GPT variant locally, respond faster, and pull from ChatGPT=E2=80=99s ful=
l knowledge base, Echo=E2=80=99s main differentiation=E2=80=94price=E2=80=
=94looks thin. Amazon could license a frontier model, but that would conced=
e the brand halo it has chased since 2014. The safe bet is that Alexa doubl=
es down on home-automation niches and quietly cedes general reasoning to wh=
oever ships the best wearable.
Microsoft is the wild card. Redmond just introduced Copilot+ PCs and multi-=
agent orchestration at Build, and its stake in OpenAI means any Ive-designe=
d hardware could, in theory, show up on a Surface table the way Android onc=
e powered the Kindle. But there=E2=80=99s a knife-edge trade-off: if an Ope=
nAI OS ever competes directly with Windows, Satya Nadella will have to choo=
se between margin on PCs and upside on ChatGPT. For now the relationship is=
 symbiotic=E2=80=94Microsoft provides the edge silicon roadmap; OpenAI prov=
ides the flagship demo=E2=80=94but that d=C3=A9tente holds only as long as =
their platform ambitions don=E2=80=99t collide.
Put together, the field looks less like a five-horse sprint and more like a=
 timing puzzle: whoever can converge usable hardware, low-latency edge infe=
rence, and daily-habit software first will pull ahead while the rest haggle=
 over SDKs and component queues. OpenAI just tightened the race by collapsi=
ng those dependencies under one roof=E2=80=94and by poaching the designer w=
ho once taught the world to swipe.
The cliffs between PowerPoint and product
I=E2=80=99ve spent too many years watching gorgeous prototypes die in the c=
rawl from lab to loading dock. OpenAI now has barely eighteen months to tur=
n a pile of CNC-machined show-pieces (assuming those even exist) into a sup=
ply chain measured in millions of units. That means lining up custom optics=
, micro-OLED fabs, low-leakage batteries, and a logistics web that makes Ap=
ple=E2=80=99s look mundane=E2=80=94all while the world=E2=80=99s capacity f=
or advanced packaging is already booked by Vision Pro and a dozen XR preten=
ders. Ive has shipped at that scale before; OpenAI hasn=E2=80=99t. The delt=
a between those cultures is where hardware dreams usually bleed out.
Silicon is the second choke-point. A continuous-vision, whisper-quick assis=
tant can=E2=80=99t wait round-trip latency to a West Coast data center, nor=
 can it burn through battery like a first-gen VR headset. OpenAI will need =
a Tiny-GPT-class model that runs largely on-device and a custom SoC to matc=
h. Microsoft=E2=80=99s Copilot+ roadmap helps=E2=80=94Arm cores with dedica=
ted NPU lanes=E2=80=94but the glasses form factor demands orders-of-magnitu=
de tighter thermals. Either OpenAI burns capital on its own chip tape-out o=
r persuades Qualcomm/Samsung to hand over their best silicon before Apple g=
rabs the lot. Line-item dollars are less scary here than calendar time; mis=
s 2026 and the incumbents arrive first.
Given the state of the AI and device race, my rule of thumb is that a first=
-gen consumer gadget has to get into market within less than two years to m=
atter. OpenAI just started the clock.
What I=E2=80=99ll watch from here =E2=80=94 five markers that will tell us =
if this bet sticks
1. Deal-close mechanics (by August). Axios and Bloomberg both peg the trans=
action to close =E2=80=9Cthis summer,=E2=80=9D which means CFIUS and the FT=
C have at most three months to raise flags. If the paperwork sails through,=
 regulators are signaling they=E2=80=99ll tolerate vertical AI-hardware mer=
gers=E2=80=94at least for now. A delay or second-request review would fores=
hadow a much tougher path for any future OpenAI roll-ups.
2. OpenAI DevDay in November. Historically Altman uses DevDay to show unfin=
ished toys (last year: GPT-4o with voice). Watch for a glass-prototype teas=
er or, at minimum, a =E2=80=9Cdeveloper kit=E2=80=9D that lets partners sta=
rt building multimodal apps tailored to continuous vision. If nothing hardw=
are-ish appears, assume the supply-chain cliff is even steeper than expecte=
d.
3. Fidji Simo=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Csingle app=E2=80=9D moment. Simo starts th=
is summer; her first obvious win is collapsing ChatGPT, DALL=C2=B7E, and Vo=
ice Mode into one account-centric OpenAI App. A clean roll-out before year-=
end would prove she can align product, billing, and data pipelines=E2=80=94=
a prerequisite for seeding millions of future devices out of the gate and f=
or driving any kind of app network.
4. WWDC (June 9). Apple is expected to unveil on-device LLM tooling in iOS =
19. If it also flashes Quartz=E2=80=94the rumored lightweight Siri glasses=
=E2=80=94OpenAI=E2=80=99s time-to-market shrinks dramatically. If Apple sta=
ys silent on wearables, Jony and Sam=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cpost-phone=E2=80=9D=
 narrative gets a head start.
5. Prototype leak cadence. Bloomberg and Reuters say the first Ive/Altman p=
roducts are slated for 2026. I=E2=80=99m marking my calendar for a supply-c=
hain leak=E2=80=94FCC filings, component orders, anything concrete=E2=80=94=
by Q4 2025. No leaks means no factory lines, and no factory lines means vap=
orware.
If those checkpoints line up=E2=80=94regulators sign off, DevDay shows real=
 glass, the app unification lands cleanly, Apple holds fire, and parts star=
t moving through Shenzhen=E2=80=94then the marriage of GPT-grade brains and=
 Ive-grade hardware has a shot. Miss a few of these and this week=E2=80=99s=
 headlines age into another moon-shot press release (sort of like Sora).
My bottom line
I don=E2=80=99t buy the breathless =E2=80=9Cnext-iPhone=E2=80=9D headlines=
=E2=80=94yet. Hardware is a graveyard of well-financed optimism, and even a=
 design demigod can=E2=80=99t bend lithium-ion physics. But I do see a once=
-in-a-decade power play. OpenAI is yanking the interface layer out of Big T=
ech=E2=80=99s hands and betting that the marriage of a frontier model and a=
 purpose-built object can reset consumer expectations the way multitouch di=
d in 2007. If it works, we=E2=80=99ll stop talking about =E2=80=9Cusing Cha=
tGPT=E2=80=9D and start talking to an ambient companion that simply is, emb=
edded in whatever Ive ships next. That prospect should terrify every platfo=
rm owner that thought API rate limits were enough to fence in the model war=
s.
For the rest of us=E2=80=94builders, investors, pragmatists=E2=80=94the sig=
nal is clear: stop treating AI as another backend service and start asking =
where the interface itself wants to go. The companies that pair distributio=
n with differentiated human-machine touchpoints will win the adoption curve=
; everyone else will pay platform tax. Over the next few months I=E2=80=99l=
l be kicking around these expected milestones and watching Jony=E2=80=99s n=
ext move.=20
If OpenAI threads this needle, the age-old question =E2=80=9CWho owns the U=
I?=E2=80=9D finally has a new answer: whoever owns the relationship, and re=
lationship now starts with the hardware you barely notice=E2=80=94but can=
=E2=80=99t live without. We shall see!
