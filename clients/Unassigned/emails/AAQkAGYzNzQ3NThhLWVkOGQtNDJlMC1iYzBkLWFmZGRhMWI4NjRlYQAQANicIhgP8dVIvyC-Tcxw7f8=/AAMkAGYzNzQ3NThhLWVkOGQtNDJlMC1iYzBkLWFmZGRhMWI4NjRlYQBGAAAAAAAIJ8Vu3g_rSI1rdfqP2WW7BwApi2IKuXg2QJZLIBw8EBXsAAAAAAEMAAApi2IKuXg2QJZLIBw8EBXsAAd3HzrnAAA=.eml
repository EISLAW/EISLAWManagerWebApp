SAUDI ARABIA TAKING THE LEAD IN THE MIDDLE EAST [3]
RIYADH CAN’T ACHIEVE ITS REGIONAL OBJECTIVES WITHOUT SOME KIND OF ACCOMMODATION WITH ISRAEL.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
Massive geopolitical change has come to the Middle East. One of the region’s bigger powers, Iran, has been weakened by Israel, and the United States is in the process of overhauling its entire
foreign policy [4]. This state of affairs has given Saudi Arabia the opportunity to better influence its strategic environment, especially with regard to regional security architectures. But
Riyadh’s hand isn’t entirely free; it must take into account Israel and Turkey as it pursues its regional objectives. While Turkey poses a longer-term challenge, Israel represents the more
pressing matter.
[Saudi Arabia in the Middle East] [5]
_(click to enlarge)_ [6]
Several incidents this week suggest Saudi Arabia will soon have to engage with the latter. Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and the special envoy to Syria and Lebanon, said on Aug. 26 that
Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ready to fund an economic zone in southern Lebanon to provide alternative employment opportunities for Hezbollah members (provided they disarm, of course). The same day,
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan addressed an extraordinary session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza represent “the greatest
threat to security and peace in the region.” Meanwhile, the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing “strong disapproval and condemnation of the continuation of Israeli transgressions
and incursion inside Syrian territory.” One day earlier, the Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned a new “military incursion” by Israeli forces in the countryside southwest of Damascus after Syrian
President Ahmed al-Sharaa revealed that his government was in “advanced” talks with Israel on a security agreement.
All of this is the net result of roughly a year’s worth of upheaval in the Middle East. In that time, Hezbollah’s offensive military capabilities have been destroyed and many of its leaders
killed, the Assad regime in Syria has collapsed, and Israel has launched direct attacks on Iran. As a result, Tehran’s influence in the region is weaker than it has been in decades. Its degradation
has given Turkey a window to expand its influence south, especially in Syria, whose militia-turned-government Ankara overtly supports. (Notably, Turkish troops had already been deployed in Syria for a
decade.)
Saudi Arabia has benefitted similarly. Though it lacks the military capabilities of Turkey, Saudi Arabia is using its financial power to improve its position in the region. Last month, for example,
Riyadh pledged $6.4 billion in investment to Syria – a move made to prevent Turkey from simply replacing Iran as the dominant power in the Arab world. It knows full well Turkey is too financially
strapped to compete with it in this regard.
But the kingdom is not simply trying to contain Turkey. Rather, it sees a historic opportunity to push back against the regional status quo that has been in place for decades, in which non-Arab powers
have vied for control of the Arab world. Riyadh understands that it will need to parlay its economic clout into more substantial military power. That goal is a long way off.
In some ways, it never had to worry too much about its military. Shortly before the end of World War II, Saudi Arabia decided to rely on the U.S. as a security guarantor. Thus was their arrangement
throughout the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the 9/11 attacks, the wars they triggered in the Middle East, and the Arab Spring uprisings all led to the gradual diminishing of U.S.
support for the kingdom. This explains why, in the 2010s, Saudi Arabia acted alone in quelling the uprising in Bahrain and in attacking Houthi rebels in Yemen. It succeeded in Bahrain but failed in
Yemen.
Yemen was a mixed blessing, for in its failure, Saudi Arabia gained valuable battlefield experience it had never had before. The bigger issue is that the U.S., under the Trump administration, is
trying to reduce its exposure to global insecurity. Its new strategy, then, is to have allied and partner nations take the lead in security responsibility for their respective regions.
In the Middle East, Turkey is the obvious choice. But it isn’t the only choice. Hence why the Trump administration has deliberately sought to upgrade the geopolitical status of Saudi Arabia. Instead
of reacting to waning U.S. support, Riyadh is now positioning itself in what has emerged as the new American global security doctrine. And it is acting accordingly – including by investing in Syria
and engaging with a government run by a group formerly a franchise of al-Qaida.
Saudi involvement won’t stop there. Washington wants Riyadh to take the lead in managing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially once the fighting in Gaza comes to an end. Washington’s
pressure aside, the Saudi government realizes that if it fails to take on this responsibility, it cannot hope to shape the future of the Arab world. President Donald Trump’s framework for this is
the Abraham Accords, which Riyadh had hoped to sign on to – that is, until the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas torpedoed the efforts. The military response in Gaza has made it difficult for the kingdom to
engage with Israel.
While it is unlikely to fully normalize relations with Israel anytime soon, Saudi Arabia will have to engage with it on security and governance in Gaza once the fighting ends. Such diplomatic
engagements will not be limited to the strip; they will also involve the future status of the West Bank. The future of the Palestinian Territories has a direct effect on the stability of Egypt and
Jordan, which is a major concern for the kingdom’s soon-to-be-monarch, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. MBS wants to ensure that Hezbollah is kept in check in Lebanon. This requires Riyadh also to
deal with Israel, which has a large military presence in the country’s south. In short, if Saudi Arabia wants to stabilize the Arab world, it will have to find some kind of accommodation with
Israel.

 objectives. While Turkey poses a longer-term challenge, Israel represents =
the more pressing matter.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Several incidents =
this week suggest Saudi Arabia will soon have to engage with the latter. To=
m Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and the special envoy to Syria and=
 Lebanon, said on Aug. 26 that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ready to fund an =
economic zone in southern Lebanon to provide alternative employment opportu=
nities for Hezbollah members (provided they disarm, of course). The same da=
y, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan addressed an extraordina=
ry session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah, saying Isr=
ael=E2=80=99s actions in Gaza represent =E2=80=9Cthe greatest threat to sec=
urity and peace in the region.=E2=80=9D Meanwhile, the Saudi Foreign Minist=
ry issued a statement expressing =E2=80=9Cstrong disapproval and condemnati=
on of the continuation of Israeli transgressions and incursion inside Syria=
n territory.=E2=80=9D One day earlier, the Syrian Foreign Ministry condemne=
d a new =E2=80=9Cmilitary incursion=E2=80=9D by Israeli forces in the count=
ryside southwest of Damascus after Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa reveale=
d that his government was in =E2=80=9Cadvanced=E2=80=9D talks with Israel o=
n a security agreement.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">All of this is the=
 net result of roughly a year=E2=80=99s worth of upheaval in the Middle Eas=
t. In that time, Hezbollah=E2=80=99s offensive military capabilities have b=
een destroyed and many of its leaders killed, the Assad regime in Syria has=
 collapsed, and Israel has launched direct attacks on Iran. As a result, Te=
hran=E2=80=99s influence in the region is weaker than it has been in decade=
s. Its degradation has given Turkey a window to expand its influence south,=
 especially in Syria, whose militia-turned-government Ankara overtly suppor=
ts. (Notably, Turkish troops had already been deployed in Syria for a decad=
e.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Saudi Arabia has b=
enefitted similarly. Though it lacks the military capabilities of Turkey, S=
audi Arabia is using its financial power to improve its position in the reg=
ion. Last month, for example, Riyadh pledged $6.4 billion in investment to =
Syria =E2=80=93 a move made to prevent Turkey from simply replacing Iran as=
 the dominant power in the Arab world. It knows full well Turkey is too fin=
ancially strapped to compete with it in this regard.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But the kingdom is=
 not simply trying to contain Turkey. Rather, it sees a historic opportunit=
y to push back against the regional status quo that has been in place for d=
ecades, in which non-Arab powers have vied for control of the Arab world. R=
iyadh understands that it will need to parlay its economic clout into more =
substantial military power. That goal is a long way off.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In some ways, it n=
ever had to worry too much about its military. Shortly before the end of Wo=
rld War II, Saudi Arabia decided to rely on the U.S. as a security guaranto=
r. Thus was their arrangement throughout the Cold War. The collapse of the =
Soviet Union, the 9/11 attacks, the wars they triggered in the Middle East,=
 and the Arab Spring uprisings all led to the gradual diminishing of U.S. s=
upport for the kingdom. This explains why, in the 2010s, Saudi Arabia acted=
 alone in quelling the uprising in Bahrain and in attacking Houthi rebels i=
n Yemen. It succeeded in Bahrain but failed in Yemen.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Yemen was a mixed =
blessing, for in its failure, Saudi Arabia gained valuable battlefield expe=
rience it had never had before. The bigger issue is that the U.S., under th=
e Trump administration, is trying to reduce its exposure to global insecuri=
ty. Its new strategy, then, is to have allied and partner nations take the =
lead in security responsibility for their respective regions.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the Middle East=
, Turkey is the obvious choice. But it isn=E2=80=99t the only choice. Hence=
 why the Trump administration has deliberately sought to upgrade the geopol=
itical status of Saudi Arabia. Instead of reacting to waning U.S. support, =
Riyadh is now positioning itself in what has emerged as the new American gl=
obal security doctrine. And it is acting accordingly =E2=80=93 including by=
 investing in Syria and engaging with a government run by a group formerly =
a franchise of al-Qaida.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Saudi involvement =
won=E2=80=99t stop there. Washington wants Riyadh to take the lead in manag=
ing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially once the fighting in Gaza =
comes to an end. Washington=E2=80=99s pressure aside, the Saudi government =
realizes that if it fails to take on this responsibility, it cannot hope to=
 shape the future of the Arab world. President Donald Trump=E2=80=99s frame=
work for this is the Abraham Accords, which Riyadh had hoped to sign on to =
=E2=80=93 that is, until the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas torpedoed the efforts.=
 The military response in Gaza has made it difficult for the kingdom to eng=
age with Israel.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">While it is unlike=
ly to fully normalize relations with Israel anytime soon, Saudi Arabia will=
 have to engage with it on security and governance in Gaza once the fightin=
g ends. Such diplomatic engagements will not be limited to the strip; they =
will also involve the future status of the West Bank. The future of the Pal=
estinian Territories has a direct effect on the stability of Egypt and Jord=
an, which is a major concern for the kingdom=E2=80=99s soon-to-be-monarch, =
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. MBS wants to ensure that Hezbollah is kep=
t in check in Lebanon. This requires Riyadh also to deal with Israel, which=
 has a large military presence in the country=E2=80=99s south. In short, if=
 Saudi Arabia wants to stabilize the Arab world, it will have to find some =
kind of accommodation with Israel.</p>
