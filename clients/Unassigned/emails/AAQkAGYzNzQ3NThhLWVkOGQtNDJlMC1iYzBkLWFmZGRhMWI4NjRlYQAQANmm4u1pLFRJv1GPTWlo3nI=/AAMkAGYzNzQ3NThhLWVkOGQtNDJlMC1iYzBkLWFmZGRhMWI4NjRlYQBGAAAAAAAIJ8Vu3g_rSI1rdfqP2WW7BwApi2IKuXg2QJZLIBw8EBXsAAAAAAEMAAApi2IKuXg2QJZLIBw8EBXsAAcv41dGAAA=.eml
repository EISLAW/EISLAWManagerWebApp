INDIA, PAKISTAN, DIPLOMACY AND WAR [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
Clashes broke out last week between Pakistan and India after a militant group – purportedly backed by Pakistan – attacked an India-controlled area of Kashmir. These kinds of affairs are common,
especially for historic rivals who share a border, but the nature of this particular conflict illustrates recent changes in how diplomacy and militaries operate.
The “normal” response to a massacre of Indians by a force originating in Pakistan would have resulted in the massing of troops on both sides of the border, followed by small skirmishes carried out
by small units of infantry. Light artillery could have been added to the mix, and it’s possible that more forces would have been deployed some distance behind the border, the size of which would
telegraph the potential threat.
A process like this is an essential dimension of diplomacy. A border clash suggests that a larger attack might be possible if diplomacy fails. It is a tool diplomats use to convince the other side
that their country has not been intimidated and that the failure to settle the issue diplomatically could lead to war. Whether this is a serious threat or an empty gesture could be inferred from the
severity of the border clash and the number of soldiers being sent to the rear. It's a ritual that sometimes leads to settlement, sometimes leads to war, sometimes marginalizes the underlying issue,
sometimes recurs, and sometimes serves as nothing more than an intimidation technique. Regardless of how frequently it occurs, it is not so much a military threat as a diplomatic signal.
The encounter between India and Pakistan was not a border clash but served the same purpose. It involved an intrusion of aircraft into another country’s airspace. Thus, diplomatic military signals
were delivered by drones aimed at military targets far beyond the border and bases close to certain towns and cities. Both sides gave diplomatic signals; they just did so in a radically new way. They
ignored the border to deliver the signal and initiated with what had once been a signal of all-out war.
Until recently, the border had represented in conventional war the distinction between sovereignty and the violation of sovereignty – that is, the end of diplomacy and the beginning of war.
Diplomatic messages were delivered by both sides, just not at the border. The episode last week, then, is not an idiosyncratic event; it’s a profound evolution of military gestures as part of
diplomacy, one that reflects a change in the nature of war and the relative irrelevance of borders. The key element is in the development of drones. They are the offspring of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. The ICBM is a strategic weapon. The drone is a small missile that contains explosives but is itself explosive, a cross between an artillery shell and an ICBM – not necessarily
ballistic but potentially maneuverable in flight. Long-range ICBMs were not a suitable warning. Drones, with their less destructive potential and more limited impact, were.
As important, just as ICBMs changed the nature of strategic warfare, drones have, in concert with sensor satellites, changed the nature of tactical warfare. This shift has been on full display in
Ukraine. Drones have not simply been used as weapons of terror pointed at civilian assets, as ICBMs are. They have also been used to strike at and defeat small and larger conventional warfare
elements: troops, tanks, fortifications, communications, logistics hubs and any other element of war.
In one sense, they function as long-range artillery shells. In another, they function as aircraft in their own right, increasingly able to maneuver and escape anti-drone missiles. And in yet another
sense, they reshape conventional warfare. In Ukraine, Russian offensive operations massed troops, armor and artillery for warfare in a model comparable to those of World War II. The U.S. used
satellites with multispectral sensors that could “see” and detect the presence of these troops from body heat, metal and various other spectra. What had been ground-to-ground warfare became air
power, which has now turned into satellite-based targeting of ground-based drones. The impact this has had on warfare notwithstanding, it has fundamentally changed the ways countries can deliver
diplomatic threats. It has also made borders more symbolic than sacrosanct.
The most dramatic change – and this isn’t especially new – is the space-based targeting of agile missiles designed to survive long enough to reach their target. This means that the deployment of
ground forces must be rethought, and that conventional warfare – the foundation of both national security and aggression – will heavily shift to air power. If every drone serves as an aircraft and
bomb at the same time, used once and thrown away, there must emerge survivable munitions carrying submunitions also targeted from low Earth orbit.
Thus, in the wake of the Ukraine war, the India-Pakistan episode indicates that border clashes as gestures are to some extent obsolete, that drone advances as gestures are far more dangerous than
border clashes, and that tactical warfare has changed profoundly.

														</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Clashes broke out =
last week between Pakistan and India after a militant group =E2=80=93 purpo=
rtedly backed by Pakistan =E2=80=93 attacked an India-controlled area of Ka=
shmir. These kinds of affairs are common, especially for historic rivals wh=
o share a border, but the nature of this particular conflict illustrates re=
cent changes in how diplomacy and militaries operate.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The =E2=80=9Cnorma=
l=E2=80=9D response to a massacre of Indians by a force originating in Paki=
stan would have resulted in the massing of troops on both sides of the bord=
er, followed by small skirmishes carried out by small units of infantry. Li=
ght artillery could have been added to the mix, and it=E2=80=99s possible t=
hat more forces would have been deployed some distance behind the border, t=
he size of which would telegraph the potential threat.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A process like thi=
s is an essential dimension of diplomacy. A border clash suggests that a la=
rger attack might be possible if diplomacy fails. It is a tool diplomats us=
e to convince the other side that their country has not been intimidated an=
d that the failure to settle the issue diplomatically could lead to war. Wh=
ether this is a serious threat or an empty gesture could be inferred from t=
he severity of the border clash and the number of soldiers being sent to th=
e rear. It's a ritual that sometimes leads to settlement, sometimes leads t=
o war, sometimes marginalizes the underlying issue, sometimes recurs, and s=
ometimes serves as nothing more than an intimidation technique. Regardless =
of how frequently it occurs, it is not so much a military threat as a diplo=
matic signal.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The encounter betw=
een India and Pakistan was not a border clash but served the same purpose. =
It involved an intrusion of aircraft into another country=E2=80=99s airspac=
e. Thus, diplomatic military signals were delivered by drones aimed at mili=
tary targets far beyond the border and bases close to certain towns and cit=
ies. Both sides gave diplomatic signals; they just did so in a radically ne=
w way. They ignored the border to deliver the signal and initiated with wha=
t had once been a signal of all-out war.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Until recently, th=
e border had represented in conventional war the distinction between sovere=
ignty and the violation of sovereignty =E2=80=93 that is, the end of diplom=
acy and the beginning of war. Diplomatic messages were delivered by both si=
des, just not at the border. The episode last week, then, is not an idiosyn=
cratic event; it=E2=80=99s a profound evolution of military gestures as par=
t of diplomacy, one that reflects a change in the nature of war and the rel=
ative irrelevance of borders. The key element is in the development of dron=
es. They are the offspring of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The ICBM=
 is a strategic weapon. The drone is a small missile that contains explosiv=
es but is itself explosive, a cross between an artillery shell and an ICBM =
=E2=80=93 not necessarily ballistic but potentially maneuverable in flight.=
 Long-range ICBMs were not a suitable warning. Drones, with their less dest=
ructive potential and more limited impact, were.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">As important, just=
 as ICBMs changed the nature of strategic warfare, drones have, in concert =
with sensor satellites, changed the nature of tactical warfare. This shift =
has been on full display in Ukraine. Drones have not simply been used as we=
apons of terror pointed at civilian assets, as ICBMs are. They have also be=
en used to strike at and defeat small and larger conventional warfare eleme=
nts: troops, tanks, fortifications, communications, logistics hubs and any =
other element of war.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In one sense, they=
 function as long-range artillery shells. In another, they function as airc=
raft in their own right, increasingly able to maneuver and escape anti-dron=
e missiles. And in yet another sense, they reshape conventional warfare. In=
 Ukraine, Russian offensive operations massed troops, armor and artillery f=
or warfare in a model comparable to those of World War II. The U.S. used sa=
tellites with multispectral sensors that could =E2=80=9Csee=E2=80=9D and de=
tect the presence of these troops from body heat, metal and various other s=
pectra. What had been ground-to-ground warfare became air power, which has =
now turned into satellite-based targeting of ground-based drones. The impac=
t this has had on warfare notwithstanding, it has fundamentally changed the=
 ways countries can deliver diplomatic threats. It has also made borders mo=
re symbolic than sacrosanct.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The most dramatic =
change =E2=80=93 and this isn=E2=80=99t especially new =E2=80=93 is the spa=
ce-based targeting of agile missiles designed to survive long enough to rea=
ch their target. This means that the deployment of ground forces must be re=
thought, and that conventional warfare =E2=80=93 the foundation of both nat=
ional security and aggression =E2=80=93 will heavily shift to air power. If=
 every drone serves as an aircraft and bomb at the same time, used once and=
 thrown away, there must emerge survivable munitions carrying submunitions =
also targeted from low Earth orbit.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Thus, in the wake =
of the Ukraine war, the India-Pakistan episode indicates that border clashe=
s as gestures are to some extent obsolete, that drone advances as gestures =
are far more dangerous than border clashes, and that tactical warfare has c=
hanged profoundly.</p>
