This week in AI was nuts.=20
OpenAI launched a browser.=20
Meta laid off 600+ very smart people in their AI division (OpenAI snapped a=
 bunch of them up).
Anthropic just cooked up a deal with Google to get them out of their comput=
e bottleneck.
And none of those are the most interesting story of the week! That belongs =
to Citigroup and their big reveal that AI agents are already saving them 50=
 developer YEARS per WEEK.=20
You read that right. I dug into how companies like Citigroup get insane num=
bers like that with AI, plus the implications for all of us wrestling with =
building AI agents.
I also put together a prompt for this week=E2=80=99s news so you could figu=
re out how it applies to you, specifically, in like 5 minutes.
Plus I grabbed a few other stories that really mattered, including Apple la=
unching AI-native silicon (LOL when will they launch a real model though).
Dig in with the coffee and have fun!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Grab this week=E2=80=99s news prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/b9c652=

Most AI news analysis stops at =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s what happened=E2=80=
=9D and leaves you to figure out what it means for your work. That=E2=80=99=
s not helpful. This prompt gives you a way to actually think through these =
six developments in the context of your specific business, role, and priori=
ties. Copy it into Claude or ChatGPT, answer a few questions about your sit=
uation, and you=E2=80=99ll get analysis that cuts through the noise to focu=
s on what actually matters for you. It=E2=80=99s designed to move you from =
=E2=80=9Cinteresting news=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s what I should=
 do about it=E2=80=9D in one conversation.
Six Stories That Mattered This Week in AI
This week showed us where the AI industry is heading and where it=E2=80=99s=
 vulnerable. We=E2=80=99re seeing major platform shifts as OpenAI and other=
s move from chat interfaces to controlling how users access the web. We=E2=
=80=99re watching new architectural patterns emerge that change how we thin=
k about prompting and agent capabilities.=20
We=E2=80=99re seeing hardware-software integration accelerate in ways that =
could reshape where AI computation happens. And we=E2=80=99re confronting t=
he reality that the security models we=E2=80=99ve relied on don=E2=80=99t w=
ork for AI-native applications.
Meanwhile, enterprises are starting to publish real numbers on AI productiv=
ity gains=E2=80=94but only when they=E2=80=99re willing to invest what it t=
akes. And competitive dynamics are forcing even well-resourced companies to=
 question whether their strategies are working.
These six stories matter because they=E2=80=99re not isolated developments.=
 They=E2=80=99re interconnected pieces of how AI infrastructure, enterprise=
 adoption, and product strategy are evolving right now. Let=E2=80=99s dig i=
n.
Top 6 AI News Stories for Builders: October 19-24, 2025
Story 1: OpenAI Launches Atlas Browser
What happened:
OpenAI launched Atlas on October 21, an AI-powered web browser that directl=
y competes with Chrome, Safari, and Edge. Atlas has no traditional address =
bar=E2=80=94users enter URLs through ChatGPT=E2=80=99s chat interface, maki=
ng the chatbot the primary gateway to the web.=20
The browser includes =E2=80=9Cagent mode=E2=80=9D (experimental, Plus/Pro o=
nly) that can perform tasks on users=E2=80=99 behalf, such as interacting w=
ith word processors and online grocery platforms. Currently macOS-only with=
 Windows, iOS, and Android versions planned. With ChatGPT=E2=80=99s 800 mil=
lion weekly active users, Atlas positions OpenAI to control more of the sea=
rch and browsing experience while collecting user data to improve future AI=
 models.
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
OpenAI: Launched Atlas as part of a strategy shift from chatbot to full int=
ernet platform, CEO Sam Altman described it as =E2=80=9Ca once-in-a-decade =
chance to redefine the concept of a browser=E2=80=9D
Perplexity: Launched competing Comet browser with similar AI-native feature=
s around the same time
Builders: Gain access to AI-first browsing primitives, though face new secu=
rity challenges
Google, Apple, Microsoft: Face new competition in browser market share from=
 AI-native entrants
Why it matters:
Platform consolidation: OpenAI transitions from AI service provider to inte=
rnet infrastructure layer, similar to Google=E2=80=99s Chrome strategy a de=
cade ago
Data control: Eliminates need for competing search engines, allowing OpenAI=
 to directly collect browsing data for model training
Developer ecosystem shift: AI-native browsers create new UX paradigms and i=
ntegration points for builders
Competition catalyst: Triggered similar moves from Perplexity and forced in=
cumbents to accelerate AI browser features
What to watch:
Adoption rates among ChatGPT=E2=80=99s massive user base, whether Atlas can=
 achieve meaningful browser market share against Chrome=E2=80=99s dominance=
, security and privacy implementations, and how quickly Google/Microsoft re=
spond with AI-native browser features. The New York Times lawsuit against O=
penAI over copyright violations adds legal uncertainty to the browser=E2=80=
=99s future.
Story 2: Anthropic Agent Skills Launch
What happened:
Anthropic launched Agent Skills on October 16, a modular system allowing de=
velopers to package reusable workflows, scripts, and domain expertise into =
folders that Claude can dynamically load and compose.=20
Skills are composable (multiple skills work together automatically), portab=
le (same format across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API), efficient (progres=
sive disclosure loads only relevant context), and available for Pro, Max, T=
eam, and Enterprise plans with code execution enabled. Early enterprise ado=
pters include Box, Rakuten, and Canva. The system uses progressive disclosu=
re to manage context efficiently rather than loading everything upfront.
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
Anthropic: Shipped Skills alongside existing Claude capabilities, positioni=
ng it as =E2=80=9Cmaybe a bigger deal than MCP=E2=80=9D per Simon Willison
Enterprise customers: Box, Rakuten, Canva adopting Skills for workflow auto=
mation; Salesforce integrated Claude within trust boundary; Deloitte rollin=
g out to 470,000+ professionals
Developers: Can now create portable, reusable agent capabilities without re=
building from scratch
Competing labs: OpenAI=E2=80=99s AgentKit and Google=E2=80=99s agent framew=
orks face comparison with Skills=E2=80=99 composability
Why it matters:
Workflow portability: Skills work across Claude.ai, Claude Code (IDE), and =
API, eliminating platform lock-in
Enterprise adoption: Major deployments (Deloitte 470k users, Salesforce int=
egration) validate enterprise readiness
Composability advantage: Multiple skills automatically work together vs sin=
gle-purpose tools requiring manual orchestration
Context efficiency: Progressive disclosure solves token limit constraints t=
hat plague other agent frameworks
What to watch:
Developer creation of third-party Skills marketplace (very strong so far), =
enterprise adoption rates vs custom agent solutions, performance comparison=
s with OpenAI=E2=80=99s AgentKit and tool-calling APIs, and whether Skills =
becomes the standard format for agent capabilities.
Story 3: Apple M5 Chip Launch
What happened:
Apple released M5-powered MacBook Pro and iPad Pro models available startin=
g October 22. The M5 chip delivers over 4x peak GPU compute performance for=
 AI compared to M4, with Neural Accelerators embedded in each GPU core for =
on-device AI workloads, up to 3.5x faster AI performance for workflows, a 1=
6-core Neural Engine for faster LLM inference, and 30% faster graphics perf=
ormance.=20
MacBook Pro offers up to 24 hours battery life. The M5 represents Apple=E2=
=80=99s most significant AI hardware leap, positioning Mac/iPad as serious =
platforms for local AI development and inference.
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
Apple: Shipped M5 across MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Vision Pro product line=
s
Developers: Gain access to significantly faster on-device AI capabilities f=
or app development
AI builders: Can now run larger models locally with better performance/watt=
 than cloud alternatives
Enterprise buyers: Face decision between M5=E2=80=99s local AI advantages v=
s cloud-based workflows
Why it matters:
On-device AI viability: 4x AI compute makes local LLM inference practical f=
or many use cases, reducing cloud dependencies
Privacy advantage: Local processing enables AI features without sending dat=
a to cloud providers
Cost structure shift: High upfront hardware cost but zero ongoing inference=
 costs vs cloud pricing
Ecosystem lock-in: Apple=E2=80=99s integrated hardware/software advantages =
create moat against Windows/Linux AI development
What to watch:
Real-world benchmarks of M5 running popular AI models (Llama, Mistral, etc.=
), developer adoption for building M5-optimized AI apps, battery life under=
 sustained AI workloads, and whether local inference becomes competitive wi=
th cloud for production use cases.
Story 4: AI Browser Security Crisis
What happened:
Security researchers uncovered critical vulnerabilities across multiple AI-=
native browsers in October 2025, exposing fundamental security flaws in how=
 AI browsers handle the boundary between user commands and untrusted web co=
ntent.=20
Perplexity=E2=80=99s Comet browser faced two major disclosures:=20
Brave researchers (October 21) discovered prompt injection via screenshots=
=E2=80=94hidden text (faint blue on yellow background, invisible to humans)=
 extracted via OCR when users screenshot pages can inject malicious command=
s directly to AI.=20
LayerX researchers (October 4) found =E2=80=9CCometJacking=E2=80=9D (CVE-20=
25-62353, CVSS 8.6 High)=E2=80=94crafted URLs force Comet to read from memo=
ry (emails, calendar, contacts), encode results (e.g., base64), and POST to=
 attacker-controlled endpoints.=20
Windsurf coding IDE disclosed path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-62353)=
 on October 16 allowing arbitrary filesystem access through AI file tools. =
Security researchers noted similar vulnerabilities exist in other agentic b=
rowsers including Fellou, suggesting this is a systemic industry problem af=
fecting OpenAI=E2=80=99s Atlas and other AI-native browsers.
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
Perplexity: Launched Comet to =E2=80=9Cmillions=E2=80=9D on waitlist while =
dealing with critical security disclosures; made browser free for all users=
 October 2 (previously $200/month)
OpenAI: Just launched Atlas browser October 21, likely faces similar securi=
ty challenges given shared architecture
Brave, LayerX, security researchers: Disclosed vulnerabilities responsibly,=
 highlighting fundamental AI browser security gaps
Windsurf/Codeium: Addressed path traversal vulnerability in AI coding envir=
onment
Users: Anyone using AI browsers for sensitive tasks (banking, email, coding=
) at risk of data exfiltration
Browser Company (Dia), other AI browser startups: Face same fundamental sec=
urity design challenges
Why it matters:
Systemic architecture flaw: AI browsers fundamentally struggle to separate =
user intent from malicious web content, unlike traditional browsers with cl=
ear same-origin policies
Same-origin bypass: Vulnerabilities completely circumvent traditional web s=
ecurity protections that have evolved over 25+ years
Timing risk: Atlas launched into market while Comet vulnerabilities were be=
ing disclosed, suggesting OpenAI may face similar issues
Adoption at scale: Perplexity made Comet free for millions of users before =
security issues were resolved, maximizing potential harm
Trust crisis: Early AI browser security failures could delay mainstream ado=
ption and create regulatory pressure
Developer implications: Builders integrating with AI browsers or building a=
gentic features need new security frameworks
What to watch:
Whether OpenAI=E2=80=99s Atlas discloses similar vulnerabilities in coming =
weeks, Perplexity=E2=80=99s patch effectiveness and timeline, development o=
f AI browser security standards and best practices, regulatory responses to=
 AI browser vulnerabilities, whether traditional browser vendors (Chrome, S=
afari, Edge) use security concerns to slow AI browser competition, and emer=
gence of security-focused AI browser alternatives.
Story 5: Citigroup AI Productivity Gains
What happened:
Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser revealed on October 14 earnings call that AI depl=
oyment frees up 100,000 hours of developer time per week (equivalent to add=
ing ~50 full-time developers annually per week saved). Nearly 180,000 emplo=
yees in 83 countries have access to Citi=E2=80=99s internal AI tools (Citi =
Assist, Citi Stylus, Citi Squad).=20
September launch: agentic AI pilot for 5,000 employees using Google Cloud G=
emini and Anthropic Claude models to complete multi-step tasks with single =
prompt.=20
Citi Stylus Workspaces now uses agentic AI integrated with various systems.=
=20
Employees entered 6.5 million+ prompts in first part of 2025. Company manda=
ted AI prompt training (=E2=80=9DAsking Smart Questions=E2=80=9D) for 175,0=
00 employees in September. 384 applications retired or replaced so far in 2=
025.
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
Citigroup: ~40,000 developers globally gaining 100,000 weekly hours through=
 AI tools
Google Cloud: Partnership providing Gemini models and Vertex AI infrastruct=
ure
Anthropic: Claude models integrated into Citi=E2=80=99s platforms
Employees: 180,000 users with AI access, 175,000 completed mandatory prompt=
 training
Why it matters:
Quantified impact: 100,000 hours/week =3D clear ROI metric for enterprise A=
I adoption
Scale demonstration: Deployment across 180,000 employees in 83 countries pr=
oves enterprise AI viability
Agentic evolution: Move from assistive AI to autonomous multi-step agents r=
epresents next adoption phase
Workforce transformation: Mandatory prompt training signals AI literacy as =
core business skill
What to watch:
More results from 5,000-employee agentic AI pilot, 2026 investor day announ=
cements on expanded AI transformation, whether other banks match Citigroup=
=E2=80=99s productivity gains (JP Morgan has already announced similar impa=
ct), and impact on hiring/workforce planning.
How did Citi do this? There are no shorcuts. The way these big numbers get =
delivered is by diving in on the hard stuff around AI agents: context handl=
ing, graceful fallbacks, how we think about multi-agent conflict resolution=
=2E Step-by-step work task handling for=
 agents with working memory. Establish=
ing agentic decision scopes. And of course, evals (whatever anybody says). =
That=E2=80=99s the kind of work you need to do get Citi-scale results.
Bottom line: AI agents that work are a function of architecture right now, =
not models. And few want to do the work of building architecture that=E2=80=
=99s required to harvest non-linear gains like this. For many organizations=
, blaming the models for their own failure to correctly construct agentic A=
I systems is easier!
Story 6: Meta AI Layoffs
What happened:
Meta announced on October 22 that it will lay off approximately 600 positio=
ns within its AI division to =E2=80=9Cstreamline operations and enhance eff=
iciency.=E2=80=9D The cuts affect Meta=E2=80=99s AI infrastructure includin=
g FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) and product-related roles, but exclude TBD=
 Labs (high-profile AI recruits under Alexandr Wang).=20
The announcement came in a memo from Wang, Meta=E2=80=99s chief AI officer =
who joined in June as part of Meta=E2=80=99s $14.4 billion investment in Sc=
ale AI. Meta created Superintelligence Labs (led by Wang and former GitHub =
CEO Nat Friedman) following tepid reception to Llama 4 in April.=20
Who=E2=80=99s involved:
Meta: Restructuring AI division under Wang=E2=80=99s leadership, total Supe=
rintelligence Labs now under 3,000 employees
Alexandr Wang (Scale AI): Leading Meta=E2=80=99s AI direction as Chief AI O=
fficer
Affected employees: 600 staff from FAIR and AI infrastructure teams given s=
everance packages
CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Expressed dissatisfaction with Llama 4 progress, drivi=
ng reorganization
Why it matters:
Strategic shift: Meta protecting high-value recruits in TBD Labs while cutt=
ing existing teams signals confidence in new hires over incumbents
Resource competition: Internal teams competing for GPU compute; layoffs con=
solidate resources under Wang=E2=80=99s control
Competitive pressure: Meta racing to catch OpenAI/Anthropic after Llama 4 d=
isappointment
Expense trajectory: Meta projects 2026 expense growth rate exceeding 2025, =
signaling continued AI investment despite cuts
What to watch:
Llama 5 performance and reception, whether TBD Labs delivers breakthrough c=
apabilities justifying restructuring, impact on Meta=E2=80=99s open-source =
AI strategy, and morale effects from protecting new hires while cutting vet=
erans.
Honestly, the biggest elephant in the room is this: Can Zuck catch up? It=
=E2=80=99s unclear. At the moment, it looks like his issue isn=E2=80=99t ta=
lent. It=E2=80=99s strategy.
HOT OFF THE PRESSES=E2=80=94Anthropic-Google Deal
On October 23, 2025, Anthropic announced a historic, multi-billion-dollar e=
xpansion of its partnership with Google Cloud, committing tens of billions =
of dollars to access Google=E2=80=99s latest TPU infrastructure for trainin=
g future Claude models. This move sharply lowers barriers to entry by democ=
ratizing frontier compute capacity, fueling fierce competition with OpenAI=
=E2=80=99s reliance on Nvidia GPUs and Azure infrastructure.
By enabling access to Google=E2=80=99s scalable, purpose-built AI chips, th=
is deal aims to break the traditional compute bottlenecks faced in both tra=
ining and serving large language models, potentially ushering in a new era =
of more accessible, less congested AI model deployment.
For Anthropic, this means greater flexibility to rapidly iterate on larger,=
 more sophisticated models. For the industry, it signals a pivotal shift to=
ward open, diversified compute ecosystems that could diminish dominance of =
heavyweight hardware providers and usher in an era of more competitive, sca=
lable model serving.
Bonus Note: The Memory and Knowledge Launches
Both Anthropic and OpenAI launched major features focused around memory and=
 company knowledge this week. I tested them. They are fairly recency-focuse=
d and fairly narrowly scoped in what they can search. They still represent =
a move in the direction that model makers want to go. I would expect to see=
 much more significant releases here=E2=80=94behind the scenes, quietly ext=
ending the capabilities and the connections they can make to data in coming=
 months.
This is infrastructure work. The initial releases are modest, but the archi=
tecture they=E2=80=99re building matters more than the current feature set.=

20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">On October =
23, 2025, Anthropic announced a historic, multi-billion-dollar expansion of=
 its partnership with Google Cloud, committing tens of billions of dollars =
to access Google=E2=80=99s latest TPU infrastructure for training future Cl=
aude models. This move sharply lowers barriers to entry by democratizing fr=
ontier compute capacity, fueling fierce competition with OpenAI=E2=80=99s r=
eliance on Nvidia GPUs and Azure infrastructure.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=

ms to break the traditional compute bottlenecks faced in both training and =
serving large language models, potentially ushering in a new era of more ac=
cessible, less congested AI model deployment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20=

, this means greater flexibility to rapidly iterate on larger, more sophist=
icated models. For the industry, it signals a pivotal shift toward open, di=
versified compute ecosystems that could diminish dominance of heavyweight h=
ardware providers and usher in an era of more competitive, scalable model s=
