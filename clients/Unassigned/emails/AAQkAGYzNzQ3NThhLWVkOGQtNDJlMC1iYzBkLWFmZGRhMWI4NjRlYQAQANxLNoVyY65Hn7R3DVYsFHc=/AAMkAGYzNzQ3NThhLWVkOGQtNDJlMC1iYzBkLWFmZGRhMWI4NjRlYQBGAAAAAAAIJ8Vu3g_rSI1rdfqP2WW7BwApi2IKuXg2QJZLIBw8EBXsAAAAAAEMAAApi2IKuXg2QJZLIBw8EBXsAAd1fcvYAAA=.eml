RUSSIA LACKS AN ECONOMIC EXIT STRATEGY IN UKRAINE [3]
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS RELIEF, MOSCOW RISKS LOSING THE PEACE.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
Days before Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 15, Russian forces in Ukraine made their largest single-day gain in more than a year. Meanwhile, Russia in
recent weeks has launched its largest missile and drone strikes against Ukraine since the start of the war, including a major combined arms attack in Donbas on Aug. 22 involving Iskander ballistic
missiles, suicide drones and at least 50 aerial bombs.
The accelerated rate of Russian activity could indicate that it is seeking the strongest possible bargaining position and thus is serious about negotiations. At least some U.S. officials seem to hold
this view, including Vice President JD Vance, who said Aug. 24 that Moscow has “made significant concessions” and is “willing to be flexible” on some unspecified “core demands.” However,
even during Putin’s meeting with Trump, the Kremlin did not clearly define its position, instead repeating vague calls for a sustainable peace that addresses what it sees as the root causes of the
conflict and a rebalancing of security in Europe and the world.
Despite the toll the war has taken and the threat of more serious sanctions against Russia, Moscow’s hesitation and evasion reveal its uncertainty about ending the conflict. In addition to questions
about territory and security, no less important to Russia are the economic questions. Promises of sanctions relief are only part of the equation – the part that depends on external actors. The rest
has to do with the impending transition from a society and economy built for war toward one built for commerce.
WARTIME PERKS
In the war’s early days, Russia did not easily withstand the West’s sanctions campaign. Trade restrictions disrupted its export-heavy economy, squeezing the national budget. Even worse, foreign
companies pulled out of Russia, the supply of many war-related goods from abroad dried up, and when Moscow announced partial mobilization in September 2022, hundreds of thousands of mostly young,
skilled workers fled. Amid shortages of able-bodied men, money, technology, materials and know-how, Russia attempted to turn its economy into a self-sufficient military machine. The difficulty of the
task was evident on the front, where demand for ammunition and materiel outstripped supply – culminating in Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s ill-fated rebellion in June 2023.
With time, however, more and more businesses and resources were directed toward military production. Partly as a result, Russia’s economy continued to grow. In 2023, powered by a 4.6 percent
increase in industrial production, Russia’s gross domestic product grew by 4.1 percent. The absence of foreign competition provided a further boost for Russian banks and businesses, and in 2024, GDP
again increased by 4.1 percent. The economy flirted with overheating for a while but is now gradually cooling, and 2025 promises more growth.

The flipside of stability has been a growing role for the state in the Russian economy. The state and state-owned enterprises now account for anywhere between 30 percent and 70 percent of Russia’s
GDP, depending on the source of the data. Government orders swelled defense production, raising industrial output by 14 percent in 2024. Tank production tripled, rising from about 100 annually in
2020-21 to about 300 now, and some defense factories are operating around the clock. According to Putin, by 2024, more than 520,000 new jobs had been created in defense industries.
Generous pay for contract soldiers has also supported demand. After the unpopular partial mobilization, the Russian Defense Ministry emphasized hiring contract soldiers, and more than 200,000 citizens
have signed up over the past year. Recruits receive lump-sum bonuses of as much as 2.2 million rubles ($27,000) on average – and twice that in Moscow – plus monthly cash payments greatly exceeding
typical wages in most regions. Soldiers spend heavily during leave, boosting consumer demand in the civilian sector.

PEACE IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
The result of Moscow’s strategy to survive the West’s sanctions and win the war is a two-speed economy. The military and related sectors, supported by booming demand and state spending, have grown
rapidly. Civilian sectors, however, have had to go without state support for the most part. They have relied for their slower growth mainly on demand, some of which comes from unusually high payments
for soldiers.
For 2025, defense spending is projected to make up 32.5 percent of the budget – an unsustainably high rate. By the end of July, Russia’s federal budget deficit had already reached 4.9 trillion
rubles (2.2 percent of GDP), above the full-year target of 3.8 trillion rubles. The government is becoming more selective about what it will finance as a result.
However, before the war ends – and while it is still under sanctions and a budget deficit – the Kremlin must begin preparing for the postwar transition. Russia will continue to pour huge sums into
defense development and production even after the war – both for weapons exports and to keep pace with NATO’s rearmament – but spending likely will be much lower. The sudden drop in defense
orders will lead to layoffs, with particularly harsh consequences for regions dominated by defense enterprises. Meanwhile, the Kremlin will need to stimulate the civilian sector so that it can absorb
not only the soon-to-be unemployed defense industry workers but also the hundreds of thousands of contract soldiers returning from the front.
Shifting away from a war economy will require foreign investment, technology and renewed trade, and so Moscow will demand sanctions relief as part of any settlement. Replenishing the budget will be
critical, meaning Russia will insist on the abolition of restrictions against the oil industry, which still heavily depends on foreign technology. Also important will be ensuring the return of foreign
companies; Russia’s own sanctions-burdened producers – especially in pharmaceuticals, automobiles and electronics – struggled to increase output or produce sufficient substitutes. Necessary
though this will be, an influx of foreign products and the return of foreign competitors will challenge Russian firms, at least initially.
Another difficulty is wages. With exorbitantly high pay for the military and related industries distorting the labor market, the Kremlin needs to increase civilian-sector wages before the war is over
to maintain demand and avoid a labor crisis. But with economic growth slowing, labor demand may even fall, making it harder for the state to push wages higher. Meanwhile, defense industry workers and
contract soldiers (whose contracts guarantee their right to return to their former jobs) may be reluctant to take significantly lower-paying positions, and some will be drawn to the informal economy.
Finally, there is the risk that raising wages without boosting productivity will fuel inflation, eroding the benefits of higher pay.
All this may indicate that the Kremlin, lacking a clear exit strategy, is not seriously prepared to negotiate peace. Moscow has no plan for reintegrating soldiers or repurposing defense enterprises.
Discord between the central bank and the government further complicates policymaking. Therefore, in any negotiations, discussions of territorial concessions by Kyiv will not be enough – especially
while Russia’s advance is accelerating. Moscow will demand guarantees regarding foreign investment, the return of foreign businesses and access to foreign technology.

														</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Days before Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 15, Russian forces in Ukraine made their largest single-day gain in more than a year. Meanwhile, Russia in recent weeks has launched its largest missile and drone strikes against Ukraine since the start of the war, including a major combined arms attack in Donbas on Aug. 22 involving Iskander ballistic missiles, suicide drones and at least 50 aerial bombs.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The accelerated rate of Russian activity could indicate that it is seeking the strongest possible bargaining position and thus is serious about negotiations. At least some U.S. officials seem to hold this view, including Vice President JD Vance, who said Aug. 24 that Moscow has “made significant concessions” and is “willing to be flexible” on some unspecified “core demands.” However, even during Putin’s meeting with Trump, the Kremlin did not clearly define its position, instead repeating vague calls for a sustainable peace that addresses what it sees as the root causes of the conflict and a rebalancing of security in Europe and the world.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite the toll the war has taken and the threat of more serious sanctions against Russia, Moscow’s hesitation and evasion reveal its uncertainty about ending the conflict. In addition to questions about territory and security, no less important to Russia are the economic questions. Promises of sanctions relief are only part of the equation – the part that depends on external actors. The rest has to do with the impending transition from a society and economy built for war toward one built for commerce.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Wartime Perks</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the war’s early days, Russia did not easily withstand the West’s sanctions campaign. Trade restrictions disrupted its export-heavy economy, squeezing the national budget. Even worse, foreign companies pulled out of Russia, the supply of many war-related goods from abroad dried up, and when Moscow announced partial mobilization in September 2022, hundreds of thousands of mostly young, skilled workers fled. Amid shortages of able-bodied men, money, technology, materials and know-how, Russia attempted to turn its economy into a self-sufficient military machine. The difficulty of the task was evident on the front, where demand for ammunition and materiel outstripped supply – culminating in Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s ill-fated rebellion in June 2023.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With time, however, more and more businesses and resources were directed toward military production. Partly as a result, Russia’s economy continued to grow. In 2023, powered by a 4.6 percent increase in industrial production, Russia’s gross domestic product grew by 4.1 percent. The absence of foreign competition provided a further boost for Russian banks and businesses, and in 2024, GDP again increased by 4.1 percent. The economy flirted with overheating for a while but is now gradually cooling, and 2025 promises more growth.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The flipside of stability has been a growing role for the state in the Russian economy. The state and state-owned enterprises now account for anywhere between 30 percent and 70 percent of Russia’s GDP, depending on the source of the data. Government orders swelled defense production, raising industrial output by 14 percent in 2024. Tank production tripled, rising from about 100 annually in 2020-21 to about 300 now, and some defense factories are operating around the clock. According to Putin, by 2024, more than 520,000 new jobs had been created in defense industries.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Generous pay for contract soldiers has also supported demand. After the unpopular partial mobilization, the Russian Defense Ministry emphasized hiring contract soldiers, and more than 200,000 citizens have signed up over the past year. Recruits receive lump-sum bonuses of as much as 2.2 million rubles ($27,000) on average – and twice that in Moscow – plus monthly cash payments greatly exceeding typical wages in most regions. Soldiers spend heavily during leave, boosting consumer demand in the civilian sector.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Peace Is a Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The result of Moscow’s strategy to survive the West’s sanctions and win the war is a two-speed economy. The military and related sectors, supported by booming demand and state spending, have grown rapidly. Civilian sectors, however, have had to go without state support for the most part. They have relied for their slower growth mainly on demand, some of which comes from unusually high payments for soldiers.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For 2025, defense spending is projected to make up 32.5 percent of the budget – an unsustainably high rate. By the end of July, Russia’s federal budget deficit had already reached 4.9 trillion rubles (2.2 percent of GDP), above the full-year target of 3.8 trillion rubles. The government is becoming more selective about what it will finance as a result.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, before the war ends – and while it is still under sanctions and a budget deficit – the Kremlin must begin preparing for the postwar transition. Russia will continue to pour huge sums into defense development and production even after the war – both for weapons exports and to keep pace with NATO’s rearmament – but spending likely will be much lower. The sudden drop in defense orders will lead to layoffs, with particularly harsh consequences for regions dominated by defense enterprises. Meanwhile, the Kremlin will need to stimulate the civilian sector so that it can absorb not only the soon-to-be unemployed defense industry workers but also the hundreds of thousands of contract soldiers returning from the front.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Shifting away from a war economy will require foreign investment, technology and renewed trade, and so Moscow will demand sanctions relief as part of any settlement. Replenishing the budget will be critical, meaning Russia will insist on the abolition of restrictions against the oil industry, which still heavily depends on foreign technology. Also important will be ensuring the return of foreign companies; Russia’s own sanctions-burdened producers – especially in pharmaceuticals, automobiles and electronics – struggled to increase output or produce sufficient substitutes. Necessary though this will be, an influx of foreign products and the return of foreign competitors will challenge Russian firms, at least initially.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Another difficulty is wages. With exorbitantly high pay for the military and related industries distorting the labor market, the Kremlin needs to increase civilian-sector wages before the war is over to maintain demand and avoid a labor crisis. But with economic growth slowing, labor demand may even fall, making it harder for the state to push wages higher. Meanwhile, defense industry workers and contract soldiers (whose contracts guarantee their right to return to their former jobs) may be reluctant to take significantly lower-paying positions, and some will be drawn to the informal economy. Finally, there is the risk that raising wages without boosting productivity will fuel inflation, eroding the benefits of higher pay.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">All this may indicate that the Kremlin, lacking a clear exit strategy, is not seriously prepared to negotiate peace. Moscow has no plan for reintegrating soldiers or repurposing defense enterprises. Discord between the central bank and the government further complicates policymaking. Therefore, in any negotiations, discussions of territorial concessions by Kyiv will not be enough – especially while Russia’s advance is accelerating. Moscow will demand guarantees regarding foreign investment, the return of foreign businesses and access to foreign technology.</p>
