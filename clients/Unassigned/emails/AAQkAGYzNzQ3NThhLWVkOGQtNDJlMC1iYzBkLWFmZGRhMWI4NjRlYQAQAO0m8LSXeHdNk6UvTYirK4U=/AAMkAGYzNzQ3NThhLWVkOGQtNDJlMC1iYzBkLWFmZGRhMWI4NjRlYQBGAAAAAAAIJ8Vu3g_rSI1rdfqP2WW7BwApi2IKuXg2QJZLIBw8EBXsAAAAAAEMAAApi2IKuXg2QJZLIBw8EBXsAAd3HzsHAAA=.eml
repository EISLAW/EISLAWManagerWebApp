GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: ON RUSSIA'S CAPABILITIES IN UKRAINE [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
CALIBRATING CAPABILITY AND INTEREST IN UKRAINE [4]
Aug. 25, 2025
_Question: This article is an excellent summary of geopolitics. It hits all the key notes of military, politics and geography. How the Ukraine movie ends has different possibilities, and we can’t
imagine what a Putin-ordered escalation would look like. Even with drones, a concentrated 500+ tank assault on Ukrainian lines supported by 100,000 infantry and artillery, missiles and air power would
overwhelm whatever stood in its way. The Soviets lost huge numbers in WWII battles. Don’t you think Russia would be willing to sacrifice large casualties against a Western invasion?_
Response: I think that if the Russians had that capability, they would have used it a couple of years ago. More important, this is not World War II. Masses of troops and 500 tanks would make lovely
targets for drones using satellite imagery. War is no longer based on mass. It requires much more dispersed and agile forces to engage. I suspect that knocking out the vast supplies of fuel and shells
needed to supply 500 tanks would be the most efficient way to stop them. If you recall, in the first week of the war, there was a long line of Russian tanks that were stalled descending the road to
Kyiv due to a lack of fuel. But the central point in this war is that massed forces cannot survive long enough to engage the enemy. This war depends on detailed space-based intelligence and unmanned
aerial vehicles designed to destroy an enemy that can’t hide. The alternative is what Russia is doing with massive drone attacks on Ukraine’s cities. We saw in World War II why this strategy won't
work: German bombing of Russia or American bombing of Hamburg may have caused many civilian casualties, but it didn’t win the war.
-------------------------
_Question: Is Putin using maskirovka (invade and occupy Ukraine) as the critical “brick in the wall” of Russia’s southern buffer zone? Is Putin using maskirovka to test if the U.S. will risk
directly going to war with Russia?_
Response: Maskirovka means a masquerade, better called a bluff. I think that at this point, the reality of the Russian military in Ukraine is clear to all players. If there is a bluff, it is that the
Russians want to continue the war and are only pretending to want peace. In my view, the bluffing is over. The Russian army cannot overrun Ukraine and is struggling to add to even the small amount of
Ukrainian territory it has already captured. It is now widely known in and out of Russia that the war must end, not just because of the limits of Russian military power but also because of the
economic situation the war has created in Russia. So if it is a masquerade, it is not very convincing. There are now indications that Washington will allow U.S. oil companies to begin to do business
in Russia. I think this is meant to convince Moscow that the U.S. is not creating a masquerade when it says it wants to develop economic ties with Russia when the war ends. Masquerades are not
convincing for Moscow, and its fear of the United States reneging on its promise is minimal, as there are many opportunities for U.S. companies in Russia. So a certain reality has been in place for a
while, and masquerades are not very persuasive. You can’t bluff four aces when two are already on the table.
-------------------------
_Question: Did you consider the competition for access to rare earths and strategic metals? Another reason to support Ukraine’s “war for independence,” beyond the moral imperative of not
rewarding an aggressor for their aggression, is to prevent Russia from gaining access and thereby denying access for the U.S. to Ukraine’s rare earths and strategic metals. I think that was the
entire point of the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal, wasn’t it? The U.S. is severely behind both Russia and China in access to these materials, which are critical to a modern military._
Response: Rare earths are in fact not all that rare. There are many deposits in the world. Ukraine’s advantage on this is that it is one of several areas where rare earths are more concentrated and
require less effort to purify. At the beginning of the war, there was a great deal of talk that the Russians and Americans would compete for the rare earths. It would be nice to have, but I don’t
think this was ever a driver of the war, given that the conflict has cost a lot more than purifying less concentrated rare earths. The war has raged on for more than three years, and I have not heard
of any shortages of rare earths.
-------------------------
_Question: In your recent response [5] to questions about your conviction over the “depth of defense against NATO” concept, you just restated your conviction about the concept. You did not refute
or even acknowledge the existence of other points of view that the question implied made your position untenable. Putin’s expressed desire to restore the Soviet Union and to divert domestic
opposition, as well as his narcissistic ambitions, all seem to be plausible factors cited by many. The need for a strategic buffer to hold off Napoleon’s army or German Panzers seems to have been
overtaken by technology. You acknowledge that effect for naval warfare. Maybe you were right about Russia invading Ukraine, but for the wrong reasons?_
Response: If Putin’s desire was to restore the Soviet Union, it would be based on a complete misreading of Russia's own capabilities, which Mosocw might have noticed by the second year of the war.
As for Putin’s narcissism, all leaders of all countries are to some extent narcissists. The ability to believe that you can become the ruler of a country requires massive amounts of self-love and
self-admiration. Would he have liked to recover the Soviet borders? Possibly. But that would be a rational desire for Russia, having been invaded a number of times from the west and saved by the
distance to Moscow. Restoring that distance is a rational desire. If there was a defect in Putin, it was his lack of understanding of how wars are to be fought with today’s technology and his vast
underestimation of Ukrainian military capabilities. Those are capital offenses for a leader going to war. The U.S. had the same problem in Vietnam. I do not doubt that Putin hoped to reshuffle the
borders, but that was not a neurosis; it was a rational idea. I do think he, or his military, failed to understand the realities of war and the military balance. But let me emphasize: All U.S.
presidents by definition were narcissists with a high opinion of themselves.
-------------------------
_Question: You’ve explained why we can’t fight a conventional war with Russia. Why not just give a massive number of drones and missiles to the Ukrainians and let them pound Russia?_
Response: What would we do if Russia gave a large number of missiles to Iran or Cuba and allowed them to pound the United States? I suspect we would not only hit Iran and Cuba but also launch massive
numbers of missiles at Russia. We certainly wouldn’t let it slide, and I suggest that we would retaliate against Russia, given the casualties this move would inflict on the United States, and given
that the Russians couldn’t hide their involvement. There is a strong possibility that if we give Ukraine the weapons with which to devastate Russia, the Russians might decide to treat us the same
way. I am not speaking of nuclear weapons, but I doubt that the Russians could accept such a decision without responding in kind.
-------------------------
_Question: If the United States doesn’t support Ukraine against Russian aggression, won’t it lose the faith and trust of its allies?_
Response: Ukraine and the United States have not signed an agreement committing both sides to come to the aid of each other in case of war. They are therefore not allies. One of the U.S.’ top
geopolitical imperatives since the Cold War has been to reduce the amount of risk it incurs through alliances. The word for this is “credibility.” Given the Cold War alliances, the United States
was obligated to both defend allied countries and support opponents to Soviet moves around the world. The Vietnam War was justified in large part on the principle of credibility. The risk in avoiding
engaging a communist power was that our credibility was at stake. As President John F. Kennedy said, “Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any
burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”
During the Cold War, this statement represented the United States’ grand strategy, and it placed no limit on our vulnerability. The Cold War is now over, and a new imperative has emerged, which is
to reduce U.S. responsibility for the entire world. It is no longer essential for American interests to “bear any burden.” It was a painful but essential geopolitical imperative at the time, but
it has now become obsolete as the geopolitical system has shifted. The new geopolitical system allows for reducing the United States’ burdens. This is not an argument for or against this evolution;
it is simply meant to show a new geopolitical reality. Morally, no nation can be expected to permanently be committed to Kennedy’s words. It was inevitable that the U.S. would reduce its exposure to
risk beneath the level of that commitment.

Aug. 25, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: This=
 article is an excellent summary of geopolitics. It hits all the key notes =
of military, politics and geography. How the Ukraine movie ends has differe=
nt possibilities, and we can=E2=80=99t imagine what a Putin-ordered escalat=
ion would look like. Even with drones, a concentrated 500+ tank assault on =
Ukrainian lines supported by 100,000 infantry and artillery, missiles and a=
ir power would overwhelm whatever stood in its way. The Soviets lost huge n=
umbers in WWII battles. Don=E2=80=99t you think Russia would be willing to =
sacrifice large casualties against a Western invasion?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: I think =
that if the Russians had that capability, they would have used it a couple =
of years ago. More important, this is not World War II. Masses of troops an=
d 500 tanks would make lovely targets for drones using satellite imagery. W=
ar is no longer based on mass. It requires much more dispersed and agile fo=
rces to engage. I suspect that knocking out the vast supplies of fuel and s=
hells needed to supply 500 tanks would be the most efficient way to stop th=
em. If you recall, in the first week of the war, there was a long line of R=
ussian tanks that were stalled descending the road to Kyiv due to a lack of=
 fuel. But the central point in this war is that massed forces cannot survi=
ve long enough to engage the enemy. This war depends on detailed space-base=
d intelligence and unmanned aerial vehicles designed to destroy an enemy th=
at can=E2=80=99t hide. The alternative is what Russia is doing with massive=
 drone attacks on Ukraine=E2=80=99s cities. We saw in World War II why this=
 strategy won't work: German bombing of Russia or American bombing of Hambu=
rg may have caused many civilian casualties, but it didn=E2=80=99t win the =
war.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Is P=
utin using maskirovka (invade and occupy Ukraine) as the critical =E2=80=9C=
brick in the wall=E2=80=9D of Russia=E2=80=99s southern buffer zone? Is Put=
in using maskirovka to test if the U.S. will risk directly going to war wit=
h Russia?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Maskirov=
ka means a masquerade, better called a bluff. I think that at this point, t=
he reality of the Russian military in Ukraine is clear to all players. If t=
here is a bluff, it is that the Russians want to continue the war and are o=
nly pretending to want peace. In my view, the bluffing is over. The Russian=
 army cannot overrun Ukraine and is struggling to add to even the small amo=
unt of Ukrainian territory it has already captured. It is now widely known =
in and out of Russia that the war must end, not just because of the limits =
of Russian military power but also because of the economic situation the wa=
r has created in Russia. So if it is a masquerade, it is not very convincin=
g. There are now indications that Washington will allow U.S. oil companies =
to begin to do business in Russia. I think this is meant to convince Moscow=
 that the U.S. is not creating a masquerade when it says it wants to develo=
p economic ties with Russia when the war ends. Masquerades are not convinci=
ng for Moscow, and its fear of the United States reneging on its promise is=
 minimal, as there are many opportunities for U.S. companies in Russia. So =
a certain reality has been in place for a while, and masquerades are not ve=
ry persuasive. You can=E2=80=99t bluff four aces when two are already on th=
e table.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Did =
you consider the competition for access to rare earths and strategic metals=
? Another reason to support Ukraine=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cwar for independence=
,=E2=80=9D beyond the moral imperative of not rewarding an aggressor for th=
eir aggression, is to prevent Russia from gaining access and thereby denyin=
g access for the U.S. to Ukraine=E2=80=99s rare earths and strategic metals=
. I think that was the entire point of the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal, wasn=
=E2=80=99t it? The U.S. is severely behind both Russia and China in access =
to these materials, which are critical to a modern military.</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Rare ear=
ths are in fact not all that rare. There are many deposits in the world. Uk=
raine=E2=80=99s advantage on this is that it is one of several areas where =
rare earths are more concentrated and require less effort to purify. At the=
 beginning of the war, there was a great deal of talk that the Russians and=
 Americans would compete for the rare earths. It would be nice to have, but=
 I don=E2=80=99t think this was ever a driver of the war, given that the co=
nflict has cost a lot more than purifying less concentrated rare earths. Th=
e war has raged on for more than three years, and I have not heard of any s=
hortages of rare earths.</p>

 0px">your recent response</a> to questions about your conviction over the =
=E2=80=9Cdepth of defense against NATO=E2=80=9D concept, you just restated =
your conviction about the concept. You did not refute or even acknowledge t=
he existence of other points of view that the question implied made your po=
sition untenable. Putin=E2=80=99s expressed desire to restore the Soviet Un=
ion and to divert domestic opposition, as well as his narcissistic ambition=
s, all seem to be plausible factors cited by many. The need for a strategic=
 buffer to hold off Napoleon=E2=80=99s army or German Panzers seems to have=
 been overtaken by technology. You acknowledge that effect for naval warfar=
e. Maybe you were right about Russia invading Ukraine, but for the wrong re=
asons?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: If Putin=
=E2=80=99s desire was to restore the Soviet Union, it would be based on a c=
omplete misreading of Russia's own capabilities, which Mosocw might have no=
ticed by the second year of the war. As for Putin=E2=80=99s narcissism, all=
 leaders of all countries are to some extent narcissists. The ability to be=
lieve that you can become the ruler of a country requires massive amounts o=
f self-love and self-admiration. Would he have liked to recover the Soviet =
borders? Possibly. But that would be a rational desire for Russia, having b=
een invaded a number of times from the west and saved by the distance to Mo=
scow. Restoring that distance is a rational desire. If there was a defect i=
n Putin, it was his lack of understanding of how wars are to be fought with=
 today=E2=80=99s technology and his vast underestimation of Ukrainian milit=
ary capabilities. Those are capital offenses for a leader going to war. The=
 U.S. had the same problem in Vietnam. I do not doubt that Putin hoped to r=
eshuffle the borders, but that was not a neurosis; it was a rational idea. =
I do think he, or his military, failed to understand the realities of war a=
nd the military balance. But let me emphasize: All U.S. presidents by defin=
ition were narcissists with a high opinion of themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: You=
=E2=80=99ve explained why we can=E2=80=99t fight a conventional war with Ru=
ssia. Why not just give a massive number of drones and missiles to the Ukra=
inians and let them pound Russia?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: What wou=
ld we do if Russia gave a large number of missiles to Iran or Cuba and allo=
wed them to pound the United States? I suspect we would not only hit Iran a=
nd Cuba but also launch massive numbers of missiles at Russia. We certainly=
 wouldn=E2=80=99t let it slide, and I suggest that we would retaliate again=
st Russia, given the casualties this move would inflict on the United State=
s, and given that the Russians couldn=E2=80=99t hide their involvement. The=
re is a strong possibility that if we give Ukraine the weapons with which t=
o devastate Russia, the Russians might decide to treat us the same way. I a=
m not speaking of nuclear weapons, but I doubt that the Russians could acce=
pt such a decision without responding in kind.</p>
<hr>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: If t=
he United States doesn=E2=80=99t support Ukraine against Russian aggression=
, won=E2=80=99t it lose the faith and trust of its allies?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Ukraine =
and the United States have not signed an agreement committing both sides to=
 come to the aid of each other in case of war. They are therefore not allie=
s. One of the U.S.=E2=80=99 top geopolitical imperatives since the Cold War=
 has been to reduce the amount of risk it incurs through alliances. The wor=
d for this is =E2=80=9Ccredibility.=E2=80=9D Given the Cold War alliances, =
the United States was obligated to both defend allied countries and support=
 opponents to Soviet moves around the world. The Vietnam War was justified =
in large part on the principle of credibility. The risk in avoiding engagin=
g a communist power was that our credibility was at stake. As President Joh=
n F. Kennedy said, =E2=80=9CLet every nation know, whether it wishes us wel=
l or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, =
support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success o=
f liberty.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">During the Cold Wa=
r, this statement represented the United States=E2=80=99 grand strategy, an=
d it placed no limit on our vulnerability. The Cold War is now over, and a =
new imperative has emerged, which is to reduce U.S. responsibility for the =
entire world. It is no longer essential for American interests to =E2=80=9C=
bear any burden.=E2=80=9D It was a painful but essential geopolitical imper=
ative at the time, but it has now become obsolete as the geopolitical syste=
m has shifted. The new geopolitical system allows for reducing the United S=
tates=E2=80=99 burdens. This is not an argument for or against this evoluti=
on; it is simply meant to show a new geopolitical reality. Morally, no nati=
on can be expected to permanently be committed to Kennedy=E2=80=99s words. =
It was inevitable that the U.S. would reduce its exposure to risk beneath t=
he level of that commitment.</p>
