-chatgpt-still-sucks-for-work

ChatGPT still sucks. Claude still sucks. Gemini still sucks.
I don=E2=80=99t mean the models. The models are great. People are doing ama=
zing things, and I spend lots of time writing about it here. But all that m=
agic is coming from the models.=20
The tools themselves are still phenomenally underpowered for what we need.=
=20
The tools themselves=E2=80=94the chat interfaces=E2=80=94still suck.
We've crossed a billion users on AI chat platforms. A BILLION. That's one i=
n eight humans talking to machines. And here's the thing: nobody saw this c=
oming, including the model makers themselves.
ChatGPT was supposed to be a research demo. A way to show off GPT's capabil=
ities. Then it became the fastest growing consumer product in history. The =
model makers have been sprinting flat-out ever since =E2=80=93 racing to ma=
ke models smarter, faster, more capable. They're shipping breakthrough capa=
bilities every few months. It's genuinely incredible.
But that breakneck pace on model development means something had to give, a=
nd what gave was the interface. We're still using basically the same chat w=
indow from that initial demo three years ago. It's like we discovered fire =
and we're still carrying it around in our bare hands because nobody's had t=
ime to invent the torch.
This isn't the model makers' fault. They're doing exactly what they should =
be doing =E2=80=93 pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. But i=
t's created this wild situation where we have superhuman intelligence trapp=
ed behind an interface that can't even maintain consistent formatting in ex=
ports.
The good news? This gap is an enormous opportunity. Open source models have=
 democratized AI. The infrastructure is commoditized. Which means while the=
 big labs race toward AGI, there's room for builders to fix the boring, ess=
ential stuff that turns these from clever demos into actual workbenches whe=
re real work gets done.
Every problem I'm about to list has a solution. Most aren't even technicall=
y hard. They're just... waiting for someone to build them.
This is your invitation to jump in with me. Look at the 23 cocnrete proposa=
ls I have here for how to make chat into a real workbench. Tell me what you=
=E2=80=99d build. Tell me what=E2=80=99s missing. Tell me where I got it wr=
ong. So let's map out exactly what needs building. Together.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
From Clever Chat to Real Workbench: 23 Ways AI Chat Must Evolve
Three years into the AI revolution, and we're still stuck with chatbots tha=
t feel like demos, not tools. Chat is phenomenal for ideas. It's terrible a=
t turning those ideas into work you can ship.
I've spent countless hours in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini =E2=80=93 arguing wit=
h AI, arguing with people, and playing copy-paste ping-pong between them. T=
he open source revolution means we don't have to accept this anymore. We ca=
n build better. We should build better.
Here's exactly what needs to change. Twenty-three specific problems and the=
ir fixes. This isn't a wish list =E2=80=93 it's a blueprint.
And this is for you! Tell me in the comments which ones resonate, which one=
s I missed, and which ones you disagree with. Let=E2=80=99s make this a con=
versation!
Share & Work Together
1. Share Just the Relevant Slice
Right now it sucks that I can't share just the relevant slice of a chat wit=
h a friend and branch off of that to talk together and come back into the c=
hat.
Picture this: You've just spent 90 minutes working through a complex produc=
t strategy with ChatGPT. Buried in message #47 is pure gold =E2=80=93 a com=
petitive analysis that perfectly frames your market position. Your CMO need=
s to see this immediately. But your only options are: (1) Copy-paste it int=
o Slack, losing all context and formatting, (2) Share the entire conversati=
on including your twenty failed attempts and that embarrassing moment where=
 you called the AI "buddy," or (3) Try to recreate it in a new chat and hop=
e it comes out as good.
This is insane. We've had the ability to share specific parts of documents =
since the dawn of Google Docs. Hell, we can share specific timestamps in Yo=
uTube videos. But somehow, in our most advanced AI tools, we're stuck with =
all-or-nothing sharing.
Solve: Let me select specific messages and share a link to just that select=
ion. Give me view/comment/edit permissions. Let me redact the embarrassing =
bits with one click. When someone clicks my link, they see exactly what I w=
anted them to see =E2=80=93 no more, no less. They can start a new thread f=
rom that point, building on the good stuff without wading through the mess.=
 And here's the kicker: let me merge their improvements back into my main t=
hread. This is basic collaboration 101, and we don't have it.
2. End Copy-Paste Ping-Pong
Right now it sucks that collaboration is just copy-paste ping-pong. I have =
joked with other leaders that I feel like my entire day is arguing with AI =
or arguing with people and copying and pasting back and forth between them.
You know the dance: Generate something in ChatGPT. Copy it. Paste into Slac=
k. Colleague suggests changes. Copy their feedback. Paste into new ChatGPT =
message. Get revision. Copy that. Paste back to Slack. Repeat until your so=
ul leaves your body.
This isn't collaboration =E2=80=93 it's manual data transfer pretending to =
be teamwork. We're using $20/month AI subscriptions like they're typewriter=
s that happen to be good at math. The actual collaborative work =E2=80=93 t=
he back-and-forth, the building on ideas, the "yes, and" moments that creat=
e magic =E2=80=93 all happens outside the tool, mediated by Cmd+C and Cmd+V=
=2E
Solve: Live co-editing and comments on a single answer. Not the whole chat =
=E2=80=93 just the specific response we're working on. Let me see my collea=
gue typing their suggestion in real-time. Give us Google Docs-style "Sugges=
ting" mode where changes are tracked but not immediately applied. Let me @ =
mention someone to pull them into just this part of the conversation. Let m=
ultiple people iterate on the same AI response simultaneously, seeing each =
other's cursors, building together instead of playing telephone. Canvas in =
ChatGPT and Artifacts in Claude hint at this, but they don't go nearly far =
enough. Neither does the way Gemini handles code. We need real multiplayer,=
 not just better single-player.
3. Branch Without Wrecking the Original
Right now it sucks that trying a new angle just wrecks the original. There'=
s no idea of branching. If I want to start a new artifact, the canvas just =
can't handle that right now. The React component has difficulty with that r=
ight now. It certainly can't compare it side by side.
Here's a scenario that happens daily: You've got the AI to produce somethin=
g that's 80% perfect. You want to try a different approach for that last 20=
%, but you're terrified because the moment you prompt for changes, you migh=
t lose what's working. So what do you do? You copy everything to a separate=
 document "just in case," then proceed with fingers crossed. When the new v=
ersion is worse (which happens half the time), you're manually trying to fr=
ankenstein together the good parts from both versions.
This is how we worked before version control existed. It's why Git was revo=
lutionary for code. But somehow, we're still living in the pre-Git era for =
AI conversations.
Solve: "Branch this conversation" button. Try a completely different approa=
ch in a parallel thread. View both branches side-by-side in split screen. C=
herry-pick the best responses from each branch. Merge branches back togethe=
r when you've found the right path. Create checkpoint saves before risky ex=
periments. Name your branches ("formal approach," "casual approach," "techn=
ical deep-dive"). This isn't rocket science =E2=80=93 it's basic creative w=
orkflow that every designer, developer, and writer already understands. We =
just need it in chat.
4. Permalink to Specific Answers
Right now it sucks that I cannot point someone to one exact answer. I want =
to build a permalink to one message that was a banger that really got it ri=
ght, where like, for whatever reason, ChatGPT got it correct. I want to be =
able to point to that one answer.
We live in a world where I can link you to a specific tweet from 2009, a pa=
rticular comment on a Reddit thread from 2015, or the exact moment in a 3-h=
our podcast where someone says something brilliant. But when ChatGPT genera=
tes the perfect explanation of quantum computing or Claude nails the compet=
itive analysis I've been struggling with for weeks, that brilliance is trap=
ped. It exists only in my browser, in that session, inaccessible to the wor=
ld.
The best I can do is screenshot it (losing all text selection), copy-paste =
it (losing all formatting and context), or share my entire messy conversati=
on (overwhelming and embarrassing). This is knowledge hoarding by incompete=
nce, not design.
Solve: Every single message should have a permalink icon. Click it, get a l=
ink. That link should open to just that message, with enough context to mak=
e sense (the immediate prompt and response), but not the entire conversatio=
n history. Let me control visibility =E2=80=93 public, anyone with link, sp=
ecific people only. Add social features: let others react, bookmark, or bui=
ld on that specific response. Include attribution to the AI model and versi=
on. Make great AI responses as shareable and citable as tweets. This is how=
 knowledge actually spreads.
Say It Messy, Get a Clean Ask (Intent)
5. Stop Making Me Prompt Perfectly
Right now it sucks that you have to prompt right for best results. I have t=
o give you extensive input on prompting, like pages and pages and tens of p=
ages and hundreds of pages on prompting, because intent is not something LL=
Ms are good at understanding.
The prompt engineering industrial complex has turned us all into AI whisper=
ers. We've got prompt libraries, prompt templates, prompt marketplaces, and=
 entire courses on how to talk to AI. We're treating natural language inter=
faces like they're command lines that require perfect syntax. "You forgot t=
o say 'step by step,' so now the AI is confused." This is backwards. The wh=
ole point of natural language interfaces was to eliminate the need for perf=
ect syntax.
Meanwhile, I watch normal people =E2=80=93 smart people! =E2=80=93 get frus=
trated because they don't know the magic words. They type what they want, l=
ike humans do, and get subpar results. Then they blame themselves for not "=
prompting right." We've created a new digital divide: those who know the se=
cret handshakes and those who don't.
Solve: I type the gist, like "make a presentation about our Q3 results." Th=
e AI generates a dynamic form: "What's your audience? [C-suite] [Board] [Te=
am] [Public]. What style? [Formal report] [Visual story] [Quick bullets]. H=
ow long? [5 slides] [10 slides] [20 slides]. What data to include? [Revenue=
 only] [Full P&L] [Plus projections]." Each choice dynamically updates the =
other options. I click four checkboxes and get exactly what I want. No prom=
pt engineering required. The AI handles the translation from human intent t=
o precise instruction. Comet shows the way here =E2=80=93 they generate dyn=
amic interfaces for sending emails. We need this for everything.
6. Let Me Choose: Coach Me or Just Do It
Right now it sucks that sometimes I want to be coached and sometimes I want=
 to take action and sometimes I want the LLM to take action. And I can't co=
nvey any of that because there's only one personality and the personality s=
eems to come pre-built with the LLM.
Tuesday morning, I need the AI to challenge my thinking, ask hard questions=
, and make me defend my position. Tuesday afternoon, I need it to shut up a=
nd just write the damn email. Wednesday, I need it to take my rough notes a=
nd run with them for an hour without bothering me. But every interaction fe=
els the same =E2=80=93 like talking to an eager intern who always wants to =
please but never knows whether to lead or follow.
ChatGPT launched Learn mode, but I've heard it's kind of broken because Cha=
tGPT-4o's personality is so freaking eager it overrides everything. Claude =
tries with its brevity settings. But these are band-aids on a fundamental p=
roblem: AIs have one interaction mode, and we have dozens of working modes.
Solve: Give me a dial for agenticness. Literally a slider from 0 to 11 (yes=
, like Spinal Tap). At 0: "Just answer my question directly, no elaboration=
=2E" At 3: "Give me context but stay fo=
cused." At 6: "Coach me through this,=20=
ask clarifying questions." At 9: "Take this and run with it, check in only =
for major decisions." At 11: "Go away for three hours and come back with so=
mething complete." Let me save presets: "Morning brainstorm mode," "Afterno=
on execution mode," "Late night just-fix-it mode." Different tasks need dif=
ferent levels of AI autonomy, and right now we're stuck with one-size-fits-=
none.
7. One-Tap Output Reshaping
Right now it sucks that reshaping outputs takes forever. It is so hard when=
 I have something that's about the right draft and I want to make it more s=
trategic or make it for the C-suite. How about you make it more crisp? How =
about you use real examples?
You've been there: The AI gives you something that's 70% right. The content=
 is solid, but the tone is off. Or the structure is wrong. Or it's too long=
=2E Or too technical. So you start the=20=
negotiation: "Make it more executive-l=
evel but not condescending, shorter but keep all the key points, add exampl=
es but real ones not generic ones, and can you make it sound more confident=
 but not arrogant?" Three iterations later, you've lost the things that wer=
e good in the original and added new problems.
This is like trying to edit a photo by describing the changes in words inst=
ead of using adjustment sliders. "Make the sky more blue but not unrealisti=
c blue, increase the contrast but not too much, and can you make me look yo=
unger but not fake?" Imagine if Photoshop worked this way.
Solve: Dynamic contextual controls that appear based on what you're working=
 on. For business documents: [More strategic =E2=86=90 =E2=86=92 More tacti=
cal] [Shorter =E2=86=90 =E2=86=92 More detailed] [Add data =E2=86=90 =E2=86=
=92 Add stories]. For creative writing: [More descriptive =E2=86=90 =E2=86=
=92 More direct] [Faster pace =E2=86=90 =E2=86=92 Slower pace] [More dialog=
ue =E2=86=90 =E2=86=92 More narrative]. One-tap presets: "Board ready," "Te=
am meeting," "Customer facing," "Technical documentation." And here's the c=
rucial part: show me the changes in real-time with track changes, so I can =
accept or reject each adjustment. Don't make me re-read everything to figur=
e out what changed.
Turn Answers Into Real Work
8. Clean Exports That Actually Work
Right now it sucks that exports break formatting. Right now, clean exports =
to docs, to Notion, they don't keep code blocks intact all the time. They d=
on't keep headings clear. There's all kinds of weirdness that happens with =
copy-paste exports.
Let me paint you the actual nightmare: You've spent two hours getting ChatG=
PT to create the perfect technical specification. It's got headers, subhead=
ers, bullet points, code blocks, tables, and inline links. You select all, =
copy, paste into your company wiki... and it looks like someone put your do=
cument in a blender. Code blocks become plain text with no indentation. Tab=
les turn into tab-separated nonsense. Headers are just bold text. Links som=
etimes work, sometimes don't. Markdown symbols appear randomly like digital=
 graffiti.
So you spend another 30 minutes reformatting everything manually. By which =
point you could have just written the damn thing yourself. Grok is absolute=
ly horrific about this, but Grok is not the only one. Every AI tool seems t=
o have its own special way of mangling exports.
Solve: Real export functionality with format preservation. Not copy-paste =
=E2=80=93 actual export. "Export to Google Docs" should create a properly f=
ormatted document with styles intact. "Export to Notion" should understand =
Notion's block types and create proper toggles, callouts, and databases. "E=
xport to GitHub" should create properly formatted Markdown with functional =
code blocks. Include a preview before export. Let me choose between "preser=
ve formatting exactly" and "adapt to platform conventions." And here's a wi=
ld idea: use MCP (Model Context Protocol) or build a middleware layer that =
actually understands different platforms' formatting requirements. This is =
basic interoperability, and it's embarrassing that we don't have it in 2025=
=2E
9. Surface Action Items
Right now it sucks that action items just disappear into the chat scroll. L=
ike, if it's a task due on Friday and you remind me, don't just make it ano=
ther chat. Put it in yellow, highlight it, give me a little calendar view o=
f upcoming tasks.
Here's what happens now: You're planning a project with AI. Throughout the =
conversation, action items emerge naturally: "Schedule meeting with Sarah b=
y Wednesday," "Review competitor pricing before Friday," "Send draft to leg=
al by EOD Monday." These critical commitments are buried in paragraphs of t=
ext, indistinguishable from everything else. By tomorrow, you've forgotten =
half of them. By Friday, Sarah's wondering why you never scheduled that mee=
ting.
We're using AI to help us work, but it doesn't understand the basic concept=
 that some output is actionable and some is just information. Everything ge=
ts the same treatment =E2=80=93 another message in an endless scroll.
Solve: Automatic action item detection with visual distinction. When the AI=
 generates something actionable, it should know it. Highlight it in yellow.=
 Put a checkbox next to it. Extract all action items to a persistent sideba=
r. Let me set due dates with one click. Integrate with actual task managers=
 =E2=80=93 Todoist, Notion, Asana, or even just Apple Reminders. Give me a =
weekly view of all AI-generated tasks across all my conversations. Send me =
a daily digest of what's due. Add a "completed" state that I can check off =
right in the chat. This isn't advanced AI =E2=80=93 it's basic productivity=
 that we've had in project management tools for twenty years.
10. Publish Clean Summaries for Stakeholders
Right now it sucks that stakeholders, stakeholders don't want the messy thr=
ead, but they have to get the messy thread if they want to see how you work=
=2E Find a way to give me a published page.
Your CEO asks for an AI-assisted market analysis. You spend three hours wit=
h ChatGPT, iterating, refining, pulling in data, adjusting the angle. The f=
inal output is brilliant. But to share it, you either send them a 200-messa=
ge conversation full of dead ends and corrections, or you copy-paste just t=
he final answer and look like you're hiding your process. There's no middle=
 ground.
This is especially painful when you're trying to show the value of AI tools=
 to skeptics. They need to see the result, not the sausage-making. But they=
 also need to trust the process. Right now, we can't give them either exper=
ience elegantly.
Solve: "Publish Page" button that creates a beautiful, read-only summary. I=
t automatically identifies the key messages =E2=80=93 the final answer, imp=
ortant intermediate results, key data points. Arranges them in a logical fl=
ow, not chronological order. Adds a table of contents. Includes a "methodol=
ogy" note that explains the AI interaction without showing every message. G=
enerates a unique link with optional password protection. Tracks who viewed=
 it and when. Allows comments but not edits. Includes discrete attribution:=
 "Generated with assistance from Claude 3.5." Think of it as a automated re=
port generator that turns messy collaboration into polished deliverables. M=
edium does this for writing, Notion does it for wikis =E2=80=93 why can't A=
I chats do it for AI work?
Keep It Updated Without Babysitting
11. Smart Scheduled Updates
Right now it sucks that I have to remember to rerun things. So the schedule=
d tasks feature in ChatGPT is not enough here. I want something that I can =
schedule that will update dynamically as sources change.
You create a competitive analysis on Monday. By Friday, two competitors hav=
e announced new features, one got funded, and another changed their pricing=
=2E Your beautiful analysis is already=20=
outdated, but you don't know it. You'r=
e making decisions based on stale intelligence. Two weeks later, you rememb=
er to rerun the analysis, and you realize you've been operating on bad info=
rmation.
This is the difference between static documents and living intelligence. Ri=
ght now, every AI output is a snapshot =E2=80=93 accurate for that moment, =
increasingly wrong over time. We need AI that keeps its answers fresh witho=
ut us babysitting it.
Solve: "Watch this" mode for any important output. Set update conditions: "=
Check weekly," "Check when these URLs change," "Check when this search has =
new results." The AI reruns the analysis automatically but =E2=80=93 and th=
is is crucial =E2=80=93 only alerts you if something materially changed. It=
 doesn't spam you with "still the same" notifications. Show me what percent=
age changed. Highlight the deltas. Give me a changelog: "3 new competitors =
identified, 2 pricing changes detected, 1 product sunset noted." Let me set=
 thresholds: "Only alert if confidence drops below 80% or if more than 20% =
of facts change." If you're gonna promise me agents, give me smart agents t=
hat know when their information is getting stale.
12. Show Me What Changed
Right now it sucks that updates to code force me to reread everything. It s=
hould not be that hard to just refresh with differences. Show me what chang=
ed since last time.
The AI rewrites your 500-line script. Did it change one function or restruc=
ture everything? Who knows! You're playing the world's worst game of "spot =
the difference," reading through everything line by line, trying to remembe=
r what the old version looked like. Sometimes the changes are subtle but cr=
itical. Sometimes they're massive but cosmetic. Without diff view, you can'=
t tell which is which.
This is particularly maddening with iterative improvements. "Make it faster=
" could mean adding one line of caching or rewriting the entire algorithm. =
"Fix the bug" could be a typo correction or a fundamental logic change. We'=
re flying blind.
Solve: Automatic diff view for any regenerated content. Not just for code =
=E2=80=93 for everything. Documents, emails, strategies, analyses. Show me =
green for additions, red for deletions, yellow for modifications. Give me a=
 summary: "15% changed, mostly in sections 3 and 5." Let me toggle between =
"show full document" and "show only changes." Add a "changes sidebar" that =
lists what was modified and why. Include confidence indicators: "High confi=
dence improvement" vs "Experimental change." And here's the power feature: =
let me selectively accept or reject individual changes while keeping others=
=2E This is table stakes for any seriou=
s editing tool, and AI outputs despera=
tely need it.
Trust & Control
13. Show Me the Receipts
Right now it sucks that I cannot easily see where claims come from. There a=
re these little chips and I know that this is quote unquote better than it =
was before. And sometimes it makes it up and doesn't list chips.
The AI confidently states: "73% of Fortune 500 companies are using AI in pr=
oduction." Sounds plausible. Is it true? Who knows! Maybe it's from a McKin=
sey report from last week. Maybe it's from a blog post from 2019. Maybe it'=
s completely hallucinated but sounds reasonable so the AI went with it. You=
're about to put this in a board presentation, and you have no idea if you'=
re about to embarrass yourself.
This isn't just about accuracy =E2=80=93 it's about trust. Every unsourced =
claim erodes confidence. Every hallucination discovered later makes you que=
stion everything else. We're building critical business intelligence on fou=
ndations we can't verify.
Solve: "Show receipts" button on any response containing factual claims. Op=
ens a sidebar with every source, linked and timestamped. Not just URLs =E2=
=80=93 actual quotes from the sources with context. Confidence scores for e=
ach claim. Red flags for unsourced assertions. And here's the crucial part:=
 let me run a verification job that actually checks if those URLs exist and=
 if they say what the AI claims they say. Perplexity does this better than =
most, but even they don't go far enough. I want to be able to export the ci=
tations as formatted footnotes. Copy them as Markdown. Build a bibliography=
=2E This is how trust is built =E2=80=93 through verification, not faith.
14. Control What Gets Remembered
Right now it sucks that the app remembers the wrong stuff across chats. Yes=
, there's a memory panel in chat GPT. There's not in Claude. I want to see =
which memories are being pulled into this chat and have the option to edit =
them.
ChatGPT remembers that one time I mentioned I like coffee but forgets the e=
ntire structure of the product I've been building for six months. It rememb=
ers my dog's name but not my coding preferences. It remembers I'm intereste=
d in productivity but forgets the specific frameworks I use. The memory sys=
tem has the priorities of someone with ADHD scrolling Twitter =E2=80=93 ran=
dom facts stick, important patterns don't.
And worse: I can't see what memories are actively influencing this conversa=
tion. Is it remembering that I prefer concise answers, or is that from thre=
e months ago when I was in a different role? Is it applying those Python pr=
eferences to my JavaScript question? I'm getting responses shaped by invisi=
ble context I can't inspect or correct.
Solve: Visible memory panel for every conversation. Show me exactly which m=
emories are being applied. Let me toggle them on or off for this chat. Pin =
important memories that should always apply. Archive outdated ones without =
deleting them. Create memory groups: "Python projects," "Marketing work," "=
Personal writing." Let me switch memory contexts like switching user profil=
es. Add memory versioning =E2=80=93 see how my preferences have evolved ove=
r time. Export my entire memory graph. Import memories from other accounts.=
 And please, for the love of all that is holy, let me tell the AI "forget e=
verything about X" and have it actually forget, not just pretend to forget =
while secretly remembering.
15. Private Mode for Sensitive Work
Right now it sucks that how sensitive work feels risky. I know the New York=
 Times lawsuit and chat GPT is particularly affected here because they're b=
eing obligated to retain chats they wouldn't otherwise. But even leaving th=
at aside, you want to be in a position where you can have threads that auto=
-delete.
You're working on: acquisition strategies, layoff planning, legal disputes,=
 medical information, relationship advice, financial problems. This is the =
stuff that actually matters, that keeps you up at night, that you most need=
 help with. But you're terrified to put it in the chat because who knows wh=
ere it's stored, who might see it, what might leak, or how it might be used=
 to train future models.
So you self-censor. You use vague language. You omit crucial details. And y=
ou get worse help because of it. The tool that should be most helpful when =
stakes are highest becomes least useful exactly when you need it most.
Solve: True private mode with multiple privacy levels. "Ephemeral": auto-de=
letes after 24 hours, no storage, no training. "Local-only": never leaves y=
our device, runs on-device models if available. "Region-locked": data never=
 leaves your legal jurisdiction. "Encrypted": end-to-end encryption where e=
ven the AI provider can't read it. Clear indicators showing current privacy=
 level. Audit logs showing what was retained and what was deleted. Legal ho=
lds for business accounts that need compliance. Data residence guarantees f=
or enterprise. And here's the thing: charge more for it. People will pay fo=
r privacy. Make it a premium feature. Just make it exist.
16. Show Me the Meter
Right now it sucks that I don't know the cost or the time until it's too la=
te. Just if I'm in the API, continue to invest in making those costs really=
 clear. If I am in the chat and I have a certain number of messages on my p=
lan, show me the number of messages left.
You're deep in flow, iterating on something important. Then suddenly: "You'=
ve reached your message limit. Try again in 3 hours." Or worse, you're usin=
g the API and discover you've burned through $50 in an afternoon because th=
at one prompt triggered a recursive loop you didn't notice. There's no spee=
dometer, no fuel gauge, no warning lights =E2=80=93 just sudden stops.
This is especially painful for teams. Someone burns through the company's A=
PI credits on a Friday afternoon experiment, and Monday's critical work gri=
nds to a halt. Or you're presenting to a client, hit the rate limit mid-dem=
o, and stand there looking incompetent.
Solve: Real-time meters visible during every interaction. Token counter tha=
t increments as you type. Cost calculator showing price in real money, not =
just tokens. Time estimate before you send the prompt. Warning when approac=
hing limits: "5 messages remaining today." Optional hard caps: "Stop if thi=
s conversation exceeds $10." Usage dashboard showing patterns: "You use 80%=
 of your credits on Tuesdays." Predictive warnings: "At current rate, you'l=
l exceed your limit by Thursday." Team controls: individual budgets, approv=
al for expensive operations, usage reports by person and project. Make it i=
mpossible to be surprised by limits or costs.
Find and Reuse
17. Auto-Group Into Projects
Right now it sucks that finished work gets buried. I would love to be able =
to auto group threads into a project. ChatGPT, for goodness sake, is able t=
o know what related threads are. Just auto group them together, pin the bes=
t answers at the top, and highlight them.
I have 847 ChatGPT conversations. Somewhere in there are the five conversat=
ions where I developed my product strategy. Also scattered throughout: the =
twelve conversations about competitive analysis, the eight about pricing mo=
dels, the fifteen about technical architecture. But they're mixed in with r=
ecipe requests, movie recommendations, and that time I used ChatGPT to writ=
e a complaint email to my airline.
Finding anything requires archaeology. I know I solved this problem before,=
 but was it last Tuesday or three weeks ago? Was it in ChatGPT or Claude? W=
hat did I even title that chat? The default titles are useless: "Python ass=
istance" could be anything from a one-line fix to a complete application ar=
chitecture.
Solve: Automatic intelligent grouping into projects. The AI already knows t=
hese conversations are related =E2=80=93 use that intelligence. Auto-detect=
 when multiple chats are about the same topic. Suggest project groupings: "=
Looks like these 8 chats are about your SaaS pricing model. Group them?" Pi=
n the best responses to the project top. Create project summaries: "Here's =
what you've learned about competitive positioning across all conversations.=
" Show project evolution: timeline view of how your thinking developed. Let=
 me manually adjust groupings. Share entire projects with teammates. Export=
 projects as knowledge bases. Archive completed projects. Search within pro=
jects. This is how professional work actually happens =E2=80=93 in projects=
, not individual conversations.
18. Quote From Previous Chats
Right now it sucks that I have to reinvent paragraphs that I've already wri=
tten. I want to pull a paragraph from an old chat that I can link back and =
just dynamically pull it in and say, this is great, more like this.
Three weeks ago, you got the AI to write the perfect explanation of your pr=
oduct's value proposition. Today, you need something similar for a differen=
t audience. But that perfect paragraph is buried somewhere in your chat his=
tory. So you try to recreate it from memory, and it's never quite as good. =
You've lost the exact phrasing that made it work.
This happens constantly: You solve a problem, craft the perfect explanation=
, nail the tone... and then it's gone. Not deleted, just unreachable. It ex=
ists in your account, but might as well not exist at all. We're constantly =
reinventing wheels we already built.
Solve: Cross-chat quotation and reference system. Type "@" and start search=
ing across all your chats. Find that perfect paragraph. Click to insert it =
as a quote with automatic attribution: "From chat about 'Product Strategy' =
on Jan 3." But here's the power move: make it dynamic. When you update the =
original, give me the option to update all places that quote it. Build a pe=
rsonal knowledge graph of your best AI interactions. See which responses yo=
u reference most. Track the evolution of your thinking. Create "canonical a=
nswers" that become your source of truth. This is how you build intellectua=
l capital with AI, not just have conversations with it.
19. Search That Actually Finds Things
Right now it sucks that search cannot find any kind of dynamic hiring score=
card. If you're trying to find "that hiring scorecard thing," you should be=
 able to dig into JD, job description, and scorecard all at the same time. =
Even if the name is completely different and says something like "new strat=
egy."
Current search is a joke. It's literal string matching in a world of semant=
ic meaning. You search for "hiring scorecard" and miss the conversation tit=
led "New team member evaluation criteria." You search for "Python bug" and =
get every conversation where you mentioned Python and every conversation wh=
ere you mentioned bugs, but not the one where you said "the code isn't work=
ing."
This is especially maddening when you know you solved something but used di=
fferent words. Did you call it a "dashboard" or a "control panel"? Did you =
say "customer churn" or "retention rate"? Was it "unit economics" or "contr=
ibution margin"? You end up trying dozens of search terms like you're playi=
ng password with your past self.
Solve: True semantic search that understands meaning, not just matches stri=
ngs. Search for "hiring" and find results about "recruitment," "talent acqu=
isition," "team building," and "interview process." Search for concepts: "t=
hat time we discussed startup metrics" should find conversations about CAC,=
 LTV, burn rate, and runway even if you never used the word "metrics." Filt=
er by entity: person mentioned, company discussed, technology used. Filter =
by time: "last week," "in October," "before the launch." Filter by outcome:=
 "successful solutions," "final versions," "shipped work." Search within re=
sults. Save search queries. Get search suggestions based on your corpus: "D=
id you mean the conversation about Python async patterns?" This is 2025. Go=
ogle has been doing semantic search for a decade. Why is AI chat search wor=
se than Gmail search from 2010?
Quality of Life
20. Generate Forms, Not Twenty Questions
Right now it sucks that it asks 20 questions instead of just taking inputs.=
 It should generate forms for me more often if it sees that I'm working thr=
ough something structured. What if I upload a PDF and it's a government for=
m? Can't it dynamically generate the form and let me fill in little pieces?
You need to plan an event. The AI responds: "What type of event? How many p=
eople? What's your budget? What date? What location? What's the purpose? Wh=
o's the audience? What's the desired outcome?" Each question is a separate =
message. Each answer triggers more questions. By question twelve, you've fo=
rgotten what you're even trying to accomplish. This isn't assistance =E2=80=
=93 it's an interrogation.
Or worse: You upload a tax form PDF. The AI could recognize it's a form and=
 generate fields for you to fill in. Instead, it asks you to describe what =
you need help with, then walks through each field one by one in chat messag=
es. A process that should take two minutes takes twenty.
Solve: Smart form generation based on context. Detect when multiple inputs =
are needed. Generate a dynamic form with all fields visible at once. Includ=
e help text for each field. Show field dependencies: selecting "Virtual eve=
nt" hides the "Venue" field. Validate inputs: "Date must be in the future."=
 Pre-fill from previous similar requests. Save form templates for reuse. Fo=
r uploaded forms, OCR them and generate fillable versions with the AI coach=
ing you through complex fields. Let me tab through fields like a real form.=
 Submit all at once and get a comprehensive response, not a drip feed of an=
swers. This is basic UX that we solved in web forms twenty years ago.
21. Consistent Tone Without Whiplash
Right now it sucks that how much tone whiplash wastes edits. The tone prese=
ts are really clunky and they over-index way too fast. And it's so painful =
to edit back and forth.
First response: Professional and formal. Second response: Suddenly casual a=
nd using emoji. Third response: Academic and verbose. Fourth response: Ters=
e and technical. You're not having one conversation =E2=80=93 you're talkin=
g to someone with multiple personality disorder. Every response requires to=
ne correction, and correcting tone often breaks the content.
This is exhausting when you're trying to maintain consistency across a docu=
ment. You spend more time fixing tone mismatches than improving substance. =
And the presets =E2=80=93 when they exist =E2=80=93 are like hitting a nail=
 with a sledgehammer. "Professional" becomes robotic. "Casual" becomes unpr=
ofessional. There's no nuance, no middle ground, no consistency.
Solve: Tone fingerprinting and preservation. Analyze my preferred tone from=
 past successful outputs. Create a tone profile: "Nate writes professionall=
y but conversationally, uses specific examples, avoids jargon unless necess=
ary, prefers active voice, uses short paragraphs." Let me save multiple ton=
e profiles: "Client emails," "Internal docs," "Blog posts," "Technical spec=
s." Show me tone consistency scores. Flag when responses deviate from estab=
lished tone. Provide one-click tone matching: "Match the tone of message #1=
5." Let me adjust tone on sliding scales, not binary switches: Formal =E2=
=86=90=E2=86=92 Casual, Verbose =E2=86=90=E2=86=92 Concise, Technical =E2=
=86=90=E2=86=92 Accessible. Lock tone for entire conversations. Export tone=
 profiles to share with team members. This is how you get from random outpu=
ts to consistent voice.
22. Roll Back to the Good Version
Right now it sucks that I cannot roll back to the good one from this mornin=
g. Version history and quick restore on chats, like we just don't have it. =
If I go into the canvas, I can't roll back to the good one. If I go into Cl=
aude, the best thing I can do is click on a previous version.
It's 3 PM. The version you had at 10 AM was perfect, but you've been "impro=
ving" it all day. Now it's worse. You can see the old version in the chat h=
istory, but you can't restore it. You can't make it the active version. You=
 can manually copy-paste it into a new message, but then you lose all the c=
ontext and subsequent improvements that were actually good.
This is maddening when you're iterating. You try five approaches. Version 3=
 was the best, but you're now on version 8. There's no way to go back to 3 =
and branch from there. No way to compare 3 and 8 side by side. No way to ta=
ke the introduction from 3, the middle from 5, and the conclusion from 8. W=
e're working like it's 1995.
Solve: Full version history with visual timeline. See every version as a po=
int on a timeline. Click any point to preview that version. "Restore this v=
ersion" makes it active. Compare any two versions side by side. Create name=
d checkpoints: "Before client feedback," "After legal review," "Final draft=
=2E" Branch from any historical version=
=2E Merge elements from multiple version=
s. See who made which changes if in collaborative mode. Add commit messages=
: "Fixed data table, improved conclusion." Search through version history. =
Export version history. Set up auto-checkpoints before major changes. This =
is basic version control that Git figured out decades ago. Every creative t=
ool has it. Why don't AI chats?
23. Actually Understand What Mode I Need
Right now it sucks that I don't have great mode control. Sometimes I'm brai=
nstorming and need wild creativity. Sometimes I'm documenting and need perf=
ect accuracy. Sometimes I'm shipping and need polish. The AI treats everyth=
ing the same.
Monday morning brainstorm: I need the AI to be creative, exploratory, "yes-=
and" everything. Tuesday documentation: I need precision, citations, techni=
cal accuracy. Wednesday client presentation: I need polish, professionalism=
, strategic framing. But the AI doesn't know the difference. It gives me ci=
tations when I'm brainstorming and creativity when I need facts.
This context-blindness wastes enormous time. You ask for ideas and get a st=
ructured report. You ask for documentation and get creative writing. You're=
 constantly fighting against the AI's inability to read the room.
Solve: Intelligent mode detection with manual override. Detect intent from =
context: "Let's brainstorm" triggers creative mode. "Document this process"=
 triggers precision mode. "Polish for the board" triggers executive mode. S=
how current mode with easy switching. Learn my patterns: "Monday mornings a=
re usually brainstorm mode." Adjust behavior completely: Creative mode has =
no citations, encourages wild ideas, uses "What if..." Precision mode requi=
res sources, flags uncertainty, uses careful language. Polish mode focuses =
on clarity, impact, persuasion. Let me create custom modes: "Grant writing =
mode," "Code review mode," "Therapy mode" (yes, people do this). Save mode =
preferences per project. Export mode definitions to share with teams. This =
is how you get from one-size-fits-all to actually useful.
The Call to Action: This Is Our Moment
Here's what is really frustrating: Every single feature I've described alre=
ady exists in other software. Version control? Git solved it in 2005. Real-=
time collaboration? Google Docs had it in 2010. Smart search? Gmail's had i=
t for fifteen years. Dynamic forms? Every web app since 2000.
We're not asking for breakthrough AI research. We're asking for basic produ=
ct design.
The technical barriers are gone. Open source models are incredible. The inf=
rastructure exists. The only thing missing is the will and passion to build=
 it. And that's where we all come in.
If you're a user: Stop accepting that this is just how AI tools work. Every=
 time something sucks, let=E2=80=99s talk about it. Be specific. Share it. =
Tag the companies. They're listening, but they need to hear a chorus, not w=
hispers. We need to be clear about what we want and not just passively acce=
pt the default interfaces. Steve Jobs has a quote about that. About people =
who loved something enough to build it=E2=80=94well let=E2=80=99s see if we=
 can=E2=80=99t work up the passion to change this.
=E2=80=9CEverything around you that you call life was made up by people tha=
t were no smarter than you=E2=80=94and you can change it, you can influence=
 it, you can build your own things that other people can use.=E2=80=9D - St=
eve Jobs
If you're a builder: Pick ONE problem from this list. Just one. Solve it co=
mpletely. Not 80%, not "good enough" =E2=80=93 solve it so well that everyo=
ne else has to copy you. One perfect solution beats fifty features that kin=
d of work. The market is desperate for this. And I=E2=80=99ll add=E2=80=94s=
olve it interoperably. Pick a problem space that you can solve across multi=
ple models at once.
If you're at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google: Your models are incredible. Your in=
terfaces are not. You've solved the hard problem (AGI) but not the easy one=
 (UX). Your users are drowning in copy-paste hell while you're focused on b=
enchmark scores. Fix the basics. Your moat isn't your model =E2=80=93 it's =
supposed to be your product.=20
If you're a journalist: Please stop writing about parameter counts and star=
t writing about usability. The story isn't "AI gets smarter." The story is =
"AI still can't export to Google Docs without breaking everything."
We're three years into the AI revolution. Three years! We've built artifici=
al general intelligence but can't build a decent share button. We've create=
d models that pass the bar exam but can't give us dialable tone or agency. =
We've achieved superhuman performance on benchmarks but subhuman performanc=
e on basic collaboration.
This is embarrassing. And it's an opportunity.
The first company to nail even half of these problems doesn't just win the =
market =E2=80=93 they change how a billion people work. They graduate us fr=
om the prompt engineering stone age to the actual AI-assisted future we wer=
e promised.
Make chat shareable, shippable, and self-maintaining. Share slices, not nov=
els. Ship work, not drafts. Maintain quality without babysitting.
That's not a wish list. That's a requirement. That's the minimum bar for pr=
ofessional tools in 2025.
The models are ready. The users are ready. The market is ready.
The only question is: Who's going to build it?
What did I miss? What drives you absolutely insane about AI chat that's not=
 on this list? What would you build first?
If you're building solutions to any of these problems =E2=80=93 even just o=
ne =E2=80=93 reach out. I test everything. I write about what works. And I =
share it with 29,000+ readers who are just as frustrated as we are.
The future isn't waiting for better models. It's waiting for better product=
s. Let's build them.
