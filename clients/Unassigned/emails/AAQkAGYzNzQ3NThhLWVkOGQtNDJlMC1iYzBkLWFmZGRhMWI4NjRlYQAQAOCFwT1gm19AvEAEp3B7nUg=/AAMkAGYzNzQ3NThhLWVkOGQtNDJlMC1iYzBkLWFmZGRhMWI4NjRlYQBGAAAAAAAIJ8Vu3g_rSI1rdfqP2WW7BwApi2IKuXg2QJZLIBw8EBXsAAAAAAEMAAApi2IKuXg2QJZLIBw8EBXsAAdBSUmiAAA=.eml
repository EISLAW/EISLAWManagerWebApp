Everyone's using AI for transcription and summarization. But what if the re=
al revolution isn't in compressing our thoughts, but in expanding them? Wha=
t if we're using AI backwards? What if using AI differently is actually goo=
d for our brains?
This piece has been cooking for awhile. I=E2=80=99ve been trying to find a =
way to express something I think is really vital=E2=80=94how can we use AI =
more as a thinking partner, and less as a simple task-gopher. Like I want m=
y brain to work better with AI, not atrophy (thank you very much).
So this is a larger piece. It=E2=80=99s intentionally somewhat reflective. =
It challenges you to spend time with a really thoughtful insight on how you=
 use AI. And it has multiple learning modes. You can dig in on the video, o=
r if your thing is reading you can dive in on a larger piece that invites y=
ou to really marinate in the idea of using AI as a cognitive expander.
Why all the words? Nate get to the point! Because that is the point. Becaus=
e sometimes you need to marinate in an idea for awhile to really get it acr=
oss. There are definitely effective prompt frameworks (I write about them a=
 ton), but because our brains our unique this particular piece aims to give=
 you a map of AI-human partnership you can use as a guidebook to develop a =
way of working with AI that suits your brain. Yes, we=E2=80=99re gonna be t=
hat bold!
My whole goal with this Substack is to equip you with the tools to thrive i=
n the AI age, and I=E2=80=99ve been thinking more and more about how to nam=
e this weird new collaboration energy (or vibe [ https://substack.com/redir=
ect/a30d07a3-09b5-40d5-ac0a-b9657fb9ebb3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxP=
mLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]) that=E2=80=99s emerging, where we are =
working with AI not like our human colleagues, but also kinda like our huma=
n colleagues. I want to understand what about that dynamic helps us think b=
etter when it=E2=80=99s done well, so we can repeat it.
And I think I finally have something brain-expanding, something worth shari=
ng. So here goes! You=E2=80=99ll get research on neuroscience and thinking =
in here, but a ton more on how I actually am developing my own cognitive pa=
rtnership with AI, what it looks like for me, a little teaser on a book I=
=E2=80=99m developing, and a framework to start developing your own AI part=
nership. Would love to hear what you think of this one!
Subscribers get all these pieces!
First, The Science of Thinking=E2=80=94And How It Shapes Our Use of AI
Our brains aren't designed for compression=E2=80=94they're designed for exp=
loration. Neuroscience research reveals that deep, sustained thinking engag=
es sophisticated neural networks in ways that brief, efficient interactions=
 simply cannot. When we spend extended time with a subject, the frontoparie=
tal control network orchestrates with the default mode network, creating th=
e conditions for what researchers call "insight moments"=E2=80=94those brea=
kthrough realizations preceded by gamma-band neural activity that feel like=
 they come from nowhere but actually emerge from sustained cognitive engage=
ment. Walking enhances this process, boosting creative thinking by 81-100% =
through increased cerebral blood flow and norepinephrine activation. Deep r=
eading creates entirely new neural circuits. The brain needs time to marina=
te in complexity.
This is why the modern obsession with efficiency might be working against u=
s. When we compress information=E2=80=94summarizing books into bullet point=
s, meetings into action items, conversations into key takeaways=E2=80=94we'=
re systematically removing the very conditions our brains need for breakthr=
ough thinking. The neuroscience is clear: those meandering tangents, contra=
dictions, and recursive explorations aren't inefficiencies to be cleaned up=
=2E They're the mechanisms through whic=
h genuine insights emerge. Japanese co=
ntemplative traditions have long understood this through concepts like 'ma'=
=E2=80=94the meaningful space between thoughts where understanding develops=
 organically. Western research validates the same principle: Csikszentmihal=
yi's flow states and Cal Newport's deep work both demonstrate that our most=
 sophisticated thinking happens not through compression, but through sustai=
ned, uninterrupted engagement with complexity.
Which brings us to a profound irony in how we're using artificial intellige=
nce. We have access to the most sophisticated cognitive tools ever created,=
 yet we're primarily using them to compress and summarize=E2=80=94to spend =
less time thinking. But what if that's exactly backwards?
The Cognitive Revolution: Why We're Using AI Backwards
Everyone's using AI for transcription and summarization. But what if the re=
al revolution isn't in compressing our thoughts, but in expanding them? Wha=
t if we're using AI backwards?
Stay with me=E2=80=94this is worth it.
Don=E2=80=99t get me wrong. I=E2=80=99ve been firmly in the compression cam=
p, and I still find value in a lot of those compression-based AI activities=
: turn my meeting notes into clean outputs, transform product requirements =
docs into different versions for engineers versus executives, compress 100-=
page PDFs into something digestible. This reminds me that people send these=
 Substacks to AI (apparently) to compress them for a quick info snack.=20
Gradually that compression assumption has been challenged at the edges. I=
=E2=80=99ve been wrestling with how to express it for awhile, and I think I=
 finally got it. The key was a twenty-five minute conversation with ChatGPT=
's advanced voice mode about a book idea I'd been wrestling with. That=E2=
=80=99s when everything changed. Not because the AI gave me brilliant insig=
hts=E2=80=94sometimes I even told it "this is really meh, I don't love this=
=2E" What changed was my understanding=20=
of what AI could do beyond compression=
=2E
That conversation unlocked something I couldn't have accessed through any a=
mount of prompting or summarization. It revealed a fundamentally different =
way of thinking with AI=E2=80=94one that expands cognitive territory rather=
 than compressing it.
Now before we go further=E2=80=94this was not just me discovering I could t=
alk to AI. I=E2=80=99ve used voice mode for over a year now. And it=E2=80=
=99s been great! The difference now is understanding how I used multiple mo=
dels to work with my brain and help me enrich my thinking that felt revolut=
ionary. The key, I think, is getting to a level of fluency where I can be i=
ntentional with my cognitive architecture with AI as a partner.
This is also not me negging human partnerships and teams! This is a fundame=
ntally new experience. In my view it doesn=E2=80=99t replace excellent team=
work at all, but strengthens it (probably a separate post). Instead, we=E2=
=80=99re looking at finding words for a new way of working with our brains,=
 one we=E2=80=99ve never tried in 200,000 years=E2=80=A6
The Compression Trap We're All Stuck In
Walk into any office today and you'll see the exact same pattern everywhere=
: people feeding AI their messy, human thoughts and asking for clean, organ=
ized outputs. We've collectively decided that AI's highest value is being o=
ur cognitive janitor=E2=80=94cleaning up the inherent messiness of human th=
inking.
Here's what we're actually doing when we use AI for compression: we're taki=
ng the non-linear, contradictory, tangential way our brains naturally work =
and asking AI to clean it up into neat packages. We're systematically remov=
ing exactly the parts of our thinking where breakthrough insights actually =
live.
The brain doesn't process compressed information the same way it processes =
the full, complex version. When you read a deep book on a big subject, the =
learning comes from your brain forming new connections as it spends extende=
d time marinating in the material. You can get a very good one-page summary=
 of that book=E2=80=94you will get a precise executive briefing on the cont=
ent=E2=80=94but you're unlikely to have the kind of life-changing experienc=
e you'd get from actually diving deep and letting your brain work through t=
he full complexity.
This compression obsession makes intuitive sense. Human thinking is notorio=
usly chaotic. We contradict ourselves, go on tangents, repeat ideas in slig=
htly different forms, and generally make a mess of linear communication. AI=
, with its ability to find patterns and impose structure, seems like the pe=
rfect solution to our cognitive disorder.
But here's what we're missing: that "messiness" isn't a bug in human cognit=
ion=E2=80=94it's a feature. The tangents, contradictions, and recursive exp=
loration aren't inefficiencies to be cleaned up. They're the very mechanism=
s through which breakthrough thinking emerges.
Consider how most people use voice-to-text AI. They speak carefully, trying=
 to produce something that will transcribe into clean, readable text. They =
self-edit as they talk, avoiding the natural meandering of speech in favor =
of something that looks good on the page. They're using one of the most sop=
histicated cognitive tools ever created as a glorified stenographer.
Or think about how we use AI for meeting summaries. We extract action items=
, key decisions, and important announcements=E2=80=94all the "productive" c=
ontent. But we throw away the exploratory discussions, the questions that d=
idn't get answered, the tangents that revealed unspoken assumptions. We kee=
p the conclusions and discard the thinking process that generated them.
This compression paradigm has turned AI into an efficiency engine for indus=
trial-era thinking. We're using tools capable of superhuman reasoning to ma=
ke our existing thought patterns more streamlined. It's like using a spacec=
raft to make your morning commute faster instead of exploring new worlds.
There are people who will take this insight and say AI is the problem. I ac=
tually think the way we use it is the problem. Not that it's bad to use it =
for compression=E2=80=94I too use it for adjusting my meeting notes, I too =
use it for sending different messages to different stakeholders for routine=
 business communication. But if you need to do really deep thinking, you ne=
ed to spend time on a subject. You need to optimize your cognitive workload=
 to enable you to do your best thinking.
And AI can actually help with that. But not through compression.
The Backwards Realization
The shift in my perspective came during what I thought would be a routine c=
reative session. I'd been wrestling with a book concept for months=E2=80=94=
something about AI and cognition that felt important but remained frustrati=
ngly elusive. Every time I tried to outline it, I hit the same wall: I coul=
d sense there was something significant there, but I couldn't articulate wh=
at.
Writing a book is exponentially harder than writing articles. It needs to b=
e useful, especially with AI moving so fast, and some of the challenges inc=
lude having something that stands the test of time. When I'm contemplating =
a project like this, the thing that's most difficult isn't information comp=
ression. I already get plenty of AI news, trust me. It's that I need to wor=
k with AI in a way that helps my brain expand and kick around the subject m=
atter.
And we don't really optimize for that when we only talk about prompting, be=
cause prompting really optimizes for one-way communication. Learning how to=
 prompt well is a skill, but it's sort of like learning to ride a bicycle v=
ersus learning to drive a car. Both are helpful. The car is going to take y=
ou farther if you learn how to do it well. And I think increasingly, prompt=
ing is like the bicycle skill. It's incredibly efficient if you master it. =
Everybody should know how to do it. It should be a universal skill. I do th=
ink we're going to need it for a while, and it provides a durable edge if y=
ou can prompt well.
But if you can learn to actually cognitively partner beyond an individual p=
rompt with AI, that's like driving a car. That's actually going farther.
On this particular afternoon, instead of opening a blank document and forci=
ng myself to write, I did something different. I opened ChatGPT's advanced =
voice mode with no agenda other than to think out loud about this nebulous =
book idea.
The Voice Mode Discovery
What followed was twenty-five minutes of the kind of meandering, contradict=
ory, tangential thinking that I would normally edit out of any professional=
 communication. I found myself exploring connections I didn't know I was ma=
king, questioning assumptions I didn't realize I held, and following intell=
ectual threads that seemed to lead nowhere and everywhere simultaneously.
It would let me talk out loud for a while. It actually listened, it actuall=
y took notes, and it actually responded with just enough interest, engageme=
nt, and riffing to keep my brain flowing so I could keep the ideas coming. =
Because I had an idea that I wanted to talk out, and I knew I couldn't just=
 dictate into a transcription device for twenty-five minutes and get it. Bu=
t if I had someone talk back to me in the right cadence, I'd probably be ab=
le to fish it out of my brain because we're conversational people.
The AI didn't try to organize my thoughts or push me toward conclusions. In=
stead, it asked questions that pulled at the edges of what I was saying, re=
sponded to nuances in my tone that even I wasn't fully conscious of, and cr=
eated a conversational space where half-formed ideas could exist without im=
mediate judgment.
Advanced voice mode has really gotten better since they shipped that update=
 that makes it more aware of when it interrupts you. It uses more discontin=
uities verbally, like "and" and "um." It just sounds more natural and allow=
s you to forget it's there and just focus on the subject, which is what I n=
eeded to do.
I wasn't dictating to be transcribed. I wasn't explaining ideas I already u=
nderstood. I was genuinely thinking through voice, using the AI as a cognit=
ive collaborator in real-time exploration. And something remarkable happene=
d: ideas began emerging that I literally could not have thought without thi=
s collaborative dynamic.
The experience was like a cross between the way a therapist listens to you =
and the way a good colleague listens to you. And you'd never expect a human=
 to do that, but it's super helpful for your thinking. I've worked in offic=
es, right? I've worked in person with teams. I love that dynamic. I don't w=
ant it to go away when we work well together with good human colleagues. Bu=
t it's not the same as a good AI colleague=E2=80=94an AI colleague that you=
 can brainstorm with in that way where they listen and just riff with you.
When you're talking out loud like this, you're sort of naming the work as y=
ou go. And that's part of the cognitive journey that we've kept inside our =
heads for 200,000 years, and now we have a partner to do it with. It's true=
 that sometimes if you did paired work together with humans, you could kind=
 of get to this. But I actually think it's a distinct dynamic with AI.
When the conversation ended, I had a transcript=E2=80=94but that transcript=
 wasn't the valuable output. It was just the raw material for what came nex=
t.
The Terrain-Mapping Discovery
Instead of asking AI to clean up that rambling conversation, I took it to o=
3 with a completely different kind of request. I literally pulled the trans=
cript out into a Google Doc and stuck it into o3 as a raw transcript, and I=
 said: "This is a transcript. This is my perspective on the transcript. Thi=
s was the intent I had with this idea. Really help me get to a crystal-clea=
r understanding of the heart of the idea."
What came back transformed my understanding of what had happened during tha=
t voice session=E2=80=94and what AI could do beyond compression.
o3 didn't give me a summary. It gave me what I now think of as a cognitive =
x-ray of my thinking process. It identified conceptual clusters I hadn't co=
nsciously formed, traced thematic threads across seemingly unrelated tangen=
ts, and surfaced the implicit framework that had been guiding my exploratio=
n. It showed me the underlying architecture of ideas that my meandering con=
versation had been unconsciously constructing.
This is where I iteratively arrived, because I find that a lot of times whe=
n you're talking out loud, you're sort of naming the work as you go. The AI=
 had mapped the topology of my thinking=E2=80=94revealing not just what I h=
ad said, but the conceptual landscape I had been navigating. It identified =
tensions between ideas I had been exploring, highlighted assumptions that w=
ere shaping my thinking, and revealed connections that had been operating b=
elow the level of conscious awareness.
And honestly, it's not just o3. I don't want to just rep OpenAI here, right=
? You can go and do this in Claude Opus, the new Claude 4 model. You could =
do this in Gemini 2.0 Pro. You'd get similar results. The idea is you want =
a model that can think deeply and critique the results that you get from th=
e voice conversation.
Suddenly, I could see the book's structure=E2=80=94not the one I thought I =
was trying to write, but the one I was actually discovering through the pro=
cess of exploratory conversation. The cognitive map o3 created showed me th=
at my seemingly scattered thoughts had been exploring a coherent conceptual=
 territory. I just hadn't been able to see the shape of that territory from=
 ground level.
This wasn't summarization or organization. It was reconnaissance of cogniti=
ve space. o3 had revealed the hidden geography of my own thinking.
The Three Levels of Model-Specific Cognitive Work
What emerged gradually (slowly!) from this experience was the recognition t=
hat I had stumbled into a fundamentally different approach to AI collaborat=
ion=E2=80=94one that operates at three distinct levels, each requiring diff=
erent models and unlocking different types of cognitive capability.
Level One: Expansive Conversation Through Voice
Advanced voice mode isn't just convenient=E2=80=94it's cognitively transfor=
mative. When you speak your thoughts instead of writing them, you access wh=
at I call "curious naming"=E2=80=94the process of giving voice to ideas tha=
t don't yet have proper names, exploring concepts that exist in the spaces =
between established categories.
This isn't about dictation or transcription. It's about using the real-time=
 conversational flow to discover thoughts you didn't know you were thinking=
=2E The AI becomes a thinking partne=
r, responding to prosodic cues=E2=80=94to=
ne, pace, hesitation=E2=80=94that carry meaning beyond the literal content =
of your words.
The key insight is that voice mode creates a fundamentally different cognit=
ive state than text mode. When you're typing, you're constantly editing, re=
vising, organizing thoughts into presentable form. This editorial process, =
while valuable, also constrains the kinds of thoughts that can emerge. You =
tend toward ideas that can be clearly articulated, that fit established pat=
terns, that make immediate sense.
But when you're speaking, especially in an exploratory conversation, you ca=
n't edit as you go. You have to trust the process. You follow tangents that=
 would seem inefficient in writing. You repeat yourself until clarity emerg=
es. You contradict earlier statements as your thinking evolves in real-time=
=2E You explore ideas that feel half-formed or embarrassingly unpolished.
This isn't sloppy thinking=E2=80=94it's expansive thinking. It's accessing =
the cognitive modes we use when we're genuinely trying to understand someth=
ing new, rather than when we're trying to communicate something we already =
understand.
The conversational AI becomes crucial because it can track these exploratio=
ns, ask questions that pull at interesting threads, and create the kind of =
intellectual scaffolding that allows you to venture into less certain conce=
ptual territory. It's not trying to help you get to a predetermined destina=
tion=E2=80=94it's helping you explore territory you didn't know existed.
I've started thinking of this as "collaborative wandering." You're not wand=
ering aimlessly, but you're also not following a predetermined path. You're=
 exploring with purpose but without fixed destination, trusting that the to=
pology of the intellectual landscape will guide you toward interesting disc=
overies.
The magic happens when you realize you're genuinely thinking through conver=
sation rather than just talking about thoughts you've already formed. The A=
I creates space for ideas to emerge that couldn't exist in isolation, ideas=
 that need the dynamic of real-time response and exploration to crystallize=
=2E
Level Two: Cognitive Terrain-Mapping with Advanced Reasoning
Once you have that raw, expansive conversation, you need a different kind o=
f intelligence to make sense of it. This is where o3's advanced reasoning c=
apabilities become transformative=E2=80=94but only if you approach it as a =
cognitive cartographer rather than a traditional summarizer.
The breakthrough happens when you realize you're not asking o3 to tell you =
what you said. You're asking it to show you what you were thinking about wi=
thout knowing you were thinking about it. The model's sophisticated reasoni=
ng allows it to work backwards from your voiced thoughts to the underlying =
conceptual framework that was unconsciously guiding your exploration.
This requires what I call "terrain-mapping prompts"=E2=80=94requests that a=
sk the AI to reveal the hidden geography of your thinking rather than simpl=
y organizing its surface content. Instead of "summarize this conversation,"=
 you might ask:
"Take my intent, take what I was able to articulate, take the riffing that =
advanced voice mode did, and help me get to a crystal-clear understanding o=
f the heart of the idea. Map the conceptual territory I was exploring. What=
 were the central tensions I was working with? What assumptions were shapin=
g my thinking? What connections was I making between seemingly unrelated id=
eas? What framework was implicitly guiding my exploration?"
The results are revelatory. o3 can identify patterns across your entire con=
versation that you weren't consciously creating. It can trace how your thin=
king moved through conceptual space, highlighting moments where you shifted=
 between different levels of abstraction, identifying places where you circ=
led back to refine earlier ideas, and surfacing the implicit logic that con=
nected your various explorations.
This isn't traditional analysis, which typically breaks things down into co=
mponents. This is emergence recognition=E2=80=94identifying the higher-orde=
r patterns and structures that emerge from complex thinking processes.
What makes o3 particularly powerful for this work is its ability to hold mu=
ltiple contradictory ideas in productive tension rather than immediately re=
solving them into simplified conclusions. Human thinking is often dialectic=
al=E2=80=94we explore ideas by entertaining contradictions, examining tensi=
ons, and allowing complexity to exist without immediate resolution. o3 can =
map this dialectical landscape without flattening it into false simplicity.
The cognitive map it creates becomes a powerful tool for further thinking. =
You can see which areas of your conceptual territory are well-developed and=
 which remain unexplored. You can identify where your thinking is most cohe=
rent and where it might benefit from further investigation. You can recogni=
ze patterns in how you approach complex problems and develop strategies for=
 leveraging your natural cognitive tendencies more effectively.
As a specific example, I thought o3 did a good job getting to the heart of =
the thesis for the book. I thought the outline felt a little bit heavy, so =
I need to go into a different model. I'll probably choose Claude Opus for t=
his to start to refine what that looks like a little bit more. I need to pi=
ck a different cognitive partner.
Level Three: Model-Specific Cognitive Partnerships
Here's where most people stop, but it's actually where the real transformat=
ion begins. Once you've used voice mode for expansive exploration and o3 fo=
r terrain-mapping, you need to develop what I call "model-specific cognitiv=
e partnerships"=E2=80=94understanding how different AI models can serve as =
cognitive collaborators for different types of thinking work.
This goes far beyond prompt engineering or learning to use tools more effec=
tively. It's about understanding that different models have different cogni=
tive strengths and learning to choreograph collaborations that amplify your=
 thinking in unprecedented ways.
If you're wondering how I pick models, I put a whole framework up on Substa=
ck [ https://substack.com/redirect/022d51a7-b02a-4aea-a0c2-a0739ee7b92e?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] about =
how I choose models for different tasks. But the core insight is this: you'=
re not just selecting tools=E2=80=94you're choosing thinking partners. And =
different partners enable different kinds of cognitive work.
Claude Opus, for instance, is excellent for shaping ideas and really thinki=
ng through concepts. It's particularly good at maintaining nuance and explo=
ring the implications of complex frameworks. If I need to refine the struct=
ural thinking around my book outline, Opus is my go-to choice.
o3 excels at analytical reasoning and pattern recognition across complex in=
formation. It's brilliant for mapping cognitive terrain and identifying con=
nections that aren't immediately obvious. But it might not be the best choi=
ce for creative exploration or nuanced conceptual development.
GPT-4o in voice mode creates space for expansive, exploratory thinking. It'=
s excellent for the kind of meandering conversation that allows ideas to em=
erge organically. But you wouldn't want to use it for detailed analytical w=
ork that requires sustained reasoning.
The art lies in understanding these different cognitive signatures (and lot=
s of others) and learning to sequence them effectively. You might start wit=
h voice mode for exploration, move to o3 for analysis, then shift to Opus f=
or conceptual refinement, and finally return to voice mode for further crea=
tive development.
But this isn't just about using different models sequentially. It's about d=
eveloping distinctly human cognitive capabilities that create exponential v=
alue when paired with specific AI models.
With voice mode, you develop the skill of productive meandering=E2=80=94lea=
rning to trust tangential thinking and follow conceptual scents without imm=
ediate judgment. This requires cultivating intellectual courage: the willin=
gness to sound incoherent while you're working toward coherence, to contrad=
ict yourself as your thinking evolves, to explore ideas that might lead now=
here.
You also develop conversational thinking=E2=80=94the ability to use dialogu=
e as a primary cognitive mode rather than just a communication tool. This m=
eans learning to think with and through another intelligence, allowing the =
conversational dynamic to shape the direction of your exploration rather th=
an trying to control it.
With o3, you develop terrain-reading=E2=80=94the ability to recognize and w=
ork with the cognitive maps it creates. This involves learning to see your =
own thinking from a meta-cognitive perspective, to recognize patterns in ho=
w you explore complex ideas, and to identify the implicit frameworks that g=
uide your intellectual investigation.
With models like Opus, you develop architectural thinking=E2=80=94the abili=
ty to see the structural relationships between ideas rather than just their=
 surface content. This allows you to work with the conceptual scaffolding t=
hat reasoning models reveal, using it as a foundation for further intellect=
ual construction.
The Cognitive Choreography Framework
So let=E2=80=99s put this together. How can we make a wandering conversatio=
n into something that=E2=80=99s more of a stable frame?
What emerged from my discovery session wasn't just a book outline=E2=80=94I=
 think it=E2=80=99s more of a replicable approach to cognitive collaboratio=
n with AI. I call it "cognitive choreography" because it involves orchestra=
ting different types of intelligence in sequence to create thinking experie=
nces that transcend what any single intelligence could achieve alone.
The framework operates on a fundamental inversion of the typical AI workflo=
w. Instead of starting with clear objectives and using AI to achieve them m=
ore efficiently, you start with curiosity and use AI to discover objectives=
 you didn't know you had. Instead of beginning with problems and seeking so=
lutions, you begin with exploration and allow problems to emerge from the l=
andscape of possibility.
Here's how the choreography typically unfolds:
Phase 1: Expansive Exploration You begin with advanced voice mode and a gen=
uine sense of curiosity about some domain, problem, or idea. The key is to =
resist the urge to have a clear agenda. Instead, you enter what I call "col=
laborative wandering"=E2=80=94exploratory conversation that follows intelle=
ctual scents wherever they lead.
This phase is about cognitive expansion rather than problem-solving. You're=
 not trying to reach conclusions; you're trying to discover what you're cur=
ious about. You're not trying to organize your thoughts; you're trying to e=
xplore the territory those thoughts inhabit.
The AI's role is to be an intellectual interlocutor=E2=80=94asking question=
s that pull at interesting threads, highlighting tensions or contradictions=
 in your thinking, and creating the kind of conversational space where half=
-formed ideas can develop without immediate evaluation.
The goal is to generate what I call "cognitive raw material"=E2=80=94the ki=
nd of expansive, unedited thinking that contains possibilities you couldn't=
 access through traditional planning or outlining approaches.
Phase 2: Terrain Recognition Once you have a rich exploratory conversation,=
 you shift to a reasoning model like o3 for cognitive terrain-mapping. This=
 isn't summarization or organization=E2=80=94it's reconnaissance. You're as=
king the AI to reveal the hidden geography of your thinking, to show you th=
e conceptual landscape you've been navigating unconsciously.
This phase is about pattern recognition at the meta-cognitive level. The re=
asoning model identifies the implicit frameworks guiding your exploration, =
reveals connections you were making without realizing it, and surfaces the =
underlying architecture of your thinking about the domain.
The output isn't a summary or action plan=E2=80=94it's a cognitive map. You=
 can see which areas of the conceptual territory you've explored thoroughly=
 and which remain terra incognita. You can identify the central tensions or=
 questions that are shaping your thinking. You can recognize the assumption=
s and frameworks that are operating below the level of conscious awareness.
This is where you define the coordinates of the terrain that you're in, now=
 that you've named the work. Once you do that, the sky becomes the limit fo=
r understanding what kinds of partnership dynamics work from here.
Phase 3: Strategic Development With the cognitive map in hand, you can begi=
n more intentional intellectual construction. Now you know the shape of the=
 territory you're working in. You can identify which areas merit further ex=
ploration, which tensions are most productive to maintain, and which connec=
tions deserve to be developed into more robust theoretical structures.
This phase involves strategic model selection based on the specific cogniti=
ve work you need to do. If you need creative exploration of a particular ar=
ea, you might return to voice mode. If you need rigorous analysis of specif=
ic tensions, you might use o3. If you need nuanced conceptual development, =
you might choose Claude Opus.
The key insight is that different models enable different kinds of thinking=
, and part of cognitive choreography is learning to match the right model t=
o the right cognitive task.
Phase 4: Integration and Application The final phase involves taking the in=
sights and frameworks you've developed through this process and applying th=
em to concrete challenges or opportunities. But because this framework has =
emerged from genuine exploration of your own thinking rather than being imp=
osed from external sources, the integration tends to be much more natural a=
nd powerful.
You're not trying to apply someone else's framework to your situation=E2=80=
=94you're working with conceptual architecture that has emerged from your o=
wn cognitive landscape. The thinking tools you develop feel native because =
they are native. They've grown out of your own intellectual exploration rat=
her than being borrowed from elsewhere.
Beyond the Tool-Use Paradigm
What makes this approach revolutionary isn't the efficiency gains=E2=80=94i=
t's the emergence of entirely new forms of cognition. We're not just using =
AI to think faster or more accurately; we're using it to think in ways that=
 weren't previously possible.
This represents a fundamental shift from the tool-use paradigm to what I ca=
ll "cognitive symbiosis." Instead of delegating cognitive work to machines,=
 we're discovering new forms of cognitive work that can only exist in colla=
boration with machines.
Consider how this changes strategic thinking. Instead of starting with fram=
eworks and filling in details, you begin with exploratory conversation abou=
t the strategic landscape, map the cognitive terrain that emerges, and then=
 develop strategies that align with the natural architecture of your thinki=
ng about the challenge. The result isn't just better strategy=E2=80=94it's =
strategy that emerges from a more complete understanding of your own concep=
tual relationship to the problem space.
Think about creative work. Instead of brainstorming and then organizing, yo=
u explore through voice, discover the hidden connections reasoning models r=
eveal, and then develop creative directions that honor the full complexity =
of your imaginative terrain. You're not just generating more ideas=E2=80=94=
you're accessing ideas that exist in the spaces between your conscious thou=
ghts.
The same pattern applies to research, problem-solving, learning, and virtua=
lly any cognitive activity that benefits from exploration and discovery. By=
 inverting the traditional compress-then-apply workflow, you unlock cogniti=
ve capabilities that simply don't exist within the efficiency paradigm.
I wouldn't ask a human to do the kind of listening that I asked advanced vo=
ice mode to do. I also wouldn't really ask a human to work on sharpening my=
 thesis for an outline the way I would ask o3 to do it. I wouldn't ask a hu=
man to go and necessarily do the research and do the thinking and the, for =
lack of a better term, cognitive shaping on the thesis with me. It's not ju=
st doing it on its own=E2=80=94that I would ask of Claude Opus. Opus is gre=
at for shaping ideas and really thinking through concepts.
These are genuinely different cognitive partnerships, each optimized for di=
fferent types of thinking work.
The Landscape of Possibility
As I've experimented with this framework a bit, I've started to see AI not =
as a collection of tools for existing cognitive tasks, but as an invitation=
 to develop new forms of human intelligence.
Each new AI capability doesn't just make us more efficient=E2=80=94it creat=
es opportunities for cognitive evolution. Advanced voice mode doesn't just =
make communication easier; it enables new forms of exploratory thinking. o3=
 doesn't just provide better analysis; it reveals new ways of understanding=
 the structure of human cognition itself.
The leaders who will thrive in this landscape won't be those who get the be=
st results from AI=E2=80=94they'll be those who develop the most sophistica=
ted cognitive capabilities for thinking with AI. They'll treat each new mod=
el not as a better tool, but as an invitation to expand their own intellect=
ual repertoire.
This requires a fundamental shift in how we think about human-AI collaborat=
ion. Instead of asking "How can AI help me do what I already do better?" we=
 need to ask "What new forms of thinking become possible when human and art=
ificial intelligence collaborate?"
The answer to that question is still emerging, but the early experiments ar=
e extraordinarily promising. We're discovering that the real power of AI is=
n't in replacing human thinking, but in creating cognitive partnerships tha=
t enable forms of intelligence that neither humans nor machines could achie=
ve alone.
I'm finding that my brain is able to think better by spending more time wit=
h AI models if they're carefully modulated. It's not just throwing prompts =
in there. There's no secret prompt to this. It's deciding the kind of task =
I need and then making sure that I approach AI and ask myself: what is the =
model that I can choose that will most help me to optimize for getting my b=
rain deeply into the subject matter so that I become someone who truly unde=
rstands it?
That in and of itself is opposed to=E2=80=94it's antithetical to=E2=80=94th=
is idea that AI lets you go cheap on your brain, right? It lets you skip th=
e brain power. It lets you not do the work. It lets you read the one-page s=
ummary instead of the full book.
I don't think it has to. I think it can actually help you to think better. =
I find it does, but it's how you use it.
The Personal Cognitive Infrastructure
What excites me most about this discovery isn't the immediate applications=
=E2=80=94it's the cognitive infrastructure it creates. Once you develop the=
se model-specific thinking capabilities, every subsequent interaction with =
AI becomes more generative.
You start to approach problems with the knowledge that you can think your w=
ay into them through voice, map the cognitive territory with reasoning mode=
ls, and develop solutions that emerge from the architecture of the problem =
itself. You develop intellectual confidence to tackle more complex and ambi=
guous challenges because you have sophisticated tools for making sense of c=
omplexity and ambiguity.
This creates a positive feedback loop. As your cognitive capabilities expan=
d, you become able to engage with more sophisticated challenges. As you eng=
age with more sophisticated challenges, your cognitive capabilities continu=
e to evolve. The partnership with AI becomes a platform for ongoing intelle=
ctual development rather than just a tool for solving immediate problems.
I've started thinking of this as "cognitive infrastructure"=E2=80=94the fou=
ndational capabilities that enable more sophisticated thinking rather than =
just more efficient execution of existing thought patterns. Just as physica=
l infrastructure enables forms of economic activity that wouldn't otherwise=
 be possible, cognitive infrastructure enables forms of intellectual activi=
ty that transcend what individuals or organizations could achieve with trad=
itional cognitive tools.
Part of why there's no magic prompt for this is our brains are wired pretty=
 uniquely. The way I choose to walk around and talk and talk my ideas out l=
oud may not work for everybody. There are people for whom they need to writ=
e it out by hand, take a picture of it, get a transcription, and maybe that=
's the way they start.
I think your mileage is going to vary because your brain varies, but the co=
ncept of optimizing for having your brain in the subject is something that =
allows us to view AI as an expander, not just as a compression tool. It's s=
omething that optimizes for what we can create, not just how we can cut cos=
ts by compressing information, even if that's useful.
A Practical Protocol for Getting Started
If you want to begin experimenting with this approach, here's a detailed pr=
otocol that captures the essential elements:
Choose Your Territory Start with something you're genuinely curious about b=
ut can't quite articulate. This could be a strategic challenge you're facin=
g, a creative project you've been considering, or an intellectual question =
that's been nagging at you. The key is to choose something where you sense =
there's more than meets the eye=E2=80=94where you suspect your current unde=
rstanding is incomplete or oversimplified.
Don't pick something you already understand well or something you just need=
 to execute efficiently. The sweet spot is ideas that feel important but re=
main frustratingly elusive when you try to think about them in traditional =
ways.
Enter Exploratory Mode Open advanced voice mode with no agenda other than t=
o think out loud about your chosen territory. Resist the urge to have clear=
 talking points or objectives. Instead, begin with whatever feels most aliv=
e or interesting about the topic and let the conversation evolve organicall=
y.
Spend at least fifteen minutes=E2=80=94preferably longer=E2=80=94in genuine=
 exploratory conversation. Follow tangents. Contradict yourself. Ask questi=
ons you don't know how to answer. Allow the AI to ask questions that pull a=
t the edges of your thinking. The goal isn't to reach conclusions but to di=
scover what you're curious about.
Pay attention to moments when you find yourself saying things you didn't kn=
ow you were thinking. Notice when the conversation takes unexpected turns o=
r when you circle back to ideas with new perspective. These are signs that =
the exploratory process is working.
Map the Terrain Take the transcript to o3 (or the most advanced reasoning m=
odel available to you) and ask it to map the cognitive terrain you've explo=
red. Don't ask for summaries or action items=E2=80=94ask for patterns, conn=
ections, tensions, and the underlying conceptual architecture.
Try prompts like: "This is a transcript of an exploratory conversation. Hel=
p me understand the cognitive territory I was exploring. What were the cent=
ral tensions or questions I was working with? What connections was I making=
 between different ideas? What assumptions or frameworks were implicitly gu=
iding my thinking? What patterns emerged that I might not have consciously =
recognized?"
The key is to approach this as reconnaissance rather than organization. You=
're not trying to clean up your thinking=E2=80=94you're trying to understan=
d its natural topology.
Read the Map Spend time with the cognitive map the reasoning model creates.=
 Learn to recognize the topology of your own thinking. Identify areas that =
feel well-developed and areas that seem to call for further exploration. No=
tice patterns in how you approach complex questions. Look for tensions that=
 might be productive to maintain rather than immediately resolve.
This is often where the most surprising insights emerge. You might discover=
 that your thinking has been operating with assumptions you weren't aware o=
f, or that you've been exploring connections that only become visible when =
mapped by advanced reasoning capabilities.
Develop the Territory Use the map as a guide for further exploration. Retur=
n to voice mode to investigate specific areas that seem promising. Use reas=
oning models to analyze particular tensions or connections in greater depth=
=2E Gradually build more sophisticated=20=
understanding of the territory you're=20=
exploring.
This phase often involves cycling between different models and different ty=
pes of cognitive work. You might explore creatively with voice mode, analyz=
e with O3, refine conceptually with Claude Opus, then return to voice mode =
for further creative development.
Apply the Architecture Once you've developed a richer understanding of your=
 chosen territory, begin applying the insights and frameworks you've discov=
ered to concrete challenges or opportunities. But remember=E2=80=94you're n=
ot imposing external frameworks; you're working with conceptual architectur=
e that has emerged from your own cognitive exploration.
The application phase often feels surprisingly natural because you're worki=
ng with ideas that have grown organically from your own thinking rather tha=
n being borrowed from external sources.
The Competitive Advantage of Cognitive Expansion
The value I get from AI=E2=80=94and yes, I'm a Pro subscriber, I pay my $20=
0 a month=E2=80=94is so much greater when I use it this way. Not everyone n=
eeds to pay that much to get value, but whatever your investment level, the=
 returns are higher when you optimize for brain time on subject versus just=
 compressing and repurposing information.
Most companies I see that aren't super fluent in AI end up using it primari=
ly for compression and repurposing information. That's fine=E2=80=94there a=
re cost savings there. But helping your brain work better has so much more =
upside over time, and we talk about it way less than we should.
We're at risk of getting so deep into the compression trap that we don't ex=
plore this other possibility: that AI can help us map and expand the cognit=
ive territory we work in by partnering with us in ways that are somewhat re=
miniscent of human collaboration, but also distinct.
The companies and individuals who will create sustainable competitive advan=
tage won't be those who get the most compression efficiency from AI. They'l=
l be the ones who figure out how to use AI to think better, deeper, and mor=
e creatively about the problems that actually matter.
This requires a fundamental shift from asking "How can AI do this work for =
me?" to asking "How can AI help me do better thinking about this work?"
The difference is profound. The first question leads to delegation and comp=
ression. The second leads to partnership and expansion.
It's about knowing when to sort of pull the thinking button and say, "I wan=
t to use this to actually expand my time thinking about this because this i=
s really important. This is work that needs and deserves the cream of my br=
ain, and I need to orient my approach to AI so that I can spend more time m=
arinating on this in a way that works for my brain."
The Revolution in Progress
We're living through a cognitive revolution, but most people are still usin=
g revolutionary tools to do evolutionary work. They're making their existin=
g thinking more efficient instead of discovering what new forms of thinking=
 become possible.
The transformation happens when you realize that the most powerful insights=
 emerge not from what AI knows, but from what it helps you discover about y=
our own thinking. The real revolution isn't in compression or automation=E2=
=80=94it's in expansion and exploration.
My twenty-five-minute conversation didn't just unlock a book idea=E2=80=94i=
t unlocked a fundamentally different relationship with my own cognition. It=
 showed me that the thoughts I can think in collaboration with AI are quali=
tatively different from the thoughts I can think alone. And that's just the=
 beginning of what becomes possible when we stop using AI backwards.
The question isn't whether AI will change how we think=E2=80=94it already i=
s. The question is whether we'll evolve our cognitive capabilities fast eno=
ugh to take full advantage of the opportunities that transformation creates=
=2E
Thinking about this was helpful for me. I hope it kind of turns the wheels =
for you, maybe helps you think about AI a bit differently.
What ideas have you been carrying around that deserve more than quick compr=
ession? What would happen if you optimized for brain time on subject instea=
d of brain time saved? What new forms of intelligence might emerge when you=
 begin treating AI not as a tool for efficiency, but as a partner for disco=
very?

 of AI</h1><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Our brains aren't designed for compression=
=E2=80=94they're designed for exploration.</strong><span> Neuroscience rese=
arch reveals that deep, sustained thinking engages sophisticated neural net=
works in ways that brief, efficient interactions simply cannot. When we spe=
nd extended time with a subject, the frontoparietal control network orchest=
rates with the default mode network, creating the conditions for what resea=
rchers call &quot;insight moments&quot;=E2=80=94those breakthrough realizat=
ions preceded by gamma-band neural activity that feel like they come from n=
owhere but actually emerge from sustained cognitive engagement. Walking enh=
ances this process, boosting creative thinking by 81-100% through increased=
 cerebral blood flow and norepinephrine activation. Deep reading creates en=
tirely new neural circuits. The brain needs time to marinate in complexity.=
</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;">This is why the modern obsession with efficiency mi=
ght be working against us. When we compress information=E2=80=94summarizing=
 books into bullet points, meetings into action items, conversations into k=
ey takeaways=E2=80=94we're systematically removing the very conditions our =
brains need for breakthrough thinking. The neuroscience is clear: those mea=
ndering tangents, contradictions, and recursive explorations aren't ineffic=
iencies to be cleaned up. They're the mechanisms through which genuine insi=
ghts emerge. Japanese contemplative traditions have long understood this th=
rough concepts like 'ma'=E2=80=94the meaningful space between thoughts wher=
e understanding develops organically. Western research validates the same p=
rinciple: Csikszentmihalyi's flow states and Cal Newport's deep work both d=
emonstrate that our most sophisticated thinking happens not through compres=
sion, but through sustained, uninterrupted engagement with complexity.</p><=
p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-s=
ize: 16px;">Which brings us to a profound irony in how we're using artifici=
al intelligence. We have access to the most sophisticated cognitive tools e=
ver created, yet we're primarily using them to compress and summarize=E2=80=

his compression obsession makes intuitive sense. Human thinking is notoriou=
sly chaotic. We contradict ourselves, go on tangents, repeat ideas in sligh=

looks good on the page. They're using one of the most sophisticated cogniti=

ifferent cognitive state than text mode. When you're typing, you're constan=

you what you were thinking about without knowing you were thinking about it=

 identifying places where you circled back to refine earlier ideas, and sur=

t in how we think about human-AI collaboration. Instead of asking &quot;How=
 can AI help me do what I already do better?&quot; we need to ask &quot;Wha=
t new forms of thinking become possible when human and artificial intellige=

 emerging, but the early experiments are extraordinarily promising. We're d=
iscovering that the real power of AI isn't in replacing human thinking, but=
 in creating cognitive partnerships that enable forms of intelligence that =
neither humans nor machines could achieve alone.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0=

s if they're carefully modulated. It's not just throwing prompts in there. =
There's no secret prompt to this. It's deciding the kind of task I need and=
 then making sure that I approach AI and ask myself: what is the model that=
 I can choose that will most help me to optimize for getting my brain deepl=

every subsequent interaction with AI becomes more generative.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

our way into them through voice, map the cognitive territory with reasoning=
 models, and develop solutions that emerge from the architecture of the pro=
blem itself. You develop intellectual confidence to tackle more complex and=
 ambiguous challenges because you have sophisticated tools for making sense=
 of complexity and ambiguity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=

with more sophisticated challenges. As you engage with more sophisticated c=
hallenges, your cognitive capabilities continue to evolve. The partnership =
with AI becomes a platform for ongoing intellectual development rather than=
 just a tool for solving immediate problems.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20p=

 more efficient execution of existing thought patterns. Just as physical in=

cal Protocol for Getting Started</strong></h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">If you want to b=
egin experimenting with this approach, here's a detailed protocol that capt=
ures the essential elements:</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Choose Your Territory<=
/strong><span> Start with something you're genuinely curious about but can'=
t quite articulate. This could be a strategic challenge you're facing, a cr=
eative project you've been considering, or an intellectual question that's =
been nagging at you. The key is to choose something where you sense there's=
 more than meets the eye=E2=80=94where you suspect your current understandi=
ng is incomplete or oversimplified.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px =
0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Don't pick somet=
hing you already understand well or something you just need to execute effi=
ciently. The sweet spot is ideas that feel important but remain frustrating=
ly elusive when you try to think about them in traditional ways.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;"><strong>Enter Exploratory Mode</strong><span> Open advanced voice mod=
e with no agenda other than to think out loud about your chosen territory. =
Resist the urge to have clear talking points or objectives. Instead, begin =
with whatever feels most alive or interesting about the topic and let the c=
onversation evolve organically.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Spend at least fifte=
en minutes=E2=80=94preferably longer=E2=80=94in genuine exploratory convers=
ation. Follow tangents. Contradict yourself. Ask questions you don't know h=
ow to answer. Allow the AI to ask questions that pull at the edges of your =
thinking. The goal isn't to reach conclusions but to discover what you're c=
urious about.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-h=
eight: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Pay attention to moments when you find yourse=
lf saying things you didn't know you were thinking. Notice when the convers=
ation takes unexpected turns or when you circle back to ideas with new pers=
pective. These are signs that the exploratory process is working.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;"><strong>Map the Terrain</strong><span> Take the transcript to o3 (or=
 the most advanced reasoning model available to you) and ask it to map the =
cognitive terrain you've explored. Don't ask for summaries or action items=
=E2=80=94ask for patterns, connections, tensions, and the underlying concep=
tual architecture.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Try prompts like: &quot;This is a=
 transcript of an exploratory conversation. Help me understand the cognitiv=
e territory I was exploring. What were the central tensions or questions I =
was working with? What connections was I making between different ideas? Wh=
at assumptions or frameworks were implicitly guiding my thinking? What patt=
erns emerged that I might not have consciously recognized?&quot;</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">The key is to approach this as reconnaissance rather than organizatio=
n. You're not trying to clean up your thinking=E2=80=94you're trying to und=
erstand its natural topology.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Read the Map</strong>=
<span> Spend time with the cognitive map the reasoning model creates. Learn=
 to recognize the topology of your own thinking. Identify areas that feel w=
ell-developed and areas that seem to call for further exploration. Notice p=
atterns in how you approach complex questions. Look for tensions that might=
 be productive to maintain rather than immediately resolve.</span></p><p st=
yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">This is often where the most surprising insights emerge. You might =
discover that your thinking has been operating with assumptions you weren't=
 aware of, or that you've been exploring connections that only become visib=
le when mapped by advanced reasoning capabilities.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>=
Develop the Territory</strong><span> Use the map as a guide for further exp=
loration. Return to voice mode to investigate specific areas that seem prom=
ising. Use reasoning models to analyze particular tensions or connections i=
n greater depth. Gradually build more sophisticated understanding of the te=
rritory you're exploring.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">This phase often involves =
cycling between different models and different types of cognitive work. You=
 might explore creatively with voice mode, analyze with O3, refine conceptu=
ally with Claude Opus, then return to voice mode for further creative devel=
opment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Apply the Architecture</strong><span> Once =
you've developed a richer understanding of your chosen territory, begin app=
lying the insights and frameworks you've discovered to concrete challenges =
or opportunities. But remember=E2=80=94you're not imposing external framewo=
rks; you're working with conceptual architecture that has emerged from your=
 own cognitive exploration.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color:=
 rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The application phase of=
ten feels surprisingly natural because you're working with ideas that have =
grown organically from your own thinking rather than being borrowed from ex=
ternal sources.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: rela=
