DAILY MEMO: RENEWED IRAN TALKS, WEAPONS FOR UKRAINE [3]
WASHINGTON APPEARS READY TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEHRAN, BUT ISRAEL IS WARY.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
MEETING IN NORWAY. The U.S. and Iran reportedly could hold their first round of nuclear negotiations since the Israel-Iran ceasefire next week [4] in Norway. U.S. special envoy Steve Whitkoff is
apparently in the process of discussing the resumption of talks with Iran’s foreign minister. Israel has reportedly already made clear to the White House its red lines for the renewed talks.
BACKDOOR NEGOTIATIONS. Meanwhile, Israel has reportedly held secret talks [5] with Russia on Iran and Syria. The dialogue, aimed at finding a diplomatic settlement with both countries, followed
Israeli airstrikes last month against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israel also wants to reach an agreement with the U.S. on how to handle Iran – which will be a key topic in talks between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump next week.
NUCLEAR OVERSIGHT. France, Germany and Britain are prepared to activate the “trigger mechanism” [6] if Iran does not comply with the 2015 nuclear agreement's inspections requirements, French
Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said in a new interview. The three countries would effectively reimpose an embargo on arms, nuclear equipment, banking, and insurance for Iran, which on Wednesday
suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency following Israel’s attack on its nuclear facilities last month.
WEAPONS FOR UKRAINE. The United States has halted the delivery of weapons [7] already allocated to Ukraine over concerns that stockpiles could be running low. The move affects more than 20 Patriot air
defense missiles, over 20 Stinger man-portable air defense systems, an unspecified number of Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and more than 90 AIM air-to-air missiles. According to the Pentagon, the
U.S. is not completely halting aid to Ukraine but will consider options for continued military support that could help end the war. Kyiv, meanwhile, is reportedly considering asking European
governments to purchase U.S. weapons on its behalf [8]. Washington would have to approve the transfer of these arms to Kyiv.
RUSSIAN HARVEST. Russia’s harvested grain and leguminous crops totaled 3.8 million tons as of July 2 [9], less than a quarter of the total from the same time a year ago. The drop in production was a
result of a smaller harvest area and lower yield. Last month, Russia also exported just a quarter of the wheat it sold abroad in the same period last year [10] due to decreased demand. Only 16
countries purchased Russian wheat in June, down from 49 a year earlier.
MUTUAL DEFENSE. Britain and Germany reportedly plan to sign a mutual defense agreement [11]later this month. In addition to a clause on mutual assistance in case of an attack on either country, the
wide-ranging deal will also include measures on addressing illegal migration, transportation, and research and innovation. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer began talks on the agreement, which is
expected to be signed on July 17, with former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
RUSSIAN ENERGY. Russia’s oil and gas revenues fell to 494.8 billion rubles ($6.3 billion) in June [12], nearly the lowest level since Western sanctions on the sector began in January 2023. The
strong ruble and low global oil prices contributed to the decline. Consequently, oil and gas revenues are expected to contribute 26 billion rubles less than initially projected [13] to the federal
budget in July.
MILITARY COOPERATION. The U.S. and India agreed to a 10-year defense cooperation framework [14] following a call earlier this week between U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Indian Defense
Minister Rajnath Singh. The countries will officially sign the agreement during a meeting between their top defense officials later this year. Hegseth and Singh also discussed major upcoming U.S. arms
sales to India and the need for closer defense industrial cooperation.
CHINA AND EUROPE. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with European Union officials [15] in Brussels, ahead of an EU-China summit expected later this month. The talks covered a range of issues,
including the Russia-Ukraine war, the situation in the Middle East and Iran’s nuclear program. In her meeting with Wang, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized the EU’s
commitment to maintaining stable and constructive relations with Beijing, particularly on trade.
SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN POLICY. South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said in his first major press conference [16] that his government would pursue a pragmatic foreign policy, including improved
relations with Russia and China. Lee, who assumed office last month, said he would also prioritize South Korea’s national interests, a strong alliance with the United States and close cooperation
with Japan, which he plans to visit soon.
TALIBAN TALKS. Germany's interior minister has called for direct talks with the Taliban on the return of Afghan migrants to Afghanistan [17], despite the fact that Germany has no official diplomatic
relations with the Taliban government. The German government began last year deporting Afghans convicted of crimes to Afghanistan, a policy that had been suspended after the Taliban took power in
2021.
