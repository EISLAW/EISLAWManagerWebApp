When I got to dig into Claude=E2=80=99s latest release I had to check three=
 times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating.
Yesterday, I watched Claude build an eight-tab Excel spreadsheet with worki=
ng VLOOKUP formulas, conditional formatting, and a documentation tab explai=
ning its methodology=E2=80=94in under three minutes. Not a CSV file I had t=
o reformat. Not broken formulas I had to fix. An actual, professional sprea=
dsheet I could send to a colleague without touching a single cell.
Powerpoint? Is that your thing? Claude has you covered there too. It can ta=
ke complex financial data and turn it into a professional, scannable, prope=
rly formatted deck with good narrative flow and interesting business insigh=
ts your Director would actually want to see. My jaw was on the floor, and y=
ou=E2=80=99ll see it in the video.
I went live on video for 40 minutes with my buddy Rod (an AI consultant) to=
 stress-test it. We threw increasingly complex challenges at Claude, and yo=
u=E2=80=99ll see how shocked we were live as Claude handled everything we t=
hrew at it.
Curious? I packed this with what you need to get started with Claude Code I=
nterpreter (terrible name I agree, but what is new?!):
The complete 40-minute video where Rod and I discover capabilities we didn'=
t know existed=E2=80=94watch us build pivot tables with heat maps and spark=
lines Claude adds without being asked
Master prompt templates you can copy-paste right now to generate profession=
al Excel models and PowerPoint decks (tested on financial models, data anal=
ysis, and business presentations)
The exact Perplexity =E2=86=92 Claude workflow that gets superior results=
=E2=80=94how to use Perplexity to package data, then Claude to build files,=
 with specific examples
Side-by-side breakdowns of Claude vs Agent Mode showing precisely why one p=
roduces usable work and the other produces garbage
What Claude does automatically so you know what to expect=E2=80=94VLOOKUPs,=
 conditional formatting, documentation tabs, centered text, proper spacing
Real prompts from real tests including the Oracle valuation model and movie=
 night pivot table, so you can see exactly how to structure requests
Time savings data=E2=80=94Claude delivered minutes faster than Agent Mode w=
hile producing work you won't need to fix
Claude positioned this as a feature announcement and they=E2=80=99re wrong.
This isn't just another feature announcement. If you touch Excel or PowerPo=
int in your work, you now have templates and techniques to compress days of=
 work into minutes. Actually usable work, not drafts you'll rebuild. It=E2=
=80=99s a MASSIVE step forward.
Alfred North Whitehead said civilization advances by extending the number o=
f operations we can perform without thinking about them. (The idea being th=
at you can save your thinking for what matters more.)
I feel like it=E2=80=99s a bit cheesy to apply that to AI, but on the other=
 hand that is literally what I witnessed today, and this is going to be a l=
iteral 10x game-changer for anyone who works in Excel or PowerPoint for a l=
iving. I=E2=80=99m not exaggerating=E2=80=94I used to have to maintain mark=
eting spreadsheets for a living and what I saw out of Claude in 3 minutes w=
ould have taken me at least a half day.
So let=E2=80=99s dive in and start figuring out how to use AI for spreadshe=
ets and presentations!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
We=E2=80=99re going to do this one a little bit differently: the goal is fo=
r you to use this piece as a companion you can look through as you watch th=
e video, complete with prompts and thinking on how to make the most of Clau=
de=E2=80=99s new capabilities. You=E2=80=99ve got everything you need here =
to take advantage of the first AI to really do Excel and PowerPoint properl=
y. Enjoy!
First, what launched?
Claude's code interpreter launched with support for creating and editing Ex=
cel spreadsheets, PowerPoint slide decks, Word documents, and PDF files dir=
ectly in the Claude.ai web interface and desktop app.
Supported File Creation and Editing
Excel (.xlsx): Users can both create and modify spreadsheets, perform data =
analysis, and generate charts.
PowerPoint (.pptx): Claude can build and edit presentation decks, including=
 transforming reports or summaries into slides.
Word documents (.doc/.docx): Creation and editing of formatted text documen=
ts is fully supported.
PDF files: Claude can output finished reports, summaries, and other content=
 as PDFs or edit existing ones.
Additional Capabilities
Python and Node.js code execution: Claude can run custom Python (and Node.j=
s) code in a secure server-side sandbox to process, analyze, and generate f=
iles.
CSV/TSV and Advanced Data Analysis: Users can upload and analyze CSV/TSV da=
tasets, perform data science, visualize results, and output files according=
ly.
Other file types: Support extends to creating and analyzing files for data =
workflows, including generating images (like charts) in PNG format and hand=
ling various code and config filetypes in the code interpreter environment.
Usage and Rollout
Available now for Claude Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, with Pro users re=
ceiving access "in the coming weeks" and no announced date for free users.
Yes, we don=E2=80=99t really know when Pro plans get this, and I know that=
=E2=80=99s painful!
What are the takeaways from my deep dive?
Technical=20
Claude vs. OpenAI
OpenAI's Agent Mode leans too far in and attempts sophisticated analysis bu=
t fails in file execution. Claude takes a conservative approach but is actu=
ally able to create complete quality files.
Claude's architecture is optimized for production-ready outputs rather than=
 demos. The spreadsheets it generates have working formulas, proper formatt=
ing, and professional standards. This seems like a low bar but it=E2=80=99s=
 a BIG deal.
Speed and Reliability Performance
The delay is real: Claude consistently delivered results minutes faster tha=
n ChatGPT Agent Mode while producing higher quality outputs. Claude's infer=
ence architecture seems to handle planning and tool calling with the file o=
utput in mind all the way through. Agent Mode seems to create the file as a=
n output AFTER the analysis.
Professional Standards (aka Does it look good?)
TLDR Claude cooks: It adding correct heat maps, proper text centering, docu=
mentation tabs, and README files without explicit instructions. It even kne=
w how to handle spark lines in cells and could construct 8 tabs of proper f=
ormulas in one shot!
Claude volunteers features like VLOOKUP formulas, IF statements, and condit=
ional formatting automatically, but it can also follow prompts when you wan=
t advanced features like pivot tables and ask for them. The team at Anthrop=
ic has clearly figured out something special around tool calling + Opus 4.1=
 here.
Prompting Approach
Multi-LLM Workflow Optimization
Why work hard? I used Perplexity for comprehensive data gathering and promp=
t construction, Claude for document creation and formatting, and played wit=
h optional Agent Mode for initial analysis with Claude for final execution =
(Agent was good at analysis).
I would NOT ask Claude to do research and build the file in one shot. The m=
ost effective approach uses Perplexity to create self-contained data packag=
es rather than asking Claude to research and create simultaneously.
Prompt Construction Principles
My most successful prompts were data-first, instruction-last structured wit=
h complete financial/business data followed by specific formatting and outp=
ut requirements.
This implies that if you use internal data you=E2=80=99re going to need to =
take some effort to package up the data with the prompt. I do think it=E2=
=80=99s fine to pull a prompt in and attach csv files (I played with that s=
uccessfully and used multi-thousand row files).
Asking matters! When I didn't explicitly tell Claude to create Excel files,=
 it defaulted to text analysis.=20
Practical Implementation=20
Quality=20
The PowerPoint is good enough for everyday use across businesses, although =
I=E2=80=99d look at it twice before putting it in front of enterprise C-Sui=
te (I=E2=80=99ve also seen worse PowerPoints in boardrooms, though so YMMV)=
=2E
The Excel work compresses days of work into minutes and I=E2=80=99m not kid=
ding. If you value your time anywhere over $10 an hour and if you do Excel =
regularly, I think Max pays for itself really fast.
I have not tried Excel edits, and I suspect it will be better creating new =
files.
Cut Prep Time
Part of the time savings is iterativeness: rehearsing presentations within =
the AI interface before meetings. Having the conversation with Perplexity a=
nd Claude gets you in the mindset for a presentation and cuts prep time.
Documentation=20
Claude is better than me at formula documentation. Claude automatically cre=
ates methodology documentation, explaining formulas, assumptions, and data =
sources without being asked. I was really blown away here. Takes the black =
box away and builds trust.
Technical Architecture=20
Tool Use vs Raw Intelligence Trade-off
Claude appears to have made an architectural choice: prioritize reliable to=
ol execution over sophisticated analysis (remember Opus is technically not =
an inference model, it=E2=80=99s just a really big LLM). The payoff works: =
Claude produces usable, professional deliverables and Agent Mode=E2=80=A6do=
esn=E2=80=99t.
Cognitive Load=20
Claude's stepwise approach (analyze =E2=86=92 code in Python =E2=86=92 crea=
te spreadsheet =E2=86=92 document) suggests a smarter underlying agentic fr=
amework. Claude Opus 4.1 clearly plans well and knows when how to invoke to=
ols from natural language in a reliable manner.
Professional Standards as Training Data
The automatic addition of heat maps, proper formatting, and documentation s=
uggests Claude was trained extensively on professional document examples ra=
ther than just instructional data.
Strategy Implications
Wrapper Businesses Beware
Excel and PowerPoint were considered big barriers, and they fell today. If =
you=E2=80=99re betting on =E2=80=9CAI can=E2=80=99t do this yet=E2=80=9D ma=
ke sure you check your assumptions.
Just Claude Code and OpenAI Codex are eating Cursor, I=E2=80=99m thinking C=
laude=E2=80=99s skills here (which will only get better) will push hard on =
specialized tools like Gamma.
Delegate More
We can delegate a substantial new chunk of work to AI as of today. It=E2=80=
=99s the biggest single jump in half a year, and it=E2=80=99s going to make=
 AI-powered professionals even more powerful. Team implications are (as usu=
al) much more complex and will depend on team workflows.
Give me some prompts to get me started here=E2=80=A6
Yes, with the insights gathered there is enough to construct master-level p=
rompts for Claude to generate high-quality PowerPoint and Excel deliverable=
s. These prompts harness best practices for clarity, structural specificity=
, and maximizing Claude's automated capabilities while reflecting the most =
recent successful usage patterns.
Claude Master Prompt: Excel=20
You are a senior business analyst and expert Excel user. Create an Excel sp=
readsheet based on the following requirements:=20

1. Structure: - Include [describe tabs needed, e.g., "Input Data", "Analysi=
s", "Summary Dashboard with charts"]. - Use proper table formatting, cell a=
lignment, and color coding for readability. - Formulas: Use appropriate [ba=
sic (SUM, AVERAGE), or advanced (INDEX/MATCH, XLOOKUP)] formulas; explain u=
nique formulas in a "README" or "Documentation" tab.=20

2. Data: - [Describe if sample data is required, e.g., "Populate with reali=
stic sample data for a mid-sized tech company, 12 months, 6 expense categor=
ies"].=20

3. Automation: - Include automatic calculations, total summaries, or heat m=
aps where helpful. - If relevant, add validation to prevent common input er=
rors.=20

4. Documentation: - Add a "README" tab explaining data sources, calculation=
s, and instructions for updating the file.=20

5. Constraints: - Ensure the file is usable by intermediate-level Excel use=
rs. - No macros unless explicitly requested; keep all features within nativ=
e Excel capabilities. Requirements: [Insert project-specific, domain-specif=
ic requirements or upload relevant data if needed] Wait for my review of th=
e structure before proceeding to populate data and complete the analysis.
Key points:
Define structure, tabs, and formulas up front for clarity and best results.
Explicitly request documentation and intermediate-level formulas for mainta=
inability.
Ask for iterative or staged delivery for large projects (structure first, t=
hen formulas/data).
Claude Master Prompt: PowerPoint=20
You are a management consultant and expert presentation designer. Create a =
PowerPoint presentation for the following scenario:=20

1. Structure & Story: - Organize content into [number] sections: [list sect=
ions, e.g., "Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Key Recommendations, Finan=
cial Projections"]. - For each section, create slides with clear headlines =
and concise bullet points. - Include one data visualization (chart or graph=
) per major section [specify sources or require sample data as needed].=20

2. Visual & Formatting Guidelines: - Use a clean, professional theme with c=
onsistent fonts, color palette, aligned titles, and properly spaced content=
=2E - Add icons, callouts, or summary b=
oxes to highlight key insights where a=
ppropriate. - Ensure slides are visually uncluttered=E2=80=94no more than 6=
 bullet points per slide.=20

3. Requirements: - Add a "Backup" section for any supporting detail slides =
or appendices. - Include slide notes summarizing the presenter=E2=80=99s me=
ssage for each slide, where interpretation is critical. - For any tables or=
 charts, ensure underlying data is included in an accessible format or work=
sheet.=20

4. Constraints: - Deck should be usable as a stand-alone readout (i.e., sel=
f-explanatory if shared without presenter). - Output as a PowerPoint file, =
ready for download. Input/Scenario: [describe business case, meeting object=
ive, or presentation target] [Review and iterate on structure before finali=
zing full content if it's a large or high-stakes deck.]
Key points:
Be explicit about structure, sectioning, data visualization, and formatting=
 needs.
Require slide notes/presenter guide for full context.
Ask for a review checkpoint on structure for strategic decks.anthropic+3 [ =

Best Practices for Claude Prompting
Upload all relevant files and describe desired end state up front for maxim=
al context.
Explicitly state documentation, skill, and review/iteration preferences.
For highly specialized decks or models, provide sample data and context, an=
d incrementally build with Claude=E2=80=99s assistance.
A few extra prompts
Want to go farther? I put together some additional prompts specific to usin=
g Claude=E2=80=99s interpreter for Excel and PowerPoint workflows. These pu=
ll in prompt best practices and give you options to tackle a variety of tas=
ks with Claude Code Interpeter.
Start with Data, End with Instructions
Principle: Place your data, scenario, or requirements upfront, then provide=
 clear, specific instructions at the end. This structure dramatically impro=
ves Claude=E2=80=99s file generation quality.
Prompt Template for Excel:
<data> Financial results for FY25: - Revenue: 10M, Expenses: 6M, ... [paste=
 data or describe] </data> <instructions> You are a corporate finance analy=
st. Build an Excel workbook with: =E2=80=A2 Tabs: Input Data, Calculations,=
 Summary Dashboard. =E2=80=A2 Use formulas for all calculations, including =
year-over-year growth. =E2=80=A2 Add conditional formatting (heatmaps) to h=
ighlight top and bottom performers. =E2=80=A2 Include a 'README' sheet expl=
aining each tab and assumptions. =E2=80=A2 Make it usable for a non-expert =
to update monthly going forward. Wait for my review of the structure before=
 populating all data. </instructions>
Set the stage
Principle: Set the context for what you=E2=80=99re looking for and explain =
your constraints, goals, and immediate ask.
Prompt Template for PowerPoint:
<scenario> You are a McKinsey-level management consultant. Task: Create a P=
owerPoint presentation for a board meeting on [topic]. </scenario> <instruc=
tions> =E2=80=A2 Sections: Executive Summary, Market Overview, Key Recommen=
dations, Risks. =E2=80=A2 For each section, draft 1-2 slides with concise, =
insight-rich headlines. =E2=80=A2 Add a summary chart or visual per section=
 using sample data. =E2=80=A2 Use a clean, professional layout, logical sli=
de order, and speaker notes for key slides. =E2=80=A2 Include a backup/appe=
ndix section for data details. Present only the outline before drafting ful=
l slides. </instructions>
Explicit Output Formatting and Modularization
Principle: Specify exact file structure, formatting (e.g., tables, visual h=
ighlights), and modular task breakdown in the prompt. For complex workbooks=
 or decks, assign tasks stepwise and reference completed outputs as context=
=2Eiweaver+1 [ https://substack.com/red=
irect/5d0c34aa-2e37-4909-863d-514ec555=
bc4c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Excel Prompt Example:
Create an Excel file with three clearly separated tabs: 1. Raw monthly sale=
s data, formatted as a table. 2. Calculated KPIs (gross margin, growth %, e=
tc.), using cell formulas. 3. Dashboard with charts summarizing trends and =
highlighting outliers. Explain any advanced formulas in a dedicated 'Formul=
a Notes' tab.
PowerPoint Prompt Example:
For each section, create a slide with: =E2=80=A2 Headline summarizing the m=
ain point. =E2=80=A2 3-5 bullet points, each supported by data or visual (c=
hart/graph). =E2=80=A2 Apply consistent color palette; ensure slides are ea=
sy to read. After all sections, generate an executive summary as the first =
slide.
Chain-of-Thought and Quality Control
Principle: Ask Claude to walk through reasoning and perform a self-check on=
 output validity, especially for formulas and visual elements.anthropic+2 [=
 https://substack.com/redirect/348b47f1-cd64-4985-a5bb-374162e879bf?j=3DeyJ=
1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Prompt Addition:
Before finalizing, list any formulas, charts, or formatting details you're =
unsure about, and justify why you chose specific methods. Revise based on y=
our self-assessment before outputting the final file.
Iterative Prompts
Principle: For substantial, high-stakes artifacts (multi-tab Excel, board-l=
evel decks), require Claude to deliver structure/outlines first, then popul=
ate each with content in rounds.walturn+2 [ https://substack.com/redirect/9=
c22352e-7315-464e-8a03-2b37bf6c644d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf=
9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
Prompt Addition:
Deliver only the file structure (tab names/slides, layout, summary of formu=
las) for my review first. Once approved, proceed to fill in details, data, =
and visuals step-by-step.
These practices=E2=80=94structuring with XML tags or labeled sections, assi=
gning expert roles, breaking complex output into steps, and explicitly requ=
iring explainability and review checkpoints=E2=80=94yield the most robust, =
production-ready Excel and PowerPoint files using the newest Claude interpr=
eter abilities.
The TLDR
=E2=80=9CCivilization advances by extending the number of important operati=
ons which we can perform without thinking of them.=E2=80=9D - Alfred North =
Whitehead
This is a big moment. A substantial part of the workday got easier today, a=
nd it=E2=80=99s relatively easy for anyone to go and use.=20
We=E2=80=99re going to have more consistent and useful spreadsheets (the on=
es I show on the video are above average as far as fit and finish), and we=
=E2=80=99ll see the end of PowerPoint hell. Businesses that make their livi=
ng making these manual tasks slightly easier are in trouble.=20
Longterm, even Microsoft should be worried about the value moving out of th=
eir tool into the AI. Chatbots continue to be a tremendously sticky interfa=
ce!=20
One more note: Claude=E2=80=99s choice to release this for Pro plans first =
is reinforcing a pay-to-play format that=E2=80=99s starting to become a rea=
l pattern across model makers. You can literally pay to get twice or three =
times the work done now. People who can, will, and they=E2=80=99ll have a m=
assive advantage.=20
