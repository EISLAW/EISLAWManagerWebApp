GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: POLITICAL LANGUAGE AND TURKEY'S OPTIONS [3]
BY: GEORGE FRIEDMAN
THE 2020S AND ITS HISTORIC SHIFT: POLAND’S EVOLUTION [4]
Sept. 8, 2025
_Question: Can you explain the policies and philosophical underpinnings defined by the terms “far-right” and “far-left” that the media uses? There are other common pejorative terms used to
demonize various movements such as “fascism.” In today’s context it’s hard to see fascism the way it was formulated in Europe in the 1930s and 40s. Another example is “communism” versus
“socialism.” In the U.S. we make a rather stark distinction between the two terms, but it seems some people use the two terms interchangeably._
Response: There are always terms used in political discourse that are not really comprehensible but meant as an insult. During the Cold War, calling someone a communist was commonplace, meaning he was
an evil and ruthless person, like Stalin. The term fascist serves the same purpose, in that calling someone a fascist means they are like Hitler. During the Cold War the right used the term communist
to insult the left, and now the left insults the right by linking them with Hitler. Those terms are used to insult the other, and also to link them, in the eyes of others, with a tyrant. The terms
“right” and “left” emerged in the French Revolution, with the right (conservatives) wanting to preserve the monarchy and the left (liberals) wanting to create a liberal democracy. Using those
terms today, particularly with the prefix “far-” or “extreme,” is intended to insult and marginalize the other. In point of fact there are very few around who actually know what these words
mean, but most know it’s an insult. Best I can do on this one.
-------------------------
_Question: __Is it possible the Putin government is weak enough to want a war with NATO to solidify his position as leader? Is there a downside to this tactic?_
Response: To begin with, I have to point out that NATO is incapable of attacking Russia because NATO, including the United States, does not have the ability to defeat the Russian military and occupy
Russia, so nothing Vladimir Putin does would, I hope, trigger that insanity. I think Putin is refusing to end the war now because his utter failure to defeat and occupy Ukraine completely, at the cost
of many lives and a weakened economy, would make him look like a chump and a loser, and that might cost him a great deal. Therefore, his best political move is to keep fighting and pray that the
Ukrainians collapse. But Napoleon and Hitler both invaded Russia and failed. Hitler blew his brains out when the Russians took Berlin, Napoleon went into exile and then died. Invading Russia has not
had a good history, and the Europeans and Americans know that.
-------------------------
GEORGE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS: LEADERS AND POLAND'S DEMOGRAPHICS [5]
Sept. 13, 2025
_Question: With reference to your sentence: “I rarely talk about leaders because I regard them not as the makers of history but as its prisoner.” But unfortunately, isn’t it the leaders who make
the decisions to start a war, to invade a country, to apply commercial tariffs on a large number of products, to create hate versus other populations or immigrants (see the U.K. in recent days)?
Isn’t it leaders who plan some actions to distract the public opinion of Europe (e.g., sending a bunch of drones into Poland) while they are planning more disruptive covert actions progressively
modifying the political orientation of Europe by supporting and pushing all political parties and groups that are against financially supporting Ukraine?_
Response: The decision to continue the war by the Russians, as I said, is something reality has imposed on Putin. I would think he regrets invading in the first place, but had to in order to extend
Russia’s buffer zone for security. The power of leaders is based on their ability to face reality and engineer solutions. The nature of outstanding politicians is that they grasp reality and what
the moment demands, and submit to it, while crafting a response. So in that sense I do not see excellent leaders as choosing what they want to do but rather responding to necessity. We know that they
are great politicians when they succeed, and bad politicians when they fail, but when you take a look at the details you find that both the decision and outcome was the product of the circumstances
they were in. So in predicting what will happen I am far more interested in the conditions than in the leader. Politicians who do not submit to reality have a preface before their titles – either
“former” or “the late.”
-------------------------
THE 2020S AND ITS HISTORIC SHIFT: TURKEY’S EVOLUTION [6]
Sept. 15, 2025
_Question: __Can a state realistically project power regionally without first stabilizing its economic foundations?_
Response: Sometimes the only way you can stabilize your economy is to go to war. The German economy was devastated by World War I, and the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war left Germany in a
catastrophic state. Hitler came to power because of the economic catastrophe brought about by losing the war. The economy improved somewhat after Hitler became a dictator in 1934, but it was not
robust. One of his goals in spending on the military was to use the war to gain territory and improve the economy. Sometimes you wage wars to increase the nation’s wealth through conquest, and
sometimes nations go to war because they are so poor they have nothing to lose. A ruthless military can possibly defeat a wealthy, fat and lazy enemy.
-------------------------
_Question: How might Turkey’s NATO membership constrain or empower its freedom of action?_
Response: That is a very interesting question and an important one. Turkey was admitted to NATO because at the time it was threatened by the Soviet Union, and it was so strategically located that the
U.S. would want to defend Turkey and so included it in NATO. They get to go to NATO meetings and cocktail parties, but I don’t think they would attack Russia if Russia invaded Poland and Article 5
(an attack on one is an attack on all) was invoked, so while they are full members of NATO, the Northern Europeans’ security issues are not Turkey’s and vice versa. But I really don’t know, and
can’t imagine the role they would play if NATO went to war. Nor can I imagine that NATO members, save the United States, would have much influence over Turkey if it felt the need to go to war.
-------------------------
_Question: Given the historical mistrust between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia's emerging relationship with Pakistan, whose military power could be an alternative to Turkey for Saudi
Arabia? Why do you think the Saudis would be willing to collaborate with Turkey?_
Response: Let's begin with the Saudis and Pakistan. It is certain that Saudi wealth would increase the security of Pakistan. But I do not think Pakistan is capable of providing the security that the
Saudis need, and Pakistan has a hostile relationship with India, which is emerging as a significant power. Pakistan's military must be focused on India. Pakistan has emerged as an ally of China, which
provides the weapons and technologies that Pakistan requires. A relationship between the Saudis and Pakistan makes the Saudis potentially hostile to India, which has recently clashed with China along
its border. In spite of the recent show of solidarity with China against the United States, India is still a competitor and potential military threat to China. Pakistan's military power is based on
its relationship with China, and all this makes it more important for continued good relations between China and Pakistan.
Saudi dependence on Pakistan creates massive uncertainty and complexity for the Saudis. It is true that the Saudis and Turks have a dislike of each other, but dislike in business and in geopolitics
can be soothed by reality. Saudi Arabia needs to be militarily secure, and Turkey needs Saudi money. Deep hostility in geopolitics can be managed. The relationship between the U.S. and Japan, for
example, overcame deep mutual distrust and even hatred. Turkey is far more secure than Pakistan, and far less hostile toward India, another power that the Saudis have no quarrel with. Pakistan is far
more dependent on a third party, China, for its military power. Nations can overcome all sorts of hostility if reality demands it. So in my view Turkey is not only more powerful than Pakistan, but has
fewer dependencies on other nations. Turkey may be less likable to the Saudis but much more reliable.

Sept. 8, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Can =
you explain the policies and philosophical underpinnings defined by the ter=
ms =E2=80=9Cfar-right=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfar-left=E2=80=9D that the medi=
a uses? There are other common pejorative terms used to demonize various mo=
vements such as =E2=80=9Cfascism.=E2=80=9D In today=E2=80=99s context it=E2=
=80=99s hard to see fascism the way it was formulated in Europe in the 1930=
s and 40s. Another example is =E2=80=9Ccommunism=E2=80=9D versus =E2=80=9Cs=
ocialism.=E2=80=9D In the U.S. we make a rather stark distinction between t=
he two terms, but it seems some people use the two terms interchangeably.</=
em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: There ar=
e always terms used in political discourse that are not really comprehensib=
le but meant as an insult. During the Cold War, calling someone a communist=
 was commonplace, meaning he was an evil and ruthless person, like Stalin. =
The term fascist serves the same purpose, in that calling someone a fascist=
 means they are like Hitler. During the Cold War the right used the term co=
mmunist to insult the left, and now the left insults the right by linking t=
hem with Hitler. Those terms are used to insult the other, and also to link=
 them, in the eyes of others, with a tyrant. The terms =E2=80=9Cright=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Cleft=E2=80=9D emerged in the French Revolution, with the r=
ight (conservatives) wanting to preserve the monarchy and the left (liberal=
s) wanting to create a liberal democracy. Using those terms today, particul=
arly with the prefix =E2=80=9Cfar-=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cextreme,=E2=80=9D i=
s intended to insult and marginalize the other. In point of fact there are =
very few around who actually know what these words mean, but most know it=
=E2=80=99s an insult. Best I can do on this one.</p>

><em>Is it possible the Putin government is weak enough to want a war with =
NATO to solidify his position as leader? Is there a downside to this tactic=
?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: To begin=
 with, I have to point out that NATO is incapable of attacking Russia becau=
se NATO, including the United States, does not have the ability to defeat t=
he Russian military and occupy Russia, so nothing Vladimir Putin does would=
, I hope, trigger that insanity. I think Putin is refusing to end the war n=
ow because his utter failure to defeat and occupy Ukraine completely, at th=
e cost of many lives and a weakened economy, would make him look like a chu=
mp and a loser, and that might cost him a great deal. Therefore, his best p=
olitical move is to keep fighting and pray that the Ukrainians collapse. Bu=
t Napoleon and Hitler both invaded Russia and failed. Hitler blew his brain=
s out when the Russians took Berlin, Napoleon went into exile and then died=
. Invading Russia has not had a good history, and the Europeans and America=
ns know that.</p>

s: Leaders and Poland's Demographics</a></strong><br>
Sept. 13, 2025</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: With=
 reference to your sentence: =E2=80=9CI rarely talk about leaders because I=
 regard them not as the makers of history but as its prisoner.=E2=80=9D But=
 unfortunately, isn=E2=80=99t it the leaders who make the decisions to star=
t a war, to invade a country, to apply commercial tariffs on a large number=
 of products, to create hate versus other populations or immigrants (see th=
e U.K. in recent days)? Isn=E2=80=99t it leaders who plan some actions to d=
istract the public opinion of Europe (e.g., sending a bunch of drones into =
Poland) while they are planning more disruptive covert actions progressivel=
y modifying the political orientation of Europe by supporting and pushing a=
ll political parties and groups that are against financially supporting Ukr=
aine?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: The deci=
sion to continue the war by the Russians, as I said, is something reality h=
as imposed on Putin. I would think he regrets invading in the first place, =
but had to in order to extend Russia=E2=80=99s buffer zone for security. Th=
e power of leaders is based on their ability to face reality and engineer s=
olutions. The nature of outstanding politicians is that they grasp reality =
and what the moment demands, and submit to it, while crafting a response. S=
o in that sense I do not see excellent leaders as choosing what they want t=
o do but rather responding to necessity. We know that they are great politi=
cians when they succeed, and bad politicians when they fail, but when you t=
ake a look at the details you find that both the decision and outcome was t=
he product of the circumstances they were in. So in predicting what will ha=
ppen I am far more interested in the conditions than in the leader. Politic=
ians who do not submit to reality have a preface before their titles =E2=80=
=93 either =E2=80=9Cformer=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cthe late.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: </em=
><em>Can a state realistically project power regionally without first stabi=
lizing its economic foundations?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Sometime=
s the only way you can stabilize your economy is to go to war. The German e=
conomy was devastated by World War I, and the Treaty of Versailles that end=
ed the war left Germany in a catastrophic state. Hitler came to power becau=
se of the economic catastrophe brought about by losing the war. The economy=
 improved somewhat after Hitler became a dictator in 1934, but it was not r=
obust. One of his goals in spending on the military was to use the war to g=
ain territory and improve the economy. Sometimes you wage wars to increase =
the nation=E2=80=99s wealth through conquest, and sometimes nations go to w=
ar because they are so poor they have nothing to lose. A ruthless military =
can possibly defeat a wealthy, fat and lazy enemy.</p>

might Turkey=E2=80=99s NATO membership constrain or empower its freedom of =
action?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: That is =
a very interesting question and an important one. Turkey was admitted to NA=
TO because at the time it was threatened by the Soviet Union, and it was so=
 strategically located that the U.S. would want to defend Turkey and so inc=
luded it in NATO. They get to go to NATO meetings and cocktail parties, but=
 I don=E2=80=99t think they would attack Russia if Russia invaded Poland an=
d Article 5 (an attack on one is an attack on all) was invoked, so while th=
ey are full members of NATO, the Northern Europeans=E2=80=99 security issue=
s are not Turkey=E2=80=99s and vice versa. But I really don=E2=80=99t know,=
 and can=E2=80=99t imagine the role they would play if NATO went to war. No=
r can I imagine that NATO members, save the United States, would have much =
influence over Turkey if it felt the need to go to war.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><em>Question: Give=
n the historical mistrust between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia=
's emerging relationship with Pakistan, whose military power could be an al=
ternative to Turkey for Saudi Arabia? Why do you think the Saudis would be =
willing to collaborate with Turkey?</em></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Response: Let's be=
gin with the Saudis and Pakistan. It is certain that Saudi wealth would inc=
rease the security of Pakistan. But I do not think Pakistan is capable of p=
roviding the security that the Saudis need, and Pakistan has a hostile rela=
tionship with India, which is emerging as a significant power. Pakistan's m=
ilitary must be focused on India. Pakistan has emerged as an ally of China,=
 which provides the weapons and technologies that Pakistan requires. A rela=
tionship between the Saudis and Pakistan makes the Saudis potentially hosti=
le to India, which has recently clashed with China along its border. In spi=
te of the recent show of solidarity with China against the United States, I=
ndia is still a competitor and potential military threat to China. Pakistan=
's military power is based on its relationship with China, and all this mak=
es it more important for continued good relations between China and Pakista=
n.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Saudi dependence o=
n Pakistan creates massive uncertainty and complexity for the Saudis. It is=
 true that the Saudis and Turks have a dislike of each other, but dislike i=
n business and in geopolitics can be soothed by reality. Saudi Arabia needs=
 to be militarily secure, and Turkey needs Saudi money. Deep hostility in g=
eopolitics can be managed. The relationship between the U.S. and Japan, for=
 example, overcame deep mutual distrust and even hatred. Turkey is far more=
 secure than Pakistan, and far less hostile toward India, another power tha=
t the Saudis have no quarrel with. Pakistan is far more dependent on a thir=
d party, China, for its military power. Nations can overcome all sorts of h=
ostility if reality demands it. So in my view Turkey is not only more power=
ful than Pakistan, but has fewer dependencies on other nations. Turkey may =
be less likable to the Saudis but much more reliable.</p>
