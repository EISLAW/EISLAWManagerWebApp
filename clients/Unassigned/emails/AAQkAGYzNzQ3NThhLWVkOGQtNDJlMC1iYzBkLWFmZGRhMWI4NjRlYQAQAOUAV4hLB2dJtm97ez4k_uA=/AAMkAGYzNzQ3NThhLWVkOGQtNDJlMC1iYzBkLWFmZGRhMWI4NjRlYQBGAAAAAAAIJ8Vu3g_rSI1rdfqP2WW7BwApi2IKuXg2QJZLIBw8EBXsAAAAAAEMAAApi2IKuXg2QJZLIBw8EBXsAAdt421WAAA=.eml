DAILY MEMO: TURKEY-SYRIA DEAL, US-RUSSIA TRADE [3]
ANKARA IS OFFERING DEFENSE SUPPORT FOR THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN DAMASCUS.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
TURKISH ASSISTANCE. Turkey reportedly agreed [4] to facilitate the procurement of weapons and logistical material for Syria under a memorandum of understanding signed Wednesday. The deal, agreed to
during a visit of the Syrian foreign minister, defense minister and intelligence chief to Ankara, is part of Turkey’s continued support for the new Syrian administration. At a joint press
conference, the foreign ministers from both countries criticized [5] Israel’s attempts to “undermine” Syria’s security and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces for not following through
with an agreement to merge with the Syrian army.
SLOW REBOUND. Trade turnover between the United States and Russia increased 31.3 percent [6] in the first half of 2025 compared with last year. U.S. imports from Russia increased 32.7 percent, while
exports to Russia grew 20.7 percent. U.S. purchases of Russian goods (including fertilizers, enriched uranium, platinum, turbojet engines and turbines, and wood and wood products) accounted for $2.5
billion of their total $2.8 billion trade – which remains substantially lower than a decade ago.
RUSSIAN OPERATION. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said [7] it damaged Ukrainian facilities producing Sapsan ballistic missile systems in a joint operation with the Russian Defense Ministry.
The attacks, conducted throughout July, inflicted fire damage on the buildings located in the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions used to manufacture the systems, which the FSB said could be used to
strike deep into Russian territory and were developed with the support of “specialists from one of the Western European countries.” The agency also said [8] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
discussed the design details of the Sapsan with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin in May.
DEFENSE COOPERATION. Military officials from India and Kazakhstan held talks [9] in New Delhi aimed at expanding defense cooperation and developing joint projects. The Kazakh delegation was led by the
deputy defense minister and chief of the army general staff, who held separate meetings with India’s chief of defense staff and minister of state for defense. They discussed joint military training,
counterterrorism operations, military exercises and the defense industry.
RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA. A delegation of Russian lawmakers led by parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin arrived in North Korea [10] for an official visit. In a meeting with the chairman of the
North’s parliamentary standing committee, Volodin thanked Pyongyang [11] for its help in liberating the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces. Ahead of the trip, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un assured
Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call that Pyongyang would continue to support Moscow.
MORE TROOPS. Relatedly, North Korea plans to send 6,000 troops and military equipment to Russia, Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said [12]. The deployment is ostensibly meant to assist
in demining and reconstruction work in Russia’s Kursk region but will likely involve other matters as well, according to Budanov. The intel chief said North Korea also plans to bring 50 to 100 units
of equipment, including M2010 main battle tanks and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers, to Russia.
REASSURANCES. Armenia’s deputy foreign minister, Vahan Kostanyan, was in Iran [13] this week for meetings with top Iranian foreign affairs officials. On the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace agreement signed
last week in Washington, which includes provisions for a transit corridor along the Iranian border, Kostanyan reassured Tehran that Yerevan would take into account its interests and that the project
would respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to visit Armenia next week for a bilateral business forum.
MEETING IN TEHRAN. Iran’s foreign minister held talks [14] in Tehran with the Russian Foreign Ministry’s envoy for the Caucasus to discuss bilateral cooperation and developments in the region,
including the Armenia-Azerbaijan issue.
MILITARY TIES. The head of Azerbaijan’s army general staff, Karim Valiyev, met with Pakistan’s army chief in Islamabad [15]. They discussed prospects for cooperation between the countries. Veliyev
also took part in Pakistan’s first military parade to mark its Independence Day.
WARMING RELATIONS. China and India are reportedly discussing [16] the resumption of bilateral trade five years after it was suspended following border clashes. According to reports, the talks are
focused on reopening three corridors along the contested Himalayan frontier for trade of locally produced goods. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to visit India [17] on Monday for negotiations
on the border dispute.
U.S.-ISRAEL COOPERATION. Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, held talks [18] with the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the new chief of CENTCOM.
