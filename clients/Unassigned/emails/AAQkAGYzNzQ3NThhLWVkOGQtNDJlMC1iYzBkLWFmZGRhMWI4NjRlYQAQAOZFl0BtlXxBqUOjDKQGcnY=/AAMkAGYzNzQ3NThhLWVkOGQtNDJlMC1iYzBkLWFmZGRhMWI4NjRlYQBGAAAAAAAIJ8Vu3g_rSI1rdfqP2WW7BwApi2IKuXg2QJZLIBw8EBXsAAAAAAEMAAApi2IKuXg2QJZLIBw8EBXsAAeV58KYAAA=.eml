I keep getting asked to share how I get so much done.=20
I keep getting asked to share how I=E2=80=99ve 20x=E2=80=99d (or more) my a=
bility to generate quality work in 20 years.
But I thought I=E2=80=99d do one better than that: I want to explicitly lay=
 out an easy-to-use framework for scaling expertise using AI across more th=
an 20 different job roles.
I=E2=80=99m laying out for you my exact mental framework for leveraging AI =
to scale my own expertise, so you understand how Nate gets so much done.=20
But beyond that, I want you to be able to grab these prompts and use them t=
o start scaling your own expertise. Because that=E2=80=99s what this really=
 is: a universal framework for scaling expertise.=20
AI gives us tools to scale expertise that just weren=E2=80=99t possible eve=
n two years ago.=20
And the thing is, learning this framework now sets you up for the 50x+ scal=
ing multiple I expect in the next year. AI will keep getting better, and th=
at means free additional multiples on expertise next year for people who fi=
gure this out now.=20
We all have different kinds of expertise, so I=E2=80=99ve included a REALLY=
 wide range here.
Here are 27 prompts to get you going on scaling expertise in a way that wor=
ks for you.
Tech and product Prompts
Senior Software Engineer =E2=80=94 RFC Document
Vibe Coder =E2=80=94 Technical Spec
Product Manager =E2=80=94 PRD
Engineer =E2=80=94 Technical Design Doc
CTO =E2=80=94 Engineering Strategy Memo
Go-to-market and customer-facing prompts
Marketing Consultant =E2=80=94 Campaign Strategy
Head of Sales =E2=80=94 Sales Strategy Document
Entrepreneur =E2=80=94 Investor Update
Customer Success Manager =E2=80=94 Account Plan
Insurance Agent =E2=80=94 Policy Comparison
Amazon FBA Seller =E2=80=94 Product Description
Finance and legal prompts
CPA =E2=80=94 Tax Strategy Letter
Financial Advisor =E2=80=94 Quarterly Portfolio Report
Attorney =E2=80=94 Discovery Responses
Healthcare prompts
Family Physician =E2=80=94 SOAP Notes
Dentist =E2=80=94 Treatment Plan Letter
Veterinarian =E2=80=94 Surgery Recommendation
Built environment and home services prompts
Architect =E2=80=94 Project Proposal
General Contractor =E2=80=94 Remodel Estimate
HVAC Contractor =E2=80=94 Estimate
Plumber =E2=80=94 Repiping Estimate
Electrician =E2=80=94 Panel Upgrade Proposal
Landscaper =E2=80=94 Backyard Renovation Proposal
Real Estate Agent =E2=80=94 Property Listing
Personal services and events prompts
Wedding Planner =E2=80=94 Client Proposal
College Counselor =E2=80=94 Student Recommendation Letter
YES, you might notice the expertise doesn=E2=80=99t stop at tech roles! Exp=
ertise is a universal human skill, and AI can help you scale even if you do=
n=E2=80=99t work in tech. That=E2=80=99s part of why I spent time crafting =
so many prompts.=20
All this and we=E2=80=99re not done yet! On top of all 27 prompts, I=E2=80=
=99ve put together:
A 5 minute TLDR to explain how it all works
A complete how-to guide
Common pitfalls and what to watch for=20
A clear framework you can scale to other areas of expertise
Basically, I wrote the guide I would have wanted when I started to figure o=
ut how to scale with AI by trial-and-error a couple of years ago. I wrote t=
he guide to help you understand the keys to how I think, and how I construc=
t prompts to scale my own expertise.
By the end of this guide, you won=E2=80=99t just have 27 prompts=E2=80=94yo=
u=E2=80=99ll be able to use this framework to write any prompt you need to =
scale your own expertise. You=E2=80=99ll be ready to scale your expertise p=
ast 50x as AI gets better and better over the next year.

Here=E2=80=99s what you=E2=80=99re getting: 27 prompts across every domain =
where expertise hits a documentation bottleneck. These matter because seein=
g the pattern once isn=E2=80=99t enough=E2=80=94you need to see it applied =
across different fields to understand what stays the same and what changes.=
=20
The consistent structure across all 27 prompts is the teaching method: ever=
y single one follows the same four-part formula (your role, your audience, =
your goal, your constraints), then you add your raw expertise.=20
The structure never changes, only the domain-specific application changes. =
The goal here is to get you practicing in a very consistent way so you can =
see the specific spots you need to edit very quickly once the prompt result=
s come back.
Once you see this pattern repeat across legal work, medical documentation, =
trade estimates, and engineering specs, you understand how to build your ow=
n prompts for whatever you do. Don=E2=80=99t read all 27=E2=80=94search the=
 document for your field and start there, then look at a few others to see =
what transfers.
The TLDR=20
The constraint on expertise has never been your knowledge. It=E2=80=99s the=
 translation layer. You can diagnose a problem in minutes, but documenting =
that diagnosis takes hours. You know the strategy immediately, but writing =
the brief takes all day. Your brain works fast. Documentation works slow. T=
hat ratio is the bottleneck.
AI removes it=E2=80=94but not in the way most people think. Large language =
models are pattern-matching engines trained on billions of examples of prof=
essional documentation. They=E2=80=99ve seen thousands of legal briefs, med=
ical charts, project proposals, and estimates. They know the structure, the=
 format, the professional conventions. What they don=E2=80=99t have is your=
 specific expertise, your client context, your professional judgment. That=
=E2=80=99s the gap.
And that=E2=80=99s why bad prompting makes for bad expertise, and why peopl=
e give up.
The breakthrough is this: when you provide the expertise within a useful, p=
redictable prompt to the LLM, LLMs can leverage that expertise to build a p=
rofessional output in a fraction of the time.=20
You give it four things=E2=80=94your role, your audience, your goal, and yo=
ur constraints=E2=80=94plus your raw knowledge in whatever form is fastest =

e documentation bottleneck.=20
And I want to emphasize one thing here=E2=80=94there=E2=80=99s a scaling li=
mit on LLM ability to replace expertise. They just do not have your years o=
f experience or problem specific knowledge. So you need to work with them i=
n such a way that you can predictably touch the work and bring your experti=
se to bear=E2=80=94the thing that makes it great.
This article shows you exactly how it works with 20 domain-specific example=
s, walks through the four principles that make it work, and gives you the f=
ive-step process to implement it in your field. Whether you=E2=80=99re in l=
aw, medicine, trades, consulting, or engineering=E2=80=94if your expertise =
is the product, this is how you scale it.
How to Scale Your Expertise with AI
For thousands of years, there have been only three ways to scale your exper=
tise. All of them suck. AI just invented a fourth way, and most professiona=
ls still don=E2=80=99t know about it.
Here=E2=80=99s the problem that nobody talks about: expertise is the one th=
ing in business that doesn=E2=80=99t scale naturally. You can scale product=
s by manufacturing more. You can scale content by publishing more. You can =
scale distribution to reach more people. But expertise only lives in your b=
rain, and there have been exactly three ways to work around this constraint=
=2E
The Three Traditional Ways to Scale (And Why They Fail)
Option one: work more hours. You=E2=80=99re a lawyer, client demand goes up=
, so you work nights and weekends until you burn out. This doesn=E2=80=99t =
scale because there=E2=80=99s not infinite time in the day.
Option two: hire people. You bring on associates, junior lawyers, apprentic=
es=E2=80=94whoever. But they don=E2=80=99t scale expertise, they dilute it.=
 The junior person isn=E2=80=99t you. They don=E2=80=99t have the years of =
pattern recognition that come with real expertise. Every piece of work they=
 touch needs review by someone who actually knows what they=E2=80=99re doin=
g. You end up trading your actual work for management work, and you=E2=80=
=99re still the bottleneck.
Option three: raise your prices. You charge $600 an hour, then $1,000 an ho=
ur. But there=E2=80=99s a ceiling. Eventually you=E2=80=99re too expensive =
for most clients, and you=E2=80=99ve traded volume for rate while still bei=
ng limited by time.
These are your options. This is why every expertise-based business hits a w=
all. Whether you=E2=80=99re in legal, medicine, senior engineering, HVAC in=
stallation, plumbing, or any other field where knowledge is the product, yo=
ur expertise hits a scaling wall. Your knowledge is the asset, and there=E2=
=80=99s only one of you.
Enter AI and the fourth way. But the breakthrough isn=E2=80=99t what most p=
eople think it is.
The Real Constraint Wasn=E2=80=99t Your Expertise
The thing nobody says out loud: the constraint has never really been your e=
xpertise. It=E2=80=99s been the translation layer.
Look at an HVAC contractor diagnosing a failing system. That takes her 20 m=
inutes. She knows what=E2=80=99s wrong=E2=80=94undersized unit, leaking duc=
twork, whatever it is. She has 15 years of experience. The diagnosis is fas=
t.
Writing the estimate that explains this to a homeowner takes 2.5 hours. It =
has to be professionally formatted, translated into accessible language, ex=
plain why this solution and not the cheaper one, include photos with annota=
tions, be persuasive enough to win the job. Her expertise took 20 minutes. =
Documenting her expertise took 2.5 hours.
That ratio has been the problem. That=E2=80=99s been the bottleneck. That=
=E2=80=99s what doesn=E2=80=99t scale.
And this is true everywhere. A senior attorney knows the legal strategy in =
minutes but takes hours to write the brief. Even with a paralegal, getting =
the intent down and getting it polished takes forever. The doctor knows the=
 diagnosis but completing the chart note takes time. The architect knows th=
e design solution but creating the presentation takes much, much longer.
Your brain works fast. Documentation works slow.
The fourth way=E2=80=94the AI way=E2=80=94attacks that bottleneck directly.=
 It separates your expertise from the documentation of that expertise. And =
once you see the pattern, you recognize it everywhere.
The Universal Pattern: Sarah=E2=80=99s Story
Let me walk you through how this actually works with one complete example. =
Once you see the pattern here, you=E2=80=99ll recognize how it applies to w=
hatever domain you work in.
Sarah runs a residential HVAC business in the suburbs. She=E2=80=99s excell=
ent at her work=E2=80=9415 years of experience, knows the equipment cold, c=
an diagnose a struggling system in 20 minutes flat. Her constraint was neve=
r expertise. It was estimates.
Here=E2=80=99s what her old workflow looked like. She=E2=80=99d do a site v=
isit and diagnosis in 45 minutes, then spend 2.5 hours writing the estimate=
=2E That meant an opening letter explai=
ning the problem, a line-item breakdow=
n with justifications for each cost, an explanation of why this solution in=
stead of cheaper alternatives, photos with annotations showing what she fou=
nd, and an explanation of financing options.
Total time per estimate: over 3 hours. She could write maybe 5 estimates pe=
r week, which meant 15 hours of writing time. With a 35% close rate, she wa=
s winning about 1.75 jobs per week.
Sarah is an expert, not a writer. But homeowners need professional, detaile=
d estimates that build trust and explain technical work in accessible langu=
age. The translation from =E2=80=9CI know exactly what this house needs=E2=
=80=9D to =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s a document that wins the job=E2=80=9D too=
k longer than the diagnosis itself.
Here=E2=80=99s what her new workflow looks like. The site visit and diagnos=
is still take 45 minutes=E2=80=94that hasn=E2=80=99t changed and shouldn=E2=
=80=99t change, because that=E2=80=99s where her expertise matters.
But now, after the inspection, she records a 5-minute voice memo. =E2=80=9C=
Three-bedroom ranch, current unit is 2-ton from 2008, struggling to cool se=
cond floor in summer. System is undersized for square footage, ductwork loo=
ks original and has leaks in the attic runs. Recommend 3-ton high-efficienc=
y unit, ductwork sealing and two additional returns for better air circulat=
ion. Will improve comfort and cut their energy bills by about 30%. House ha=
s good insulation so this should solve it.=E2=80=9D
Then she spends 2 minutes giving AI a prompt. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m an HVAC =
contractor. Turn these notes into a professional estimate for a homeowner. =
Explain why the upgrade is necessary without using technical jargon. Emphas=
ize comfort improvements and energy savings. Include a section on why prope=
r sizing matters. Tone should be reassuring and educational, not salesy.=E2=
=80=9D
Then she drives to her next site visit while AI works. She reviews the outp=
ut in about 8 minutes, adding her pricing for labor and materials and timel=
ine, inserting her photos, adjusting any technical details AI got slightly =
wrong, and tweaking the tone if needed. Final review and send takes another=
 5 minutes.
Total time: 20 minutes of writing work.
Now she writes 25 estimates per week instead of 5. That=E2=80=99s 8 hours o=
f writing instead of 15, which frees up 7 hours. Her close rate stayed at 3=
5%=E2=80=94same quality, same trust-building, just faster. But 25 estimates=
 at 35% means 8.75 won jobs per week instead of 1.75. She 5x=E2=80=99d her =
opportunity pipeline by removing the documentation bottleneck.
Here=E2=80=99s what matters in this example: AI didn=E2=80=99t replace her =
expertise.
The diagnosis is hers=E2=80=94that system is undersized, the ductwork has p=
roblems, these are professional judgments earned over 15 years. The solutio=
n is hers=E2=80=943-ton unit, ductwork sealing, additional returns, this is=
 technical expertise. The pricing is hers=E2=80=94she knows her costs, her =
market, her margins. The relationship is hers=E2=80=94this is still Sarah t=
alking to her customer, building trust through transparency. And quality co=
ntrol is hers=E2=80=94she reviews every estimate, catches technical errors,=
 ensures accuracy.
What AI handles is the paralegal work, the apprentice work, the junior asso=
ciate work. The structure: professional format, logical flow, proper sectio=
ns. The translation: technical knowledge into homeowner language. The persu=
asion: why this matters, why not the cheaper option, what the benefits are.=
 The consistency: every estimate is polished, thorough, professional.
Sarah=E2=80=99s expertise stopped being trapped by the documentation bottle=
neck. That=E2=80=99s the breakthrough, and that=E2=80=99s the pattern that =
works everywhere.
The Same Pattern Across Every Domain
Once you see the pattern, you recognize it in every field where expertise i=
s the product. The bottleneck is always the same: translating expertise int=
o deliverables. The workflow is always the same: you provide judgment and f=
acts, AI provides structure and polish. What changes is the domain-specific=
 application.
Legal Work
A commercial litigation attorney spends 6 hours drafting responses to inter=
rogatories. She knows the facts, knows the strategy, knows what to say and =
what to protect. But translating =E2=80=9Cwe deny this, we admit that, here=
=E2=80=99s why=E2=80=9D into properly formatted, citable, formal legal docu=
ments takes forever.
Now she spends 30 minutes outlining her responses=E2=80=94what to admit, wh=
at to deny, what objections to raise, what facts to cite=E2=80=94gives AI t=
he structure and tone requirements, reviews the output for accuracy and pri=
vilege issues, and sends it in 90 minutes total.
What she still owns: legal strategy, privilege decisions, factual accuracy,=
 risk assessment, client interests. This is the practice of law. What AI ha=
ndles: citation format, formal legal language, document structure, consiste=
nt tone across 50 interrogatory responses.
Discovery responses that used to take all day Friday now take Friday mornin=
g. She handles 4x more matters without compromising quality, bills for expe=
rtise instead of document formatting.
Medical Work
A family physician sees patients all morning, then spends two hours after c=
linic completing charts. She knows the diagnosis, knows the treatment plan,=
 knows what happened in the appointment. But translating =E2=80=9Cpatient p=
resents with X, diagnosed Y, prescribed Z=E2=80=9D into proper SOAP notes, =
insurance-friendly language, and complete documentation steals hours from p=
atient care.
During or immediately after each appointment, she records brief bullet poin=
ts. AI structures these into complete documentation following her template =
and clinic standards. She reviews for clinical accuracy and signs off. Post=
-clinic documentation drops from 2 hours to 20 minutes.
What she still owns: diagnosis, treatment decisions, clinical judgment, pat=
ient safety, prescription decisions. This is the practice of medicine. What=
 AI handles: formatting notes into proper structure, translating shorthand =
into complete sentences, ensuring documentation meets insurance requirement=
s, maintaining consistent template structure.
A physician who saw 20 patients per day now sees 24=E2=80=94not because app=
ointments are shorter, but because documentation no longer creates a ceilin=
g on capacity. Or she keeps the same patient load and leaves on time instea=
d of staying late to finish charts.
Ecommerce
An Amazon FBA seller spots a trending product category but can=E2=80=99t mo=
ve fast because learning the category, researching competitors, writing 20 =
optimized product descriptions, and understanding customer language takes w=
eeks. By the time she=E2=80=99s ready to list, the opportunity window might=
 be closing.
Now she researches the top products in a category in 2 hours, identifies ga=
ps and opportunities, sources products from her existing suppliers, then gi=
ves AI her product specs plus competitive research. She has 20 listings wri=
tten and optimized in a day and tests the category while it=E2=80=99s still=
 hot.
What she still owns: product selection, pricing strategy, supplier relation=
ships, inventory management, competitive positioning. What AI handles: prod=
uct descriptions, keyword optimization, A+ content, comparison tables, bene=
fit-focused copy, multiple variations.
She used to operate in 2-3 categories she knew deeply. Now she tests 10+ ca=
tegories per quarter. Most don=E2=80=99t work, but the winners more than co=
ver the failures. The game changed from =E2=80=9Cexpertise in one niche=E2=
=80=9D to =E2=80=9Crapid testing across niches.=E2=80=9D Her advantage is v=
elocity.
Real Estate
An agent can only serve 8 clients simultaneously because every listing requ=
ires multiple deliverables=E2=80=94property description, social media posts=
, email campaigns, CMA narratives, open house materials, buyer follow-ups. =
She has the market knowledge and relationship skills to serve 20 clients, b=
ut content creation is the ceiling.
When she gets a new listing, she takes photos and notes key details in 15 m=
inutes. AI generates the listing description, social posts, email announcem=
ent, and open house materials simultaneously. What used to take 3 hours per=
 listing takes 30 minutes.
What she still owns: property valuation, negotiation, client relationships,=
 market knowledge. What AI handles: listing copy, social media content, ema=
il campaigns, market update newsletters, CMA narratives, follow-up sequence=
s.
She serves 20+ active clients simultaneously. Her close rate stays high bec=
ause the quality of materials stayed high=E2=80=94she just removed the time=
 constraint. More clients, same expertise, same service level. Revenue trip=
led without hiring an assistant.
The pattern holds everywhere. Your expertise is the valuable part. The docu=
mentation layer was the constraint. AI removed it.
Four Principles That Make This Work
These principles work whether you=E2=80=99re in tech or not in tech, whethe=
r you=E2=80=99re practicing law or installing systems or writing code. Once=
 you understand them, you can apply this pattern to your own domain.
First principle: expertise compounds, documentation doesn=E2=80=99t. You ge=
t better at your craft every year. You see patterns faster. You make decisi=
ons with more confidence. This is why business studies show expertise peaki=
ng much later in career arcs than people realize=E2=80=94into your 50s and =
beyond. But writing still takes the same amount of time.
AI makes documentation compound with your expertise. That=E2=80=99s the bre=
akthrough. Your knowledge keeps growing, and now your output can keep pace =
with it.
Second principle: quality control lives with you. The lawyer still reviews =
for legal accuracy and privilege issues. The doctor checks the diagnosis an=
d treatment appropriateness. You don=E2=80=99t outsource your judgment. You=
 outsource the translation. AI can draft, but you=E2=80=99re still the prof=
essional responsible for what gets delivered.
Third principle: the 80-20 threshold. AI will get you 80% of the way much, =
much faster than any other method. Faster than a paralegal, faster than a n=
urse taking notes, faster than any apprentice. But that last 20% requires y=
our expertise, and that=E2=80=99s exactly where you want to be spending you=
r time.
You want to get hands-on with your business in the right way. You need to s=
et up the prompt and the context to make sure AI delivers the right 80%, th=
en you apply your expertise to the remaining 20% that actually requires you=
r judgment.
Fourth principle: context is your multiplier. This is the secret to making =
everything else work. The better you can articulate what you need, the bett=
er the output. If you just say =E2=80=9Cwrite an estimate,=E2=80=9D it=E2=
=80=99s not going to be great. If you just say =E2=80=9Cwrite a generic NDA=
,=E2=80=9D it=E2=80=99s not going to be great.
Your ability to articulate what you need in structured, templatized context=
 forms is your superpower. You want to be able to say: this is what I need,=
 this is the context you need for this task, this is the context you need a=
bout me, this is the context you need about the client or the patient or wh=
oever the reader is, and this is my expectation for this draft specifically=
=2E The more clear you can be, the more=
 likely you are to get the right 80% a=
nd have only the important 20% left to touch.
That volume you get to creates more optionality for you.
And that=E2=80=99s the real payoff. When documentation was the bottleneck, =
you turned down work. You could only scale your time so far. By attacking t=
his bottleneck, you unlock optionality because your expertise is no longer =
the constraint. That=E2=80=99s the 10x return that AI delivers that none of=
 the older scaling levers could touch.
How to Actually Do This
The framework is universal. The implementation is domain-specific. Here=E2=
=80=99s how to start.
Step One: Pick Your Bottleneck
Identify the one repetitive task where you spend hours translating expertis=
e into deliverables. Common candidates:
Discovery responses and client letters in legal work
Patient documentation and insurance letters in medical work
Estimates and change orders in trades
Product descriptions and customer service responses in ecommerce
Listings and CMAs in real estate
Design docs and RFCs in engineering
Client reports and proposals in consulting
Choose the task you do weekly that takes 2+ hours but doesn=E2=80=99t requi=
re your highest-level expertise to document.
Step Two: Learn the Context Formula
AI needs four things to produce professional output: your role, your audien=
ce, your goal, and your constraints.
For a family law attorney, that might look like: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a fam=
ily law attorney drafting a response to discovery interrogatories. The audi=
ence is opposing counsel and potentially a judge. I need to answer these qu=
estions while protecting privilege and avoiding admissions. Tone should be =
formal and cautious. Here are my notes on each interrogatory.=E2=80=9D
For a family physician: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a family physician documenting=
 a patient visit. This needs to follow SOAP note format for insurance purpo=
ses. The patient is a 45-year-old with Type 2 diabetes presenting for follo=
w-up. Here are my visit notes. Make this complete and insurance-friendly wh=
ile staying clinically accurate.=E2=80=9D
For a general contractor: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a general contractor writing=
 an estimate for a kitchen remodel. The homeowner is price-sensitive but va=
lues quality. I need to explain why certain choices=E2=80=94structural work=
, permits, quality materials=E2=80=94are necessary and not just upsells. To=
ne should be educational and reassuring. Here=E2=80=99s what the job requir=
es.=E2=80=9D
The pattern is always the same: establish who you are, who you=E2=80=99re w=
riting for, what you=E2=80=99re trying to accomplish, and what constraints =
matter. The better you get at articulating this context, the better AI perf=
orms.
Step Three: Use the Iteration Pattern
Professional output rarely comes from one prompt. Think of this as a conver=
sation, not a command. You get the first draft from your initial prompt. Th=
en you refine:
Make the second paragraph more specific about timeline
This sounds too salesy, make it more educational
Include a line about code compliance requirements
Shorten this by 20% without losing key points
You=E2=80=99re collaborating with a very fast assistant who needs direction=
=2E Give it.
Step Four: Know What to Verify
Every domain has critical elements that you must check yourself. AI can dra=
ft, but you=E2=80=99re still the professional.
In legal work, check:
Factual accuracy=E2=80=94AI cannot know your case specifics
Privilege issues=E2=80=94nothing protected should be revealed
Jurisdiction-specific rules=E2=80=94statutes, case law, procedures
Strategy decisions=E2=80=94what to admit, what to contest
In medical work, check:
Diagnosis accuracy
Treatment appropriateness
Drug interactions and dosages
Patient-specific history=E2=80=94AI doesn=E2=80=99t have full context
In trades, check:
Code compliance
Safety requirements
Pricing accuracy
Site-specific conditions=E2=80=94you saw it, AI didn=E2=80=99t
In ecommerce, check:
Product specifications
Verify claims
Competitive accuracy
Brand voice
In real estate, check:
Square footage and property details
Verify comparable sales data
Confirm disclosure requirements
Avoid fair housing violations
In engineering, check:
Technical accuracy
Security implications
Performance claims
Operational concerns
The principle is simple: AI handles the translation layer, but the expertis=
e layer is yours. Never outsource what requires professional judgment.
Step Five: Start Small, Then Scale
Weeks 1-2: Use AI for one task only. Get comfortable with the workflow. Lea=
rn how to prompt for your domain.
Weeks 3-4: Add a second task type. Start seeing the time savings compound.
Month 2: Expand to all appropriate documentation tasks and calculate your a=
ctual time savings.
Month 3: Reinvest the freed time. Take on more clients, improve service qua=
lity, or just leave on time.
The goal isn=E2=80=99t to use AI for everything. It=E2=80=99s to remove the=
 bottleneck between your expertise and your deliverables.
Your Domain Here
Don=E2=80=99t see your field in the examples above? The pattern works every=
where. Here=E2=80=99s how to map it to what you do.
Accounting or tax preparation. The bottleneck is client reports and tax str=
ategy explanations. The unlock is turning numbers into narrative in minutes=
=2E You still own tax strategy, complia=
nce, and calculation accuracy. AI hand=
les translating P&L into client insights, explanation letters, and year-end=
 summaries.
Architecture or engineering. The bottleneck is project documentation and cl=
ient presentations. The unlock is turning technical specifications into per=
suasive proposals. You still own design decisions, code compliance, and str=
uctural calculations. AI handles RFP responses, client-facing narratives, a=
nd translating technical details into accessible language.
Education or training. The bottleneck is lesson plans, assessments, and dif=
ferentiated materials. The unlock is taking one concept and creating multip=
le formats and levels instantly. You still own pedagogical expertise, stude=
nt assessment, and curriculum goals. AI handles creating variations, format=
ting materials, and parent communications.
Non-profit or fundraising. The bottleneck is grant applications and donor c=
ommunications. The unlock is turning mission into compelling narratives at =
scale. You still own program expertise, impact measurement, and donor relat=
ionships. AI handles tailoring stories to different funders, application fo=
rmatting, and appeal letters.
Consulting in any domain. The bottleneck is client deliverables and proposa=
ls. The unlock is turning strategic insights into polished documents. You s=
till own client diagnosis, recommendations, and expertise. AI handles struc=
turing slide decks, writing reports, and formatting frameworks.
Hospitality or events. The bottleneck is event documentation and vendor coo=
rdination. The unlock is turning logistics into professional communications=
=2E You still own creative vision, vend=
or relationships, and day-of execution=
=2E AI handles proposals, timelines, gu=
est communications, vendor briefs, and=
 post-event summaries.
Financial advisory. The bottleneck is client investment reports and explana=
tions. The unlock is turning portfolio data into personalized insights. You=
 still own investment strategy, risk assessment, and fiduciary responsibili=
ty. AI handles market commentary, portfolio narratives, and client educatio=
n materials.
Insurance in any type. The bottleneck is policy explanations and claims doc=
umentation. The unlock is turning coverage into client-understandable expla=
nations. You still own risk assessment, policy recommendations, and claims =
decisions. AI handles coverage summaries, claims letters, and policy compar=
ison documents.
See the pattern? First, identify your bottleneck=E2=80=94what takes time bu=
t doesn=E2=80=99t require your highest-level expertise? Second, map the wor=
kflow=E2=80=94you provide expertise, facts, and judgment while AI provides =
structure, polish, and translation. Third, keep what matters=E2=80=94domain=
 compliance, client relationships, professional judgment. Fourth, scale wha=
t doesn=E2=80=99t=E2=80=94writing, formatting, translating expertise into d=
eliverables.
If you can explain your work to a smart intern or new hire, you can explain=
 it to AI.
The Economic Reality
Let=E2=80=99s be direct about what this means financially.
If you bill hourly, you=E2=80=99re billing for expertise, not documentation=
 time. AI doesn=E2=80=99t change what you charge=E2=80=94it changes how man=
y billable hours you can actually deliver.
If you work on commission or contingency, volume matters. More proposals, m=
ore pitches, more listings means more closings. AI removes the constraint o=
n volume without sacrificing quality.
If you run a service business, capacity is the limiting factor. You can onl=
y serve X clients before quality drops. AI raises that ceiling by removing =
the documentation bottleneck.
If you=E2=80=99re in a marketplace business, speed is competitive advantage=
=2E First to market wins. AI makes you faster.
The expertise is the valuable thing. The documentation was the constraint. =
AI removed it.
What you do with that is up to you. Some people will handle 10x more client=
s. Others will serve the same number of clients but deliver higher quality =
and leave on time. Both are winning moves.
The competitive window is finite. Right now, most professionals in your fie=
ld aren=E2=80=99t doing this systematically. They=E2=80=99re still treating=
 AI like a curiosity rather than a capability multiplier. That won=E2=80=99=
t last.
Twelve months from now, clients will expect this level of responsiveness an=
d polish as baseline. Early adopters will have established the workflow, bu=
ilt the prompt library, and integrated AI into their practice. Late adopter=
s will be playing catch-up.
The breakthrough isn=E2=80=99t the technology. It=E2=80=99s the realization=
 that your expertise can finally scale without hiring, without cutting corn=
ers, without burning out.
Start with one task. Use it for two weeks. Then decide if you want to scale=
 it.
Your expertise is worth more than your typing time. Now prove it.
Wait, This Works for Engineers Too?
Here=E2=80=99s the irony: while everyone=E2=80=99s focused on AI writing co=
de, senior engineers have a different bottleneck entirely. The gap isn=E2=
=80=99t technical knowledge=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s translating that knowledge=
 into communication.
For a senior engineer or architect, the bottleneck is RFC documents, design=
 docs, and architecture decision records. The unlock is turning technical d=
ecisions into persuasive documentation. What you own: architecture choices,=
 tradeoff analysis, technical judgment, system design. What AI handles: str=
ucturing the argument, translating for mixed audiences of engineering, prod=
uct, and executives.
For a tech lead or engineering manager, the bottleneck is performance revie=
ws, 1:1 notes, hiring documentation, and team updates. The unlock is turnin=
g observations into structured feedback in minutes. What you own: people ju=
dgment, career development, team dynamics, hiring decisions. What AI handle=
s: turning bullet points into developmental feedback and calibration docume=
nts.
For DevRel or solutions engineers, the bottleneck is tutorials, documentati=
on, and customer-facing explanations. The unlock is turning technical knowl=
edge into accessible learning materials at scale. What you own: deep techni=
cal expertise and knowing what actually matters. What AI handles: multiple =
explanation levels, different learning formats, and example variations.
For CTOs or VPs of Engineering, the bottleneck is board updates, investor c=
ommunications, and strategy documents. The unlock is turning technical real=
ity into executive narrative. What you own: strategic vision, technical ris=
k assessment, roadmap decisions. What AI handles: translating engineering c=
onstraints into business language.
The pattern holds: your deep expertise is the valuable part. The documentat=
ion and communication layer is the bottleneck. AI removes it.
You already knew AI could help junior developers write code. But it can hel=
p you scale the parts of your job that aren=E2=80=99t coding=E2=80=94which,=
 at senior levels, is most of it. A principal engineer spending 8 hours wri=
ting a design doc that 3 people will skim isn=E2=80=99t a good use of a $30=
0K/year brain. The design thinking is the valuable part. The LaTeX formatti=
ng and prose polish isn=E2=80=99t.
Senior technical roles are communication-heavy. AI just made that communica=
tion 10x faster.

=E2=80=99s the translation layer. You can diagnose a problem in minutes, bu=

rn-matching engines trained on billions of examples of professional documen=
tation. They=E2=80=99ve seen thousands of legal briefs, medical charts, pro=
ject proposals, and estimates. They know the structure, the format, the pro=

s the problem that nobody talks about: expertise is the one thing in busine=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Option one: work more hours. You=E2=80=99re a lawyer, client demand go=
es up, so you work nights and weekends until you burn out. This doesn=E2=80=
=99t scale because there=E2=80=99s not infinite time in the day.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">Option two: hire people. You bring on associates, junior lawyers, app=
rentices=E2=80=94whoever. But they don=E2=80=99t scale expertise, they dilu=
te it. The junior person isn=E2=80=99t you. They don=E2=80=99t have the yea=
rs of pattern recognition that come with real expertise. Every piece of wor=
k they touch needs review by someone who actually knows what they=E2=80=99r=
e doing. You end up trading your actual work for management work, and you=
=E2=80=99re still the bottleneck.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Option three: raise your =
prices. You charge $600 an hour, then $1,000 an hour. But there=E2=80=99s a=
 ceiling. Eventually you=E2=80=99re too expensive for most clients, and you=
=E2=80=99ve traded volume for rate while still being limited by time.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

product, your expertise hits a scaling wall. Your knowledge is the asset, a=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">These principles work whether you=E2=80=99re in tech or not in te=
ch, whether you=E2=80=99re practicing law or installing systems or writing =
code. Once you understand them, you can apply this pattern to your own doma=
in.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;"><strong>First principle: expertise compounds, documenta=
tion doesn=E2=80=99t.</strong><span> You get better at your craft every yea=
r. You see patterns faster. You make decisions with more confidence. This i=
s why business studies show expertise peaking much later in career arcs tha=
n people realize=E2=80=94into your 50s and beyond. But writing still takes =
the same amount of time.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=

gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><s=
trong>Second principle: quality control lives with you.</strong><span> The =
lawyer still reviews for legal accuracy and privilege issues. The doctor ch=
ecks the diagnosis and treatment appropriateness. You don=E2=80=99t outsour=
ce your judgment. You outsource the translation. AI can draft, but you=E2=
=80=99re still the professional responsible for what gets delivered.</span>=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;"><strong>Third principle: the 80-20 threshold.</strong><spa=
n> AI will get you 80% of the way much, much faster than any other method. =
Faster than a paralegal, faster than a nurse taking notes, faster than any =
apprentice. But that last 20% requires your expertise, and that=E2=80=99s e=
xactly where you want to be spending your time.</span></p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">You =
want to get hands-on with your business in the right way. You need to set u=
p the prompt and the context to make sure AI delivers the right 80%, then y=
ou apply your expertise to the remaining 20% that actually requires your ju=
dgment.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height:=
 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Fourth principle: context is your multiplie=
r.</strong><span> This is the secret to making everything else work. The be=
tter you can articulate what you need, the better the output. If you just s=
ay =E2=80=9Cwrite an estimate,=E2=80=9D it=E2=80=99s not going to be great.=
 If you just say =E2=80=9Cwrite a generic NDA,=E2=80=9D it=E2=80=99s not go=

55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Your ability to articulate what you=
 need in structured, templatized context forms is your superpower. You want=
 to be able to say: this is what I need, this is the context you need for t=
his task, this is the context you need about me, this is the context you ne=
ed about the client or the patient or whoever the reader is, and this is my=
 expectation for this draft specifically. The more clear you can be, the mo=
re likely you are to get the right 80% and have only the important 20% left=
 to touch.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=

: 26px;font-size: 16px;">And that=E2=80=99s the real payoff. When documenta=
tion was the bottleneck, you turned down work. You could only scale your ti=
me so far. By attacking this bottleneck, you unlock optionality because you=
r expertise is no longer the constraint. That=E2=80=99s the 10x return that=
