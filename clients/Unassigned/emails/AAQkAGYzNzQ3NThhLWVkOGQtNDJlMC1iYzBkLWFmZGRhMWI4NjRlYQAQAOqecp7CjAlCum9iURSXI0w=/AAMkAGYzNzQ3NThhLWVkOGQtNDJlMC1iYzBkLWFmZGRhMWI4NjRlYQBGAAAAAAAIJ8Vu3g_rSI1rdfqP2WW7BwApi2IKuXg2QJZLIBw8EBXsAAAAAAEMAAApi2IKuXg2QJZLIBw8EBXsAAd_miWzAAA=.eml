That MIT study really is viral. I think the internet likes doom and gloom h=
eadlines (big surprise there).
Just look at Google!
Basically the same dark headline over and over again. Everyone=E2=80=99s re=
ading the MIT study as some sort of nail in the coffin of AI projects every=
where. But no one is digging under the headlines.
I couldn=E2=80=99t find anything digging deeper into why the AI projects in=
 the study worked or didn=E2=80=99t, and no one at all asking if that actua=
lly connected with the real world experience of builders.
You know, the people who actually build those AI projects we all talk about=
? Engineers. Vibe coders. AI enthusiasts from all backgrounds. You!
MIT didn=E2=80=99t bother to talk to them. They just interviewed 150 execs =
and called it good. And that right there is exactly why the study failed. I=
t=E2=80=99s why the lessons learned felt generic. And somewhat contradictor=
y, like they were out of touch with how AI projects are actually implemente=
d on the ground. Because they were!
So I dug deeper. I acutally analyzed the report in depth, I pulled out the =
report=E2=80=99s insights, and I cross-checked every one against how I=E2=
=80=99ve actually seen AI play out in the real world, the world of builders=
=2E=20
And I realized that we need a builder=E2=80=99s playbook that actually trac=
ks the real world problems and real world success patterns. We need a playb=
ook with teeth that shows builders how to go from playing hero on individua=
l teams to building AI systems that actually work.
And that=E2=80=99s what this is. A deep dive into how AI projects actually =
work, with actionable build principles you can apply tomorrow.=20
Fair warning: if you're looking for "10 tips to AI success" or "why executi=
ves should embrace AI," you're in the wrong place. This is about the nitty-=
gritty of making AI work when everyone around you is either panicking about=
 the bubble or drunk on hype.
Let's dig in.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
The 95% AI Failure Rate is Actually Good News (If You're a Builder)
Everyone's sharing that MIT study about 95% of enterprise AI failing. I spe=
nt six hours reading it, plus every rebuttal, critique, and LinkedIn hot ta=
ke. Then I spent another six hours digging through real implementation stor=
ies from Spotify, IBM, Atlassian, and a dozen other companies.
Here's what I learned: MIT got the failure rate right but the reasons compl=
etely wrong.
They interviewed 150 executives about their AI initiatives. Executives! Tha=
t's like asking hospital administrators why surgeries fail without talking =
to a single surgeon. Of course they missed what actually matters.
The real story isn't in boardrooms. It's in the shadow AI workflows your ac=
counting team secretly shares. It's in the confidence scores that made lawy=
ers suddenly trust AI drafting. It's in the RAG system that went from usele=
ss to essential because someone actually tracked what led to closed deals.
I've watched this pattern too many times now. Company announces AI initiati=
ve with fanfare. Six months later, it's dead. Meanwhile, three floors down,=
 someone's ChatGPT workflow is quietly saving their team 10 hours a week. T=
he disconnect is almost comedic.
So I did what the MIT researchers didn't=E2=80=94I looked at what builders =
actually built. Not the PowerPoints, not the vendor contracts, but the syst=
ems that stuck. The patterns are remarkably consistent. And they have nothi=
ng to do with whether you "buy or build" (MIT's big conclusion) and everyth=
ing to do with whether you understand how AI systems actually take root in =
organizations.
I'm going to save you those hours of research and show you the five technic=
al principles that separate the 5% who succeed from everyone else. Not exec=
utive frameworks. Not vendor pitches. The actual architectural patterns tha=
t determine whether your AI implementation becomes essential infrastructure=
 or another dead pilot.
What MIT Measured (And Why It's Wrong)
The study made four critical errors that explain why their conclusions don'=
t match what I see in actual implementations:
First, they only measured six-month P&L impact. I've never seen a meaningfu=
l AI system deliver ROI that fast. The successful implementations I know to=
ok 12-18 months to hit their stride. Six months is barely enough time to ge=
t past the "wow, ChatGPT can write emails" phase.
Second, they only interviewed C-suite executives. These are people who see =
vendor contracts and pilot dashboards, not the guerrilla ChatGPT workflow t=
hat's actually saving the sales team four hours a week. The gap between wha=
t executives think is happening with AI and what's actually happening is as=
tronomical.
Third, they pushed a false "buy versus build" binary. Every successful impl=
ementation I've seen is hybrid=E2=80=94organizations need both vendor depen=
dability and a willingness to build to succeed. They leverage OpenAI's mode=
ls but build their own context management. Pure vendor solutions fail. Pure=
 custom builds fail. Reality lives in between.
Fourth, they correctly identified that workflow integration matters but off=
ered zero guidance on how to actually do it. "AI should adapt to enterprise=
 workflows" is about as useful as saying "food should taste good." True, bu=
t how?
Quick Self-Assessment: Are You in the 5% or 95%?
Yes, we=E2=80=99re going to do this without revenue! Not because revenue do=
esn=E2=80=99t matter, but because revenue isn=E2=80=99t a leading indicator=
 for builders.
Answer honestly:
=E2=98=90 Do you instrument a wide suite of AI leading indicators, not just=
 usage numbers?
=E2=98=90 Have you done a shadow AI audit in the last 60 days?
=E2=98=90 Can your AI system get better without a full retrain?
=E2=98=90 Do users voluntarily adopt your tool (no mandates)?
=E2=98=90 Can you explain which AI workflows really matter to a 12 year old=
?
=E2=98=90 Is your AI system so accurate and quick that stakeholders assume =
it just works?
Scoring:
5-6 Yes: You're in the 5%
3-4 Yes: You're close=E2=80=94focus on the gaps
0-2 Yes: You're building theater, not infrastructure
It=E2=80=99s ok, most projects start out at at 0-2. Want to see how to actu=
ally build systems that work? Read on=E2=80=A6
The Five Principles That Actually Drive AI Success
While executives debate vendor contracts, builders keep discovering the sam=
e patterns independently. I see people stumbling into these principles over=
 and over, usually after their third failed pilot. Here are the five techni=
cal patterns that separate the 5% from the 95%:
Principle 1: Hybrid Architectures Are Mandatory
Forget the buy versus build debate. Every successful AI implementation I've=
 seen is hybrid. You're not choosing between Microsoft's Copilot and rollin=
g your own. You're using Anthropic's models with your own orchestration lay=
er. You're combining OpenAI for creative tasks with a fine-tuned Llama for =
structured data extraction.
The companies succeeding treat AI vendors like AWS=E2=80=94powerful infrast=
ructure that needs careful integration, not magic solutions. They recognize=
 that even when you "buy," you're buying work. There's no such thing as a p=
lug-and-play AI solution that actually delivers value.
Spotify's engineering team learned this the hard way. Their first attempt w=
as pure vendor solution. Failed. Second attempt was pure custom build. Also=
 failed. Their third attempt=E2=80=94documented in their engineering blog=
=E2=80=94combined best-in-class models with custom workflow logic. That's w=
hen developer productivity jumped 26%.
The key insight: you need the power of frontier models but the control of c=
ustom logic. You can't have one without the other and succeed.
Principle 2: Build Learning Systems, Not Static Deployments
The difference between a POC and production isn't scale=E2=80=94it's whethe=
r the system gets better over time. This means three specific things:
Feedback loops: Every interaction should make the next interaction better. =
When a user corrects an output, that correction feeds back into the system.=
 When a draft leads to a closed deal, that pattern gets reinforced.
Retraining pipelines: Not full model retraining (that's expensive and usual=
ly unnecessary), but continuous fine-tuning of prompts and context based on=
 actual usage patterns. The system that worked in January won't work in Jun=
e without updates.
Context persistence: The system needs memory across sessions. That chatbot =
that answers HR questions? Useless. The one that remembers what confused pe=
ople last month and preemptively clarifies? Essential.
I watched a sales team implement this. Their first RAG system was static=E2=
=80=94it pulled from their knowledge base but never evolved. Six months lat=
er, it was giving the same outdated answers. Their second attempt logged ev=
ery question, tracked which answers led to closed deals, and continuously r=
efined its responses. New sales reps were performing like three-year vetera=
ns within weeks. That's a learning system.
Principle 3: Intelligent Friction Builds Trust
Everyone thinks AI should be frictionless. Nope. MIT got this one right, ac=
tually. The implementations that stick have deliberate friction in smart pl=
aces. Here's what intelligent friction actually looks like:
Confidence thresholds: Show users when the model is guessing. McGuireWoods =
and LexisNexis proved this with their legal AI=E2=80=94color-coding contrac=
t clauses by confidence (green/yellow/red) increased adoption from 25% to 7=
2% in three months. Lawyers loved knowing exactly where to focus their atte=
ntion.
Human review gates: Not everything needs human review, but high-stakes deci=
sions do. The trick is making these gates feel empowering, not insulting. S=
how users why something triggered review. Let them adjust thresholds. Give =
them override authority with audit trails.
Graceful degradation: When the model operates outside its training distribu=
tion, it should say so. "I haven't seen this pattern before, here's my best=
 guess but please verify" beats confidently wrong every time.
IBM's research found that companies with intelligent friction had 60% lower=
 error rates and, counterintuitively, 3x higher user satisfaction. Users tr=
ust systems that acknowledge their limitations.
Principle 4: Instrumentation Provides Leading Indicators
Executives wait six months to check P&L. Builders who succeed track technic=
al metrics daily that predict business outcomes months in advance. Here's w=
hat actually matters:
Accuracy by category: Not overall accuracy=E2=80=94accuracy per use case. Y=
our contract review might be 95% accurate while your compliance checks are =
60%. You need to know.
Latency percentiles: Not average latency=E2=80=94p50, p95, and p99 if you=
=E2=80=99re operating at real scale. Treat it like serving streaming video.
Override rates: The golden metric. When you let the user override, and over=
ride rates drop from 60% to 20%, your system is learning. When override rat=
es spike, well that=E2=80=99s not great news and you should probably dig in=
to the pipeline to figure out what=E2=80=99s going on.
Error rates and patterns: Not just frequency but taxonomy. Are errors rando=
m or systematic? Are they clustered around specific inputs? This tells you =
whether to retrain or rebuild.
Look at this sample dashboard I knocked together in Claude [ https://substa=
ck.com/redirect/643cab09-e9ee-4fff-92fd-e37a9ef189cd?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In=
0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Notice what's missing? Van=
ity metrics. Notice what's there? Useful metrics you can drive a technical =
business against. Stuff like model accuracy rates. Override rates. Response=
 latency. When done right over time, those add up to ROI.
The lesson? Measure what you can drive.
Principle 5: Shadow AI Mining Uncovers What Actually Works
Here's the pattern nobody in the MIT study mentioned: the best AI implement=
ations don't start in boardrooms. They start when someone builds a GPT that=
 actually works and secretly shares it with their team.
Every organization has shadow AI right now. Someone in accounting has a Cla=
ude prompt that reconciles expenses perfectly. The marketing team passes ar=
ound a Perplexity workflow that beats your official research process. Custo=
mer success has a janky but effective chatbot they built in two hours that =
outperforms the vendor solution you paid $50k for.
Your job as a builder isn't to shut this down=E2=80=94it's to mine it for g=
old. Shadow AI is user research you didn't have to conduct. It's proof of c=
oncept with actual validation. It's your roadmap to the 5% that succeed.
Reco.ai's 400-day study found the average enterprise has 17 different shado=
w AI workflows in active use. The companies that succeeded didn't fight thi=
s=E2=80=94they formalized it. One B2B SaaS company turned their top two sha=
dow workflows into native features and saw 3x adoption versus their vendor =
pilot.
The process is simple: Survey. Document. Systematize. Scale. But you have t=
o be willing to admit that your users might have already solved the problem=
 better than your official solution.
What This Looks Like in Practice
The examples I referenced, let=E2=80=99s dive a bit deeper to get the detai=
ls.
How Spotify Built Confidence Scoring for GenAI
Spotify Engineering published a detailed case study on how they solved the =
trust problem in their GenAI applications. Their developers were spending w=
eeks prototyping features without clear paths to production.
Their solution incorporated all five principles: hybrid architecture (combi=
ning Copilot with custom logic), learning systems (weekly retraining based =
on merged PRs), intelligent friction (confidence scores on suggestions), in=
strumentation (tracking acceptance rates), and shadow AI formalization (bui=
lding on workflows developers already created).
According to their published metrics: developer productivity rose 26%, time=
 from prototype to merge fell 45%, and code quality improved 30%.
IBM's Study: Shadow AI Surge in Canadian Enterprises
IBM Research released a study in September 2025 showing that Canadian worke=
rs are outpacing their employers in AI adoption through shadow AI. They fou=
nd employees were 35% more likely to use unauthorized AI tools than officia=
l company solutions.
The key finding: organizations that conducted shadow AI audits and formaliz=
ed the top workflows saw 3x higher adoption rates than those pushing vendor=
 solutions. One bank discovered a compliance officer using custom GPT promp=
ts for AML detection=E2=80=94when they built this into a secure workflow wi=
th proper instrumentation and confidence scoring, review throughput increas=
ed 4x.
McGuireWoods and LexisNexis: The Legal Trust Journey
LexisNexis published research with McGuireWoods showing how confidence scor=
ing transformed legal AI adoption. They started with a standard RAG system=
=E2=80=9425% adoption after months of pushing.
Then they added intelligent friction: color-coded confidence scores on ever=
y clause. They instrumented everything, tracking which sections lawyers rev=
ised most. They built learning loops, retraining weekly on revision pattern=
s. Trust jumped to 72% in three months. Review cycles dropped 30%.
Atlassian's Documentation Revolution with Evidently AI
Evidently AI documented how Atlassian solved their documentation lag proble=
m using all five principles. They built a hybrid system (RAG plus custom up=
date detection), created learning loops (the system learned from writer edi=
ts), added intelligent friction (flagged low-confidence updates), instrumen=
ted everything (tracking doc accuracy by product area), and formalized shad=
ow workflows (writers were already using ChatGPT for summaries).
Result: Documentation lag shrank from two sprints to one day. User-reported=
 errors dropped 80%.
The Missing Skills to Become an AI Leader
If you want to translate these principles into organizational impact, you c=
an actually pull these principles into leadership skills you can practice t=
oday.
Shadow AI detective work: Learn to identify and document guerrilla workflow=
s. Run surveys. Watch Slack. Look for screenshots of ChatGPT. This is your =
goldmine.
Friction design: Engineer guardrails that build trust without destroying us=
ability. Know when to surface confidence scores, where to put human review =
gates, how to make limitations visible without creating alarm.
Learning system architecture: Design systems that improve with each interac=
tion. Capture feedback, persist context, create improvement loops that don'=
t require ML expertise to maintain.
Technical health monitoring: Track metrics that predict success before ROI =
appears. Explain why a 15% drop in override rate means you'll hit targets i=
n three months.
Context translation at scale: Turn your prompt expertise into templates oth=
ers can use. Build libraries that encode best practices without requiring e=
veryone to become prompt engineers.
And the good news is that by leaning in on these leadership principles you=
=E2=80=99re materially increasing the odds the business will actually build=
 AI systems that matter, that have teeth, that deliver real ROI. That=E2=80=
=99s how you beat the odds.
Ideas to get started
The MIT study says 95% fail. Fine. Here's how you join the 5% based on your=
 role:
Product Managers: Run a shadow AI survey this week using the Shadow AI Surv=
ey Template [ computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/shadow_ai_survey_template.m=
d ]. Document the top workflows exactly. Build native versions. Watch your =
metrics explode.
Engineers: Start instrumenting everything. Use the Builder's Success Checkl=
ist [ computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/builders_ai_success_checklist.md ] =
to track the right metrics. When something breaks, you'll know before users=
 complain.
Solo Founders: Pick one narrow workflow and nail it. Implement all five pri=
nciples on that one workflow. You can expand later.
Designers: Make AI's limitations visible without creating fear. Design conf=
idence indicators that help users trust appropriately.
Team Leads: Surface and celebrate shadow AI. Turn guerrilla success into of=
ficial infrastructure.
You get the idea. The point is your role doesn=E2=80=99t limit you here. Yo=
ur willingness to jump in and go beyond being a super-prompter is the key s=
kill to get started, and I=E2=80=99m giving you ideas about how to turn tha=
t willingness into concrete action here.
Yep, Don=E2=80=99t Panic
I=E2=80=99ve said it before! When the headlines are full of doom and gloom,=
 builders have opportunities.
While executives panic about ROI and vendors push magic solutions, you know=
 the five principles that actually work. You know hybrid architectures beat=
 pure approaches. You know learning systems outperform static deployments. =
You know intelligent friction builds trust. You know instrumentation predic=
ts success. You know shadow AI reveals what to build.
You don=E2=80=99t have to build one-off AI projects, and you don=E2=80=99t =
have to wait for your leaders to change to start influencing the business. =
Start engineering AI systems that learn, adapt, and deliver compound value.=
 You have advantages the MIT study didn't even consider. Use them.
The next time someone shares that "95% fail" headline, smile. You know some=
thing they don't. You know the five principles that put you in the 5%.

p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=
t-size: 16px;"><strong>First</strong><span>, they only measured six-month P=
&amp;L impact. I've never seen a meaningful AI system deliver ROI that fast=
. The successful implementations I know took 12-18 months to hit their stri=
de. Six months is barely enough time to get past the &quot;wow, ChatGPT can=
 write emails&quot; phase.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Second</strong><s=
pan>, they only interviewed C-suite executives. These are people who see ve=
ndor contracts and pilot dashboards, not the guerrilla ChatGPT workflow tha=
t's actually saving the sales team four hours a week. The gap between what =
executives think is happening with AI and what's actually happening is astr=
onomical.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Third</strong><span>, they pushed =
a false &quot;buy versus build&quot; binary. Every successful implementatio=
n I've seen is hybrid=E2=80=94organizations need both vendor dependability =
and a willingness to build to succeed. They leverage OpenAI's models but bu=

 Architectures Are Mandatory</h3><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(=
54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Forget the buy versus build d=
ebate. Every successful AI implementation I've seen is hybrid. You're not c=
hoosing between Microsoft's Copilot and rolling your own. You're using Anth=
ropic's models with your own orchestration layer. You're combining OpenAI f=
or creative tasks with a fine-tuned Llama for structured data extraction.</=
p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;fon=

owerful infrastructure that needs careful integration, not magic solutions.=
 They recognize that even when you &quot;buy,&quot; you're buying work. The=
re's no such thing as a plug-and-play AI solution that actually delivers va=

yle=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size:=
 16px;">The difference between a POC and production isn't scale=E2=80=94it'=

s:</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Feedback loops:</strong><span> Every interaction=
 should make the next interaction better. When a user corrects an output, t=
hat correction feeds back into the system. When a draft leads to a closed d=
eal, that pattern gets reinforced.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0=
;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;"><strong>Retrainin=

 usually unnecessary), but continuous fine-tuning of prompts and context ba=

in June without updates.</span></p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=

 be frictionless. Nope. MIT got this one right, actually. The implementatio=

someone builds a GPT that actually works and secretly shares it with their =
team.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 2=

n accounting has a Claude prompt that reconciles expenses perfectly. The ma=
rketing team passes around a Perplexity workflow that beats your official r=
