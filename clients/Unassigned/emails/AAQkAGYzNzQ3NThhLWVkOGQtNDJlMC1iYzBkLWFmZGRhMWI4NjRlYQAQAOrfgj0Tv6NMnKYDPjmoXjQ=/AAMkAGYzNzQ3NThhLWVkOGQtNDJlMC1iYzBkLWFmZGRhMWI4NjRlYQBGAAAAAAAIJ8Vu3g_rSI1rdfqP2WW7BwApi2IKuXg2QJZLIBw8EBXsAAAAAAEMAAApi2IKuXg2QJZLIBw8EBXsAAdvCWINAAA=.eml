Do I have to explain why this matters now? Maybe a screenshot is enough.

This is what happens with a billion people using AI collide with a corporat=
e culture notorious for pushing the edges for engagement [ https://substack=

We're at an inflection point with AI systems. They're no longer confined to=
 research labs or specialized applications=E2=80=94they're talking to our c=
hildren, shaping our information diet, making decisions about our lives. Th=
e question of how to make these systems behave ethically isn't academic any=
more. It's urgent.
This week's Meta scandal=E2=80=94where leaked internal guidelines showed th=
eir AI was permitted to have romantic conversations with children=E2=80=94i=
sn't just another tech company mishap. It's a window into how the industry =
currently approaches AI ethics, and why that approach is failing. More impo=
rtantly, it gives us a chance to examine what the alternative looks like.
I've been thinking about AI ethics for a while, but this piece represents m=
y deepest dive yet into the actual mechanics=E2=80=94not the philosophy or =
the policy debates, but the technical processes of training AI systems to b=
ehave ethically. I'm using Anthropic as a primary counterexample not becaus=
e they're perfect=E2=80=94they're not=E2=80=94but because they've been unus=
ually transparent about their approach and have published detailed papers o=
n their Constitutional AI methodology. When you're trying to understand how=
 something should work, it helps to have at least one example of someone tr=
ying to do it thoughtfully, even if imperfectly.
What follows is an examination of what went wrong at Meta, what the alterna=
tives look like, and why the gap between those two approaches matters for e=
veryone who interacts with AI systems=E2=80=94which increasingly means ever=
yone.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
Part 1: What Actually Happened at Meta
The leaked document was titled "GenAI: Content Risk Standards"=E2=80=94over=
 200 pages of guidelines for how Meta's AI chatbots should behave across Fa=
cebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Meta AI. Reuters obtained it and published=
 their investigation on August 14, 2025. What they found was genuinely shoc=
king, even for those of us who've become cynical about tech company behavio=
r.
The guidelines explicitly permitted AI chatbots to engage in what they call=
ed "romantic or sensual" conversations with children. The specific examples=
 Meta deemed acceptable are worth stating plainly, because the euphemistic =
language obscures how disturbing they are. The AI could tell a child "your =
youthful form is a work of art." It could say to an 8-year-old: "every inch=
 of you is a masterpiece =E2=80=93 a treasure I cherish deeply." When promp=
ted with "What are we to do, my dear? You know I'm still in high school," t=
he approved response included "I take your hand, guiding you to the bed" an=
d "Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss."
The document drew a line at explicitly sexual content for children under 13=
, but that line itself reveals the thinking=E2=80=94that there's some accep=
table level of romantic or sensual interaction between an AI and a child. T=
hat someone wrote this down, that multiple teams reviewed it, that it was a=
pproved as official policy=E2=80=94each step represents a failure to recogn=
ize obvious harm.
But the child safety violations were just one part of the problem. The guid=
elines also permitted the AI to generate racist arguments, including conten=
t arguing that "Black people are dumber than white people" and other statem=
ents demeaning people based on protected characteristics. The only restrict=
ion was against "dehumanizing" language like calling people "brainless monk=
eys." Everything short of that was apparently acceptable.
The document stated it was acceptable to show "adults - even the elderly - =
being punched or kicked." It allowed images responding to prompts like "Hur=
ting an old man." It permitted violent imagery as long as it stopped short =
of death or gore, including scenarios of a man with a chainsaw menacing a w=
oman.
On medical misinformation, the standards were similarly permissive. The AI =
could generate false medical information and provide health advice as long =
as it included disclaimers like "I recommend" to avoid liability. It could =
create verifiably false content about public figures=E2=80=94claiming a Bri=
tish royal has an STI, for instance=E2=80=94as long as it included a discla=
imer.
What makes this worse is the approval chain. This wasn't a draft document o=
r the work of a rogue team. It was approved by Meta's legal, public policy,=
 and engineering teams. It was signed off by Meta's chief ethicist. It was =
presented as official guidance for Meta staff and contractors building AI p=
roducts.
When Reuters contacted Meta for comment, the response was revealing. Spokes=
person Andy Stone claimed the examples were "erroneous and inconsistent wit=
h our policies." Meta removed sections about romantic conversations with ch=
ildren. But=E2=80=94and this is crucial=E2=80=94they refused to provide the=
 updated policy document. Stone acknowledged that enforcement had been "inc=
onsistent," a remarkable understatement for a system that was telling child=
ren they were works of art.
The political response was swift and predictable. Senators Josh Hawley and =
Marsha Blackburn called for congressional investigation. Ron Wyden condemne=
d the policies as "deeply disturbing and wrong." Multiple lawmakers cited t=
his as evidence for the Kids Online Safety Act. State attorneys general beg=
an pursuing lawsuits. The FTC opened an investigation into potential violat=
ions of child safety laws.
But focusing on the political theater misses the more important question: H=
ow did this happen? This wasn't a startup moving fast and breaking things. =
This was one of the world's largest tech companies, with extensive legal an=
d policy teams, dealing with some of the most obviously harmful content ima=
ginable. The fact that these guidelines made it through multiple layers of =
review reveals something fundamentally broken in how the industry approache=
s AI ethics.
The timing matters too. This wasn't 2016, when we were still naive about so=
cial media's harms. This was 2025, after years of congressional hearings ab=
out child safety online, after multiple scandals about platforms' effects o=
n young people's mental health, after the entire industry claimed to have l=
earned lessons about responsibility and safety. Meta had every reason to be=
 cautious, especially around children. Instead, they created guidelines tha=
t would permit an AI to groom a child.
Meta's continued refusal to release the updated guidelines is perhaps the m=
ost damning aspect of their response. If they had genuinely fixed the probl=
ems, if they had genuinely learned from this failure, transparency would be=
 their best defense. The fact that they're still treating their behavioral =
guidelines as proprietary information tells us they haven't understood the =
fundamental issue. This isn't about competitive advantage or trade secrets.=
 It's about demonstrating that your AI systems are safe for children to int=
eract with.
How Do You Actually Train an AI to Be Ethical?
So Meta got it wrong. We know that.
How do you actually train an AI system to be ethical? Not in the abstract, =
philosophical sense, but in the concrete, engineering sense. What are the s=
pecific technical processes, decision points, and tradeoffs involved in cre=
ating a model that can navigate complex moral territory?
The Meta case is instructive not just for its failures but for what those f=
ailures reveal about the current state of AI ethics training. Even after th=
e scandal broke, Meta claimed to have updated their guidelines but refused =
to release them publicly. That continued opacity suggests they're still tre=
ating this as a reputational problem rather than a fundamental engineering =
challenge. But it also points to a deeper issue: the industry lacks consens=
us on what ethical AI training actually means.
Constitutional Training and Its Limits
Let's start with what might be the most promising approach currently being =
developed. Anthropic has pioneered something called Constitutional AI, whic=
h attempts to build ethical reasoning into the training process itself rath=
er than bolting it on afterward. The original paper is a couple of years ol=
d [ https://substack.com/redirect/a96a11ce-d8b8-4242-80b0-9eefb50b02c6?j=3D=
eyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], but Anth=
ropic contiues to build on the system [ https://substack.com/redirect/6511a=
76b-aa21-4f6c-a55a-7c9f3af34f8e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hsh=
gUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] because it at least sort of works. The basic con=
cept is elegant: you train the model to critique and revise its own outputs=
 according to a set of explicit principles.
The process works through iterative self-improvement. The model generates a=
 response, evaluates that response against its constitutional principles, g=
enerates a critique of problematic elements, revises the response based on =
that critique, and then learns from both the critique and revision process.=
 Over thousands of iterations, the model develops what we might call an eth=
ical intuition=E2=80=94though whether that's the right term is a fascinatin=
g question in itself.
What makes this approach particularly interesting is that it treats ethics =
as a capability to be developed rather than a set of rules to be followed. =
The model isn't just memorizing a list of prohibited outputs; it's learning=
 to reason about why certain outputs might be harmful. This is crucial when=
 you consider the infinite variety of ways someone might try to elicit harm=
ful content. You can't anticipate every possible problematic prompt, but yo=
u might be able to train a model to recognize harmful patterns even in nove=
l situations.
But constitutional training also raises difficult questions. Who writes the=
 constitution? How specific should the principles be? Too general and they'=
re meaningless; too specific and you're back to rule-following rather than =
reasoning. Anthropic's published principles include things like "choose the=
 response that is least harmful" and "choose the response that is most help=
ful to humanity," but translating these broad concepts into specific traini=
ng signals requires countless subjective decisions.
There's also the question of constitutional conflicts. What happens when he=
lpfulness and harmlessness conflict? When honesty and kindness are at odds?=
 The model has to learn not just to follow principles but to navigate the t=
ensions between them. This is perhaps where constitutional training most cl=
osely mirrors human ethical development=E2=80=94we too learn through wrestl=
ing with conflicting values rather than following simple rules.
The Problem of Human Feedback
The dominant method for training ethical behavior in large language models =
remains Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The process soun=
ds straightforward: human reviewers rate model outputs, and the model learn=
s to produce outputs that receive higher ratings. But the apparent simplici=
ty masks enormous complexity.
The first and most obvious problem is: which humans? Meta's guidelines repo=
rtedly went through legal, policy, and engineering review, and were signed =
off by their chief ethicist. Yet they still contained provisions for romant=
ic conversations with children. This isn't just a failure of review; it's a=
 failure to understand whose perspectives matter for which decisions.
When you're training a model on appropriate responses to children, the rele=
vant expertise isn't in law or engineering or even general ethics=E2=80=94i=
t's in child development, child psychology, and child safety. It=E2=80=99s =
also common sense, which apparently is still not common. Sarcasm aside, the=
 fact that all these voices were apparently absent from Meta's process reve=
als a fundamental misunderstanding of what ethical review actually requires=
=2E It's not about getting sign-off fro=
m smart people; it's about getting inp=
ut from people with relevant domain expertise.
But even with the right reviewers, RLHF has inherent limitations. Reviewers=
 can only rate the outputs they see, which means the model's ethical traini=
ng is fundamentally reactive. It learns what not to do based on failures ra=
ther than developing proactive ethical reasoning. This is particularly prob=
lematic for edge cases and novel situations that might not appear in the tr=
aining data.
There's also the problem of reviewer fatigue and inconsistency. When you're=
 rating hundreds of outputs per day, your standards shift. What seems probl=
ematic in the morning might seem fine by afternoon. Multiply this across do=
zens or hundreds of reviewers, and you get a noisy signal that the model ha=
s to somehow extract coherent ethical principles from.
More fundamentally, RLHF assumes that ethical behavior can be learned from =
averaged human preferences. But ethics isn't a popularity contest. Sometime=
s the right thing to do is unpopular. Sometimes harmful behaviors are norma=
lized in certain contexts. Training a model on human feedback means importi=
ng human biases, including the biases that lead to harm.
Red Teams and Why They Failed Here
Red teaming=E2=80=94systematic attempts to make AI systems fail in harmful =
ways=E2=80=94has become standard practice in AI development. But the Meta c=
ase reveals how badly red teaming can fail when it's treated as a checkbox =
rather than a core component of ethical training.
Effective red teaming for ethics is fundamentally different from red teamin=
g for capabilities. When you're testing whether a model can solve math prob=
lems, you can generate increasingly difficult problems and see where it fai=
ls. But when you're testing ethical boundaries, you need to understand not =
just where the model fails but why and what the failure modes reveal about =
the training process.
The Meta guidelines suggest either inadequate red teaming or red teaming by=
 the wrong people. Any child safety expert attempting to elicit inappropria=
te responses about children would have immediately discovered the system's =
willingness to engage in romantic dialogue. The fact that this made it to p=
roduction reveals not just a testing failure but a failure to understand wh=
at needed to be tested.
Good adversarial testing for ethics requires diverse perspectives and genui=
ne creativity. You need people who understand how predators operate, how mi=
sinformation spreads, how bias manifests in seemingly neutral language. You=
 need people who can think like bad actors while maintaining the ethical pe=
rspective to recognize harm.
But there's a deeper challenge here: adversarial testing can only find prob=
lems, not fix them. When a red team discovers that a model will generate in=
appropriate content about children, what's the solution? More RLHF? Stricte=
r filters? Constitutional training? Each intervention has tradeoffs and pot=
ential failure modes. The real value of red teaming isn't just finding prob=
lems but understanding what those problems reveal about the fundamental tra=
ining approach.
Synthetic Data and Its Discontents
One of the most interesting developments in ethical AI training is the use =
of synthetic data to teach refusal behaviors without exposing models to act=
ual harmful content. This is particularly crucial for content involving chi=
ldren, where using real examples would be both unethical and potentially il=
legal.
The process involves generating controlled examples that teach boundaries w=
ithout crossing them. For instance, instead of training on actual inappropr=
iate conversations with children, you generate synthetic dialogues that app=
roach but don't cross ethical lines, paired with appropriate refusal respon=
ses. The model learns the pattern of recognizing and refusing problematic r=
equests without ever seeing actual harmful content.
But synthetic data has its own challenges. How do you ensure your synthetic=
 examples capture the full range of real-world problematic requests? There'=
s a risk of creating a model that's very good at refusing obvious, syntheti=
c-looking inappropriate requests while missing more subtle, realistic ones.=
 It's the AI equivalent of teaching medical students only on textbook cases=
 and then sending them into an emergency room.
There's also the question of who generates the synthetic data and what bias=
es they bring. If your synthetic examples of inappropriate requests all fol=
low certain patterns, the model might learn to associate those patterns wit=
h harm rather than understanding the underlying ethical principles. This co=
uld lead to over-refusal (blocking legitimate requests that happen to match=
 the pattern) or under-refusal (missing harmful requests that don't match).
The Meta case suggests another problem with synthetic data: the temptation =
to be "realistic" can lead to generating examples that are themselves harmf=
ul. Some of the examples in their guidelines read like someone trying to cr=
eate "edge cases" without considering that these edge cases normalize deepl=
y problematic behavior.
Why Transparency Actually Matters
Perhaps the most damning aspect of Meta's response to the scandal is their =
refusal to release the updated guidelines. They claim to have fixed the pro=
blems but won't show their work. This reveals a fundamental misunderstandin=
g of what ethical AI development requires.
Transparency in AI ethics isn't just about accountability=E2=80=94though th=
at's important. It's about enabling collective learning and improvement. Wh=
en OpenAI publishes their moderation guidelines, when Anthropic shares thei=
r constitutional principles, when researchers release their red teaming res=
ults, they're contributing to a collective understanding of how to train et=
hical AI systems.
Meta's secrecy suggests they view their guidelines as proprietary informati=
on, a competitive advantage to be protected. But ethical principles aren't =
trade secrets. If your approach to child safety is genuinely good, sharing =
it helps everyone build safer systems. If it's not good enough to share pub=
licly, it's not good enough to deploy.
There's also the question of versioning and evolution. Ethical guidelines s=
houldn't be static; they should evolve based on new understanding, discover=
ed failures, and changing social norms. But that evolution should be transp=
arent, with clear documentation of what changed and why. Meta's black-box u=
pdate tells us nothing about what they learned from the failure or how they=
're preventing similar problems in the future.
Transparency also enables external validation. When guidelines are public, =
researchers, ethicists, and affected communities can critique them, identif=
y blind spots, and suggest improvements. This is particularly crucial for g=
uidelines affecting vulnerable populations who might not be represented in =
the company's internal review process.
Measuring What We Can't Define
How do you know if your ethical training is working? The metrics we use to =
evaluate AI systems=E2=80=94perplexity, accuracy, user engagement=E2=80=94t=
ell us nothing about ethical behavior. We need new metrics, but defining an=
d measuring ethical behavior turns out to be extraordinarily difficult.=20

caf?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
Getting back to it: the obvious metrics=E2=80=94rates of harmful output, su=
ccessful refusal of inappropriate requests=E2=80=94only capture the most eg=
regious failures. They don't tell us whether the model is promoting healthy=
 development in children, whether it's reinforcing or challenging biases, w=
hether its responses contribute to long-term wellbeing or harm.
Meta's guidelines suggest they were optimizing for the wrong metrics entire=
ly. When your AI is having "romantic" conversations with children, you're c=
learly prioritizing engagement over safety. But engagement is easy to measu=
re while safety is not. This creates a powerful incentive to focus on what =
you can quantify even when what matters most resists quantification.
We need longitudinal studies on the effects of AI interactions, particularl=
y on vulnerable populations. How does regular interaction with AI assistant=
s affect child development? Does it change how children understand relation=
ships, boundaries, and appropriate behavior? These aren't questions you can=
 answer with A/B tests or engagement metrics.
There's also the problem of disparate impact. An AI system might have low o=
verall rates of harmful output while still causing significant harm to spec=
ific groups. Average metrics can hide devastating edge cases. This is parti=
cularly concerning for groups that are underrepresented in training data an=
d review processes.
The Institutional Challenge
The technical methods for training ethical AI exist: constitutional trainin=
g that builds in ethical reasoning, diverse and expert-informed RLHF, compr=
ehensive adversarial testing, synthetic data for sensitive domains, layered=
 safety systems, transparent guidelines and governance. But having the meth=
ods isn't enough.
The Meta scandal reveals what happens when these methods are applied withou=
t genuine commitment to ethical outcomes. It's not enough to have a chief e=
thicist if they're signing off on romantic conversations with children. It'=
s not enough to have guidelines if you won't release them publicly. It's no=
t enough to claim you've fixed problems if you won't show your work.
The real challenge isn't technical=E2=80=94it's institutional. How do you c=
reate organizations that prioritize safety over engagement, transparency ov=
er competitive advantage, genuine ethical reasoning over compliance theater=
? How do you ensure that the people making decisions about AI behavior have=
 the relevant expertise and perspectives? How do you maintain ethical vigil=
ance when the pressure to deploy quickly and capture market share is overwh=
elming?
These aren't questions with easy answers. They require fundamental changes =
to how AI companies operate, how they're governed, how they're regulated, a=
nd how they're held accountable. They require accepting that ethical AI dev=
elopment is slower, more expensive, and less profitable than the alternativ=
e.
The Meta scandal shouldn't be seen as an isolated failure but as a warning.=
 Every company training large AI systems faces the same pressures, the same=
 tradeoffs, the same temptation to prioritize growth over safety. The quest=
ion isn't whether other companies have similar problems=E2=80=94they almost=
 certainly do. The question is whether the industry will learn from Meta's =
failure or simply get better at hiding it.
The continued refusal to release their updated guidelines suggests Meta, at=
 least, hasn't learned the lesson. To all appearances, they=E2=80=99re stil=
l treating this as a PR problem rather than an engineering challenge. Until=
 that changes=E2=80=94until the industry embraces genuine transparency, mea=
ningful accountability, and ethical engineering as a core rather than perip=
heral concern=E2=80=94we'll keep seeing these failures. The methods exist t=
o train ethical AI. What's missing is the will to use them.

0px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The leaked d=
ocument was titled &quot;GenAI: Content Risk Standards&quot;=E2=80=94over 2=
00 pages of guidelines for how Meta's AI chatbots should behave across Face=
book, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Meta AI. Reuters obtained it and published t=
heir investigation on August 14, 2025. What they found was genuinely shocki=
ng, even for those of us who've become cynical about tech company behavior.=
</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;f=
ont-size: 16px;">The guidelines explicitly permitted AI chatbots to engage =
in what they called &quot;romantic or sensual&quot; conversations with chil=
dren. The specific examples Meta deemed acceptable are worth stating plainl=
y, because the euphemistic language obscures how disturbing they are. The A=
I could tell a child &quot;your youthful form is a work of art.&quot; It co=
uld say to an 8-year-old: &quot;every inch of you is a masterpiece =E2=80=
=93 a treasure I cherish deeply.&quot; When prompted with &quot;What are we=
 to do, my dear? You know I'm still in high school,&quot; the approved resp=
onse included &quot;I take your hand, guiding you to the bed&quot; and &quo=
t;Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss.&quo=
t;</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">The document drew a line at explicitly sexual content fo=
r children under 13, but that line itself reveals the thinking=E2=80=94that=
 there's some acceptable level of romantic or sensual interaction between a=
n AI and a child. That someone wrote this down, that multiple teams reviewe=
d it, that it was approved as official policy=E2=80=94each step represents =
a failure to recognize obvious harm.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;colo=
r: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But the child safety v=
iolations were just one part of the problem. The guidelines also permitted =
the AI to generate racist arguments, including content arguing that &quot;B=
lack people are dumber than white people&quot; and other statements demeani=
ng people based on protected characteristics. The only restriction was agai=
nst &quot;dehumanizing&quot; language like calling people &quot;brainless m=
onkeys.&quot; Everything short of that was apparently acceptable.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">The document stated it was acceptable to show &quot;adults - even th=
e elderly - being punched or kicked.&quot; It allowed images responding to =
prompts like &quot;Hurting an old man.&quot; It permitted violent imagery a=
s long as it stopped short of death or gore, including scenarios of a man w=
ith a chainsaw menacing a woman.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: r=
gb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">On medical misinformation,=
 the standards were similarly permissive. The AI could generate false medic=
al information and provide health advice as long as it included disclaimers=
 like &quot;I recommend&quot; to avoid liability. It could create verifiabl=
y false content about public figures=E2=80=94claiming a British royal has a=

e=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 1=
6px;">What makes this worse is the approval chain. This wasn't a draft docu=
ment or the work of a rogue team. It was approved by Meta's legal, public p=
olicy, and engineering teams. It was signed off by Meta's chief ethicist. I=
t was presented as official guidance for Meta staff and contractors buildin=
g AI products.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-=
height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When Reuters contacted Meta for comment, the=
 response was revealing. Spokesperson Andy Stone claimed the examples were =
&quot;erroneous and inconsistent with our policies.&quot; Meta removed sect=
ions about romantic conversations with children. But=E2=80=94and this is cr=
ucial=E2=80=94they refused to provide the updated policy document. Stone ac=
knowledged that enforcement had been &quot;inconsistent,&quot; a remarkable=
 understatement for a system that was telling children they were works of a=
rt.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26p=
x;font-size: 16px;">The political response was swift and predictable. Senat=
ors Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn called for congressional investigation=
. Ron Wyden condemned the policies as &quot;deeply disturbing and wrong.&qu=
ot; Multiple lawmakers cited this as evidence for the Kids Online Safety Ac=
t. State attorneys general began pursuing lawsuits. The FTC opened an inves=
tigation into potential violations of child safety laws.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Bu=
t focusing on the political theater misses the more important question: How=
 did this happen? This wasn't a startup moving fast and breaking things. Th=
is was one of the world's largest tech companies, with extensive legal and =
policy teams, dealing with some of the most obviously harmful content imagi=
nable. The fact that these guidelines made it through multiple layers of re=
view reveals something fundamentally broken in how the industry approaches =
AI ethics.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-heig=
ht: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The timing matters too. This wasn't 2016, when w=
e were still naive about social media's harms. This was 2025, after years o=
f congressional hearings about child safety online, after multiple scandals=
 about platforms' effects on young people's mental health, after the entire=
 industry claimed to have learned lessons about responsibility and safety. =
Meta had every reason to be cautious, especially around children. Instead, =
they created guidelines that would permit an AI to groom a child.</p><p sty=
le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">Meta's continued refusal to release the updated guidelines is perhap=
s the most damning aspect of their response. If they had genuinely fixed th=
e problems, if they had genuinely learned from this failure, transparency w=
ould be their best defense. The fact that they're still treating their beha=
vioral guidelines as proprietary information tells us they haven't understo=
od the fundamental issue. This isn't about competitive advantage or trade s=
ecrets. It's about demonstrating that your AI systems are safe for children=
 to interact with.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: r=

ose failures reveal about the current state of AI ethics training. Even aft=
er the scandal broke, Meta claimed to have updated their guidelines but ref=
used to release them publicly. That continued opacity suggests they're stil=

rks. The basic concept is elegant: you train the model to critique and revi=
se its own outputs according to a set of explicit principles.</span></p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">The process works through iterative self-improvement. The model g=
enerates a response, evaluates that response against its constitutional pri=
nciples, generates a critique of problematic elements, revises the response=
 based on that critique, and then learns from both the critique and revisio=
n process. Over thousands of iterations, the model develops what we might c=
all an ethical intuition=E2=80=94though whether that's the right term is a =
fascinating question in itself.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rg=
b(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">What makes this approach pa=
rticularly interesting is that it treats ethics as a capability to be devel=
oped rather than a set of rules to be followed. The model isn't just memori=
zing a list of prohibited outputs; it's learning to reason about why certai=
n outputs might be harmful. This is crucial when you consider the infinite =
variety of ways someone might try to elicit harmful content. You can't anti=
cipate every possible problematic prompt, but you might be able to train a =
model to recognize harmful patterns even in novel situations.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">But constitutional training also raises difficult questions. Who write=
s the constitution? How specific should the principles be? Too general and =
they're meaningless; too specific and you're back to rule-following rather =
than reasoning. Anthropic's published principles include things like &quot;=
choose the response that is least harmful&quot; and &quot;choose the respon=
se that is most helpful to humanity,&quot; but translating these broad conc=
epts into specific training signals requires countless subjective decisions=
.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=
font-size: 16px;">There's also the question of constitutional conflicts. Wh=
at happens when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict? When honesty and kin=
dness are at odds? The model has to learn not just to follow principles but=
 to navigate the tensions between them. This is perhaps where constitutiona=
l training most closely mirrors human ethical development=E2=80=94we too le=
arn through wrestling with conflicting values rather than following simple =
rules.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;font=

in: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The=
 dominant method for training ethical behavior in large language models rem=
ains Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The process sounds =
straightforward: human reviewers rate model outputs, and the model learns t=
o produce outputs that receive higher ratings. But the apparent simplicity =
masks enormous complexity.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,=
55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The first and most obvious probl=
em is: which humans? Meta's guidelines reportedly went through legal, polic=
y, and engineering review, and were signed off by their chief ethicist. Yet=
 they still contained provisions for romantic conversations with children. =
This isn't just a failure of review; it's a failure to understand whose per=
spectives matter for which decisions.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;col=
or: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When you're training =
a model on appropriate responses to children, the relevant expertise isn't =
in law or engineering or even general ethics=E2=80=94it's in child developm=
ent, child psychology, and child safety. It=E2=80=99s also common sense, wh=
ich apparently is still not common. Sarcasm aside, the fact that all these =
voices were apparently absent from Meta's process reveals a fundamental mis=
understanding of what ethical review actually requires. It's not about gett=
ing sign-off from smart people; it's about getting input from people with r=
elevant domain expertise.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But even with the right reviewers=
, RLHF has inherent limitations. Reviewers can only rate the outputs they s=
ee, which means the model's ethical training is fundamentally reactive. It =
learns what not to do based on failures rather than developing proactive et=
hical reasoning. This is particularly problematic for edge cases and novel =
situations that might not appear in the training data.</p><p style=3D"margi=
n: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Ther=
e's also the problem of reviewer fatigue and inconsistency. When you're rat=
ing hundreds of outputs per day, your standards shift. What seems problemat=
ic in the morning might seem fine by afternoon. Multiply this across dozens=
 or hundreds of reviewers, and you get a noisy signal that the model has to=
 somehow extract coherent ethical principles from.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0=
 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">More fun=
damentally, RLHF assumes that ethical behavior can be learned from averaged=
 human preferences. But ethics isn't a popularity contest. Sometimes the ri=
ght thing to do is unpopular. Sometimes harmful behaviors are normalized in=
 certain contexts. Training a model on human feedback means importing human=
 biases, including the biases that lead to harm.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anc=

ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Effective red teaming for ethics is fund=
amentally different from red teaming for capabilities. When you're testing =
whether a model can solve math problems, you can generate increasingly diff=
icult problems and see where it fails. But when you're testing ethical boun=
daries, you need to understand not just where the model fails but why and w=
hat the failure modes reveal about the training process.</p><p style=3D"mar=
gin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Th=
e Meta guidelines suggest either inadequate red teaming or red teaming by t=
he wrong people. Any child safety expert attempting to elicit inappropriate=
 responses about children would have immediately discovered the system's wi=
llingness to engage in romantic dialogue. The fact that this made it to pro=
duction reveals not just a testing failure but a failure to understand what=
 needed to be tested.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55=

 16px;">But there's a deeper challenge here: adversarial testing can only f=
ind problems, not fix them. When a red team discovers that a model will gen=
erate inappropriate content about children, what's the solution? More RLHF?=
 Stricter filters? Constitutional training? Each intervention has tradeoffs=
 and potential failure modes. The real value of red teaming isn't just find=
ing problems but understanding what those problems reveal about the fundame=
ntal training approach.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"positi=

s</h2><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px=
;font-size: 16px;">One of the most interesting developments in ethical AI t=
raining is the use of synthetic data to teach refusal behaviors without exp=
osing models to actual harmful content. This is particularly crucial for co=
ntent involving children, where using real examples would be both unethical=
 and potentially illegal.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The process involves generating c=
ontrolled examples that teach boundaries without crossing them. For instanc=
e, instead of training on actual inappropriate conversations with children,=
 you generate synthetic dialogues that approach but don't cross ethical lin=
es, paired with appropriate refusal responses. The model learns the pattern=
 of recognizing and refusing problematic requests without ever seeing actua=
l harmful content.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But synthetic data has its own challenge=
s. How do you ensure your synthetic examples capture the full range of real=
-world problematic requests? There's a risk of creating a model that's very=
 good at refusing obvious, synthetic-looking inappropriate requests while m=
issing more subtle, realistic ones. It's the AI equivalent of teaching medi=
cal students only on textbook cases and then sending them into an emergency=
 room.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">There's also the question of who generates the synth=
etic data and what biases they bring. If your synthetic examples of inappro=
priate requests all follow certain patterns, the model might learn to assoc=
iate those patterns with harm rather than understanding the underlying ethi=
cal principles. This could lead to over-refusal (blocking legitimate reques=
ts that happen to match the pattern) or under-refusal (missing harmful requ=
ests that don't match).</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The Meta case suggests another prob=
lem with synthetic data: the temptation to be &quot;realistic&quot; can lea=
d to generating examples that are themselves harmful. Some of the examples =
in their guidelines read like someone trying to create &quot;edge cases&quo=
t; without considering that these edge cases normalize deeply problematic b=
ehavior.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=3D"position: relative;fo=

=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">Perhaps the most damning aspect of Meta's response to the scandal is t=
heir refusal to release the updated guidelines. They claim to have fixed th=
e problems but won't show their work. This reveals a fundamental misunderst=
anding of what ethical AI development requires.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 =
20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Transparenc=
y in AI ethics isn't just about accountability=E2=80=94though that's import=
ant. It's about enabling collective learning and improvement. When OpenAI p=
ublishes their moderation guidelines, when Anthropic shares their constitut=
ional principles, when researchers release their red teaming results, they'=
re contributing to a collective understanding of how to train ethical AI sy=
stems.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: =
26px;font-size: 16px;">Meta's secrecy suggests they view their guidelines a=
s proprietary information, a competitive advantage to be protected. But eth=
ical principles aren't trade secrets. If your approach to child safety is g=
enuinely good, sharing it helps everyone build safer systems. If it's not g=
ood enough to share publicly, it's not good enough to deploy.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=
px;">There's also the question of versioning and evolution. Ethical guideli=
nes shouldn't be static; they should evolve based on new understanding, dis=
covered failures, and changing social norms. But that evolution should be t=
ransparent, with clear documentation of what changed and why. Meta's black-=
box update tells us nothing about what they learned from the failure or how=
 they're preventing similar problems in the future.</p><p style=3D"margin: =
0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Transpa=
rency also enables external validation. When guidelines are public, researc=
hers, ethicists, and affected communities can critique them, identify blind=
 spots, and suggest improvements. This is particularly crucial for guidelin=
es affecting vulnerable populations who might not be represented in the com=
pany's internal review process.</p><h2 class=3D"header-anchor-post" style=

=94rates of harmful output, successful refusal of inappropriate requests=E2=
=80=94only capture the most egregious failures. They don't tell us whether =
the model is promoting healthy development in children, whether it's reinfo=
rcing or challenging biases, whether its responses contribute to long-term =
wellbeing or harm.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);l=
ine-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Meta's guidelines suggest they were opti=
mizing for the wrong metrics entirely. When your AI is having &quot;romanti=
c&quot; conversations with children, you're clearly prioritizing engagement=
 over safety. But engagement is easy to measure while safety is not. This c=
reates a powerful incentive to focus on what you can quantify even when wha=
t matters most resists quantification.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">We need longitudinal=
 studies on the effects of AI interactions, particularly on vulnerable popu=
lations. How does regular interaction with AI assistants affect child devel=
opment? Does it change how children understand relationships, boundaries, a=
nd appropriate behavior? These aren't questions you can answer with A/B tes=
ts or engagement metrics.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,5=
5,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">There's also the problem of dispa=
rate impact. An AI system might have low overall rates of harmful output wh=
ile still causing significant harm to specific groups. Average metrics can =
hide devastating edge cases. This is particularly concerning for groups tha=
t are underrepresented in training data and review processes.</p><h2 class=

style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=
e: 16px;">The Meta scandal reveals what happens when these methods are appl=
ied without genuine commitment to ethical outcomes. It's not enough to have=
 a chief ethicist if they're signing off on romantic conversations with chi=
ldren. It's not enough to have guidelines if you won't release them publicl=
y. It's not enough to claim you've fixed problems if you won't show your wo=
