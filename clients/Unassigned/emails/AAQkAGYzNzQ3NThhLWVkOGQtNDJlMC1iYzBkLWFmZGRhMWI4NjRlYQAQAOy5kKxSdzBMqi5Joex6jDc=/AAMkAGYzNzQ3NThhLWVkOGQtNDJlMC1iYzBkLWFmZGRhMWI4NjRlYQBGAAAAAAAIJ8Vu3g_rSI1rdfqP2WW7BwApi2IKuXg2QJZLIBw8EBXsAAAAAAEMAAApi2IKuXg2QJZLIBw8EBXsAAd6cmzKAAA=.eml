If you=E2=80=99re launching a new product or company, the name you choose m=
ay be the single most important decision you make. A great name creates a f=
oundation of trust with consumers, gives meaning and voice to a new idea, a=
nd builds cumulative advantage over time. Names that are too descriptive an=
d too comfortable won=E2=80=99t generate the interest or memorability that =
a new brand needs to succeed.
In my more than 40 years leading Lexicon Branding, we=E2=80=99ve created na=
mes like Swiffer, Sonos, BlackBerry, Azure, Impossible Foods, Vercel, Winds=
urf, and many more. In that time, I=E2=80=99ve seen too many teams treat na=
ming as a low priority with marginal results. It=E2=80=99s one of the highe=
st-stakes parts of building a brand, yet it=E2=80=99s too often delegated t=
o junior staff or tackled in group brainstorming sessions.
The difference between a good-enough name and the right name is the differe=
nce between solid performance and breakthrough success. The right name is a=
 competitive advantage that no one can take away from you.
Nobody knew Codeium until it became Windsurf.
People didn=E2=80=99t care about computer processors until Intel introduced=
 Pentium.
No one loved mopping until Procter & Gamble created the Swiffer.
Nobody wanted to eat a Maraxi. But an Impossible Burger? Even meat lovers f=
locked to it.
Why names must work harder than ever
AI and technologies like VR are reshaping how people discover, evaluate, an=
d experience brands. We=E2=80=99ll see more innovation and new brands in th=
e next five years than in the previous 20. This creates six key challenges:
Unprecedented competition: More players, more noise, more choice.
Trademark clutter: Congestion across all 45 trademark classes. In the U.S.,=
 there are over 5,500,000 registered trademarks.
Attention scarcity: Audiences are distracted and overwhelmed.
Global digital commerce: Names must work across languages, cultures, and pl=
atforms simultaneously.
Institutional skepticism: People have learned not to believe hype.
Information overload: A signal must be stronger to stand out.
For startups, the challenge is even greater. Your name must attract both in=
vestors and early adopters.
The three pillars of effective naming
To address these challenges, focusing on three dimensions will increase you=
r likelihood of creating a truly effective name. While we have been using t=
hese three pillars for many years at Lexicon, the first pillar, =E2=80=9CBu=
ild for trust,=E2=80=9D has increased in importance. The marketplace is mov=
ing so fast now that a new brand must gain momentum early or it will fail. =
Trust is a key factor in momentum.
1. Build for trust.
The right name inspires both trust and imagination. Consider Microsoft=E2=
=80=99s Azure cloud services brand. The team at Microsoft considered callin=
g it =E2=80=9CMicrosoft Cloud Services,=E2=80=9D but there=E2=80=99s no new=
s in such a straightforward name. When we presented this name, one senior M=
icrosoft executive called it =E2=80=9Ca dumb idea.=E2=80=9D Turns out, it w=
asn=E2=80=99t so dumb after all. It offered familiarity as a word while gen=
erating significant interest based on customer interviews. The sounds in Az=
ure provide additional benefits: the =E2=80=9Cz=E2=80=9D sound creates a st=
rong signal, while the =E2=80=9Czure=E2=80=9D (like =E2=80=9Csure=E2=80=9D)=
 creates a smooth experience.
2. Communicate an original idea. Never describe.
Anyone can describe what a company does. For example, Infoseek is descripti=
ve and one-dimensional. A name like that is boring and likely to have a tho=
usand similar names swirling around in the competitive landscape. On the ot=
her hand, Google=E2=80=94an invented, surprising word=E2=80=94signals a new=
 idea. In our research, we know we have a winner when customers tell us, =
=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re not like the other guys.=E2=80=9D TripActions is a=
nother example of a very descriptive name. As the company grew and develope=
d an expense platform as well, TripActions no longer worked even descriptiv=
ely. We created Navan, a palindrome that links to travel (=E2=80=9Cnavigati=
on=E2=80=9D) but offers the originality that the company wanted to help the=
m move into financial services=E2=80=94and the flexibility to grow into new=
 industries. Since the rebrand in 2023, Navan revenues have grown from $150=
 million to over $500 million in 2025.
3. Be accessible.
The human brain doesn=E2=80=99t like complexity=E2=80=94or remember it very=
 well. Make sure your name is easy to process and contains familiar compone=
nts. We used the simple and familiar geographic term =E2=80=9COutback=E2=80=
=9D to create Subaru=E2=80=99s most successful brand to date.
Case study: Intel=E2=80=99s Pentium
The story of Intel=E2=80=99s Pentium is a perfect example of how to structu=
re a naming process to get an effective result.
Intel needed to differentiate its next-generation processor. Up to that poi=
nt, chip manufacturers only used model numbers. While Intel=E2=80=99s 486 p=
rocessor outperformed AMD=E2=80=99s 486, consumers perceived the two as ide=
ntical. Can you blame them?
Our first criterion was to develop a name that would differentiate Intel=E2=
=80=99s processor from all others. Based on interviews with Intel executive=
s, we agreed that the new name needed to capitalize on the success of the =
=E2=80=9CIntel Inside=E2=80=9D campaign. =E2=80=9CProchip=E2=80=9D was an i=
nternal favorite at the time. But our research gave us clear creative direc=
tion: develop a name that sounds and looks like an element inside the compu=
ter that is fundamental to performance. =E2=80=9CPentium=E2=80=9D looked an=
d sounded like familiar, science-based words such as =E2=80=9Csodium=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Curanium,=E2=80=9D using the =E2=80=9C-ium=E2=80=9D suffix =
for fluency. But while it was a familiar-seeming word, it was unexpected fo=
r the category=E2=80=94a strategic advantage that made it stick out and sti=
ck in people=E2=80=99s memory.
Here=E2=80=99s a key insight: Invented names like Pentium actually take les=
s money to build into brands than existing words=E2=80=94despite a common m=
yth to the contrary. Invented names signal =E2=80=9Cnew and innovative=E2=
=80=9D better than most other name types. Further, because they are unexpec=
ted rather than descriptive or suggestive names, they generate more attenti=
on. Humans are more interested in the new.
Research conducted by Lexicon in six markets provided data showing that =E2=
=80=9CPentium=E2=80=9D delivered the magic Intel needed. Within months, con=
sumers were asking for Pentium computers=E2=80=94to the chagrin of Dell, HP=
, and others.
The Lexicon process: beyond brainstorming
Creating the right name requires more than one or two brainstorming session=
s. Those brainstorming sessions=E2=80=94especially with four or more partic=
ipants=E2=80=94can get bogged down by everyone=E2=80=99s need to be right, =
and the peer pressure to agree on a popular solution. As a result, they usu=
ally deliver marginal results. When we work with clients, we stick to key p=
rocess principles:
Set high standards, not narrow objectives. Aim for fresh, energetic ideas, =
not just basic objectives like =E2=80=9Csupport the product=E2=80=99s posit=
ioning=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ckeep it under seven letters.=E2=80=9D
We use a framework called the Diamond Framework to force clarity on busines=
s, marketing, and naming strategy. At the start of any project, we ask:
What does winning look like?
What do we have to win?
What do we need to win?
What do we need to say?
This creates alignment on the role of the name versus other brand elements =
like design and messaging. Here are the results of the exercise we did whil=
e working with P&G to develop the Swiffer brand name.
Quantity breeds quality. Developing a brand name is a treasure hunt. You ne=
ed to explore, and then explore again. And you need to explore in places wh=
ere you think there may be no chance of finding the name. Naming is hard wo=
rk. We recommend generating at least 1,000 creative ideas before selecting =
a shortlist of 50 to 100 candidates. (We usually generate thousands.)
Don=E2=80=99t underestimate the power of sound. Imagine the sound of your b=
rand before you start naming. Should your name sound fast? Full? Reliable? =
Coca-Cola=E2=80=99s Dasani water brand exemplifies this. An invented name w=
ith the Latin word for health (=E2=80=9Csan=E2=80=9D) in the middle, a =E2=
=80=9Cda=E2=80=9D sound that delivers a crisp, clean experience, and an =E2=
=80=9Ci=E2=80=9D sound that feels light and slim at the end.
Case study: Swiffer and the invention of a new category
P&G had invented what they called a new mop, but it wasn=E2=80=99t really a=
 mop. We started by interviewing 25 people about cleaning routines. Some en=
joyed washing windows, others polishing furniture. No one liked mopping. On=
e participant said, =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s just moving dirt and grease from =
one place to another.=E2=80=9D Another said, =E2=80=9CMopping is just not f=
un.=E2=80=9D
We reframed the problem around fun, eliminating names like =E2=80=9CPromop=
=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CEffiClean.=E2=80=9D One small team explored toys, oth=
er exotic vacations, and other easy-to-use tools. Our linguists focused on =
the actions and sounds of cleaning=E2=80=94sweeping, wiping, washing. When =
we merged the work, =E2=80=9CSwiffer=E2=80=9D sat in the middle.
The best names don=E2=80=99t describe reality; they change it. Swiffer made=
 mopping feel like a quick, joyful action. In research with our linguistic =
network and consumers, Swiffer was selected over 80% of the time as the new=
 brand they would be most interested to try.
Case study: The story of Vercel
When we started working with a company called Zeit, the team and technology=
 were impressive. Using our Diamond Framework, we defined winning as being =
the most innovative and =E2=80=9Cfastest-moving company in the category.=E2=
=80=9D Based on that, we agreed that a coined, inventive name was the right=
 direction. We built matrices of naming components, including prefixes and =
suffixes that communicated accuracy, speed, and flow; word parts that spoke=
 to the company=E2=80=99s talent and recruiting; and a set of Greek, Latin,=
 and Sanskrit words that meant reliability and power. And using our proprie=
tary sound-symbolism software, we identified fast-sounding letters.
Drawing from these components, we combined 55 prefixes and 102 suffixes and=
 got about 60 interesting ideas=E2=80=94not solutions; not yet. We repeated=
 the steps three times over two weeks. =E2=80=9CVercel=E2=80=9D rose to the=
 top with a sound that is alive and daring, six letters, familiar parts ass=
embled in a unique way.
What not to do
Here are a few things that we have learned not to do over four decades of n=
aming:...

The right name inspires both trust and imagination. Consider Microsoft=E2=

g it =E2=80=9CMicrosoft Cloud Services,=E2=80=9D but there=E2=80=99s no new=

asn=E2=80=99t so dumb after all. It offered familiarity as a word while gen=

(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">P&amp;G had invented what th=
ey called a new mop, but it wasn=E2=80=99t really a mop. We started by inte=
rviewing 25 people about cleaning routines. Some enjoyed washing windows, o=
thers polishing furniture. No one liked mopping. One participant said, =E2=
=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s just moving dirt and grease from one place to another.=
=E2=80=9D Another said, =E2=80=9CMopping is just not fun.=E2=80=9D</p><p st=

=9CPromop=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CEffiClean.=E2=80=9D One small team explored =
toys, other exotic vacations, and other easy-to-use tools. Our linguists fo=

 Based on that, we agreed that a coined, inventive name was the right direc=
tion. We built matrices of naming components, including prefixes and suffix=
es that communicated accuracy, speed, and flow; word parts that spoke to th=
e company=E2=80=99s talent and recruiting; and a set of Greek, Latin, and S=
anskrit words that meant reliability and power. And using our proprietary s=
ound-symbolism software, we identified fast-sounding letters.</p><p style=
