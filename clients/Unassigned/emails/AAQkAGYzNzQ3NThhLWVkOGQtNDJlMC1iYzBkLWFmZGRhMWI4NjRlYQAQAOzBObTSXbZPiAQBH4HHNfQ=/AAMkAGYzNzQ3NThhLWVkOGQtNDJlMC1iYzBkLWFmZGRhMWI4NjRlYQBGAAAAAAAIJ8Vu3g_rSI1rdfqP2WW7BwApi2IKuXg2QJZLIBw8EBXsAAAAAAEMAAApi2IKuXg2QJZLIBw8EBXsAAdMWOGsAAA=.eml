I got lots of feedback on my post from Sunday [ https://substack.com/redire=

LQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] about a community for paid subscribers.
TLDR y=E2=80=99all want one, and you want it to be on Discord.=20
So I made one!=20
We=E2=80=99ve got a couple of dozen brave alpha testers already in there an=
d I=E2=80=99ll throw the link in below here. Hop on in! We have channels fo=
r Substack discussion, AI news, AI questions, and I=E2=80=99m gonna get an =
AI jobs channel going here soon as well.
Also have had a fair bit of interest from founding members on my weekly CEO=
-view posts. A bit more about them:
I'm building short, sharp weekly intelligence briefs for leaders making rea=
l decisions with real money.=20
Think 3-4 pages max, packed with insights that usually cost too much from c=
onsultants=E2=80=94AI procurement pitfalls, hidden implementation costs bli=
ndsiding CFOs, liability issues, which investment patterns actually correla=
te with ROI.=20
The goal is clear, frank discussion of the issue, specific actionable paths=
 forward, and hard-headed analysis you can take to the bank.
You can change your Substack plan here [ https://substack.com/redirect/7359=
b03a-3363-45c1-b87e-e5d3ddfd49f7?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hs=
hgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] if you=E2=80=99re like to get the first one (co=
ming Sunday). Substack will prorate you for previous months etc. so if you=
=E2=80=99re been subbing for awhile you won=E2=80=99t be in at full price.=
=20
Hint: the first one is on a gnarly compliance issue with board liability im=
plications that=E2=80=99s facing just about every AI startup right now and =
that kicks in at the beginning of August. Fun times!
Besides the link underneath, I=E2=80=99m throwing a juicy tidbit for fun on=
 whatever the heck Meta is doing right now with those wild acquisition offe=
rs (Zuck my DMs are open lmao). Yes this post is pretty blunt about what Zu=
ck is doing so buckle up!
Subscribers get all the good stuff, and now a community lol
Ok, first things first, the good ol=E2=80=99 Discord community link is here=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7b67ec7-5a46-464e-a8d5-841a3d7e11c1?j=3De=
yJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. Hop in, i=
ntroduce yourself, and say hi!
Second, what is Zuck doing?! This is what AI game theory [ https://substack=
=2Ecom/redirect/aaf67d26-71a9-4c78-867=
e-468f73e95c6e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.=
zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] gets you.
But seriously, I've been watching Mark Zuckerberg transform into Silicon Va=
lley's most desperate recruiter, and it's wild. The dude is personally slid=
ing into AI researchers' WhatsApp DMs offering $100 million signing bonuses=
=2E Not his HR team. Him. This is founde=
r mode in a sort of questionable way.
And to be fair, betting against Zuck has about a zero percent success rate =
(so far), so I might be eating my hat in a few months if he can buy his way=
 back into the race. But so far, it=E2=80=99s not looking good. It=E2=80=99=
s not looking like normal CEO behavior. This is panic.
Zuck just dropped $14.3 billion on Scale AI=E2=80=94Meta's biggest external=
 investment ever. But here's the kicker: it wasn't really about the company=
=2E It was about hiring one guy, 27-yea=
r-old Alexandr Wang, to run a new "sup=
erintelligence" lab.
When you're spending $14 billion to basically acqui-hire one person, you've=
 moved beyond "aggressive recruiting" into "something is very wrong" territ=
ory.
Remember when Zuck was all about open-source AI? The whole "we'll build an =
ecosystem with Llama models and crush OpenAI" strategy?
Yeah, that died with Llama 4.
The launch was a complete disaster. Developers absolutely roasted it. Despi=
te having 402 billion parameters, it performed like (politely) kinda garbag=
e compared to smaller models. I saw Reddit threads titled "I'm incredibly d=
isappointed with Llama-4 [ https://substack.com/redirect/34733dde-0d8f-451d=
-8314-b54b5d25f3dd?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ]" getting hundreds of upvotes.
But wait, here=E2=80=99s where it gets spicy. When news broke about Zuck's =
$100M offers to OpenAI staff, Sam Altman didn't just respond=E2=80=94he wen=
t for the throat:
"None of our best people have decided to take them up on that [ https://sub=
stack.com/redirect/1f158f87-2304-46e9-9478-be0ea2d9664e?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN=
6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]."
But wait, there's more from Sam:
"I don't think they're a company that's great at innovation. I think we und=
erstand a lot of things they don't."
Lol. That's not just rejecting an offer=E2=80=94that's questioning whether =
Meta even belongs in the AI conversation.
While Zuck writes bigger checks, Meta has lost 78% of its original Llama te=
am [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7bb17fb-a1a9-4103-bb84-413d767dbece?j=
=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. That'=
s not turnover=E2=80=94that's everyone saying "nah, I'm good" and leaving.
Meanwhile, Anthropic keeps 80% of their people happy [ https://substack.com=
/redirect/82418730-924c-4dd7-8985-73ffde5b452c?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy=
88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] without nine-figure bribes. Their=
 secret? Maybe actually having a vision beyond "throw money at the problem.=
"
What This Really Means
I think we're watching the birth of a new Silicon Valley hierarchy. At the =
top: companies that actually get AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, and increasingly Go=
ogle). Below them: everyone else trying to buy their way in.
Zuck's pivot from "ecosystem builder" to "desperate talent acquirer" in jus=
t a few months tells you everything about where Meta really stands in the A=
I race. Life comes at you fast. When your strategy becomes "offer absurd mo=
ney because we can't out-innovate," you've already lost. (I think I lost my=
 10 mil from Zuck with this post huh)
The funniest part? In an industry where the best insights can't be bought, =
Zuck is learning that $100 million signing bonuses might not be enough.
Money can't buy you vision. And in AI, vision is everything. Turns out peop=
le want to be a part of something bigger than themselves (or the next Insta=
 chatbot).
Subscribers get all the good stuff
