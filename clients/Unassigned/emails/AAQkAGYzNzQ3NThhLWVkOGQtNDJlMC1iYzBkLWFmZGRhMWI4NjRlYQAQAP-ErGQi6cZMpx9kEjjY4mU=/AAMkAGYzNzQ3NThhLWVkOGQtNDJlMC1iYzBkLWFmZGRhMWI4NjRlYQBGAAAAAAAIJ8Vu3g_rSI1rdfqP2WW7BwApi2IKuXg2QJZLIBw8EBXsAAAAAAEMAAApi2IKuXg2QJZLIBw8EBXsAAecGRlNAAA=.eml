A DIVIDED UKRAINE AND EUROPEAN SECURITY [3]
A DE FACTO LINE OF CONTROL IS LIKELY TO HARDEN.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
A few months from now will mark the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which started a war that has redefined European security and exposed the limits of Russian power
projection. Though the conflict has yet to be resolved, the strategic logic of those involved suggests that it cannot continue indefinitely at its current intensity. Whenever the fighting does end, a
de facto line of control is likely to harden, leaving a divided Ukraine that endures as a Western-aligned state anchoring the new equilibrium in Eastern Europe.
A planned summit in Hungary between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was delayed on Oct. 21, reflecting a calculated pause in Washington’s engagement with Moscow amid
heightened global tension and domestic scrutiny. A senior White House official told Reuters that “there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,”
after a “productive call” between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov failed to narrow gaps on Ukraine and European security architecture. Speaking to
reporters, Trump said he did not want a “wasted meeting,” which suggests he wants diplomatic leverage and political credit at home before committing to another high-visibility encounter with
Putin. Meanwhile, Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, claimed that “preparations [for a meeting] continue,” underscoring the Kremlin’s effort to create the illusion of parity as
Washington dictates the pace of renewed dialogue.
After granting Russia considerable latitude over the past 10 months, Trump cannot afford to be seen as weak against Putin. The U.S. president's approval ratings have dipped below 50 percent,
underscoring the political cost of appearing ineffective on the international stage. With midterm elections just over a year away, the timeline for demonstrating diplomatic leverage is shortening,
making any delay potentially damaging at home and abroad. Even if a deal fails to materialize, Trump must act decisively to show that he controls the rules of the engagement and to counter the
perception that Moscow is exploiting his desire for diplomacy. Washington's move on Wednesday to sanction Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's largest oil companies, is evidence of the administration's
sensitivity to charges of weakness.
Beyond domestic politics, a deeper geopolitical logic underpins Washington’s current approach to Ukraine: Washington is fundamentally overhauling its 80-year-old geostrategy, moving from global
primacy toward a model of selective engagement and regional burden-sharing. This transition would have allies and partner nations assuming primary responsibility for security in their respective
regions, with Washington playing a supporting role. In Europe, U.S. policy rests on the premise that Russia, though capable of disruption, is no longer the threat to the U.S. that the Soviet Union
was.
[Ukraine's Strategic Position] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
Certainly, the war in Ukraine has shown that Russia falls well short of the military and industrial might that the Soviets possessed. After nearly four years of fighting, Moscow's failures underscore
the erosion of its conventional power and the limits of its mobilization capacity. Russia will need years to rebuild its economic base, replenish its arsenal and restore force readiness, diminishing
its ability to threaten Europe in the near term. In the meantime, Russia will try to gain as much territory in eastern Ukraine as possible as it waits for Washington to continue its withdrawal from
the global stage, after which it will exploit strategic opportunities in Europe as they emerge.
This strategy has a couple of problems that Moscow is all too aware of. First and more immediately, the continued rejection of Trump’s diplomatic overtures risks escalation. The U.S. could respond
by supplying additional military aid to Ukraine that could lead to real battlefield reversals. The Kremlin, for its part, recognizes how Trump’s political imperatives will influence his willingness
to act decisively. As a result, there are limits to how far Russia can delay or continue to manipulate negotiations without incurring costs.
Second, over the long term the U.S. will not simply transfer the security burden to its European allies once a peace deal is achieved. Any retrenchment will depend on the creation of robust mechanisms
to guarantee regional stability without direct U.S. intervention. In practice, the U.S. will stand down only as European partners stand up. This approach assumes that Russia poses no threat that
Europe cannot manage. If that is not the case, then the U.S. is prepared to delay or recalibrate its geostrategic realignment to safeguard European security and U.S. interests.
After all, it is not in Washington’s interest for a hostile power in Europe to gain access to the Atlantic Ocean. This has been a major historical imperative of the United States since the Monroe
Doctrine. As an oceanic and global power, Washington cannot allow threats to North America or the broader Western Hemisphere. So no matter how committed Washington is to drawing down from Europe, the
Trump administration will refrain from pulling out of the Continent in a way that leaves it vulnerable to Russia.
This is why two senior Kremlin officials – Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov – emphasized on Oct. 22 that preparations for a summit in Budapest are
imminent. Russia and the U.S. have incentives to tacitly accept the de facto partition of Ukraine as a framework for negotiations. Trump has proposed that Russian and Ukrainian forces halt fighting
along the existing battle lines to stabilize the situation. The remaining question is where the line of control will ultimately be drawn.

o reporters, Trump said he did not want a =E2=80=9Cwasted meeting,=E2=80=9D=
 which suggests he wants diplomatic leverage and political credit at home b=
efore committing to another high-visibility encounter with Putin. Meanwhile=
, Putin=E2=80=99s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, claimed that =E2=80=9C=
preparations [for a meeting] continue,=E2=80=9D underscoring the Kremlin=E2=
=80=99s effort to create the illusion of parity as Washington dictates the =
pace of renewed dialogue.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">After granting Rus=
sia considerable latitude over the past 10 months, Trump cannot afford to b=
e seen as weak against Putin. The U.S. president's approval ratings have di=
pped below 50 percent, underscoring the political cost of appearing ineffec=
tive on the international stage. With midterm elections just over a year aw=
ay, the timeline for demonstrating diplomatic leverage is shortening, makin=
g any delay potentially damaging at home and abroad. Even if a deal fails t=
o materialize, Trump must act decisively to show that he controls the rules=
 of the engagement and to counter the perception that Moscow is exploiting =
his desire for diplomacy. Washington's move on Wednesday to sanction Rosnef=
t and Lukoil, Russia's largest oil companies, is evidence of the administra=
tion's sensitivity to charges of weakness.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Beyond domestic po=
litics, a deeper geopolitical logic underpins Washington=E2=80=99s current =
approach to Ukraine: Washington is fundamentally overhauling its 80-year-ol=
d geostrategy, moving from global primacy toward a model of selective engag=
ement and regional burden-sharing. This transition would have allies and pa=
rtner nations assuming primary responsibility for security in their respect=
ive regions, with Washington playing a supporting role. In Europe, U.S. pol=
icy rests on the premise that Russia, though capable of disruption, is no l=
onger the threat to the U.S. that the Soviet Union was.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Certainly, the war=
 in Ukraine has shown that Russia falls well short of the military and indu=
strial might that the Soviets possessed. After nearly four years of fightin=
g, Moscow's failures underscore the erosion of its conventional power and t=
he limits of its mobilization capacity. Russia will need years to rebuild i=
ts economic base, replenish its arsenal and restore force readiness, dimini=
shing its ability to threaten Europe in the near term. In the meantime, Rus=
sia will try to gain as much territory in eastern Ukraine as possible as it=
 waits for Washington to continue its withdrawal from the global stage, aft=
er which it will exploit strategic opportunities in Europe as they emerge.<=
/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This strategy has =
a couple of problems that Moscow is all too aware of. First and more immedi=
ately, the continued rejection of Trump=E2=80=99s diplomatic overtures risk=
s escalation. The U.S. could respond by supplying additional military aid t=
o Ukraine that could lead to real battlefield reversals. The Kremlin, for i=
ts part, recognizes how Trump=E2=80=99s political imperatives will influenc=
e his willingness to act decisively. As a result, there are limits to how f=
ar Russia can delay or continue to manipulate negotiations without incurrin=
g costs.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Second, over the l=
ong term the U.S. will not simply transfer the security burden to its Europ=
ean allies once a peace deal is achieved. Any retrenchment will depend on t=
he creation of robust mechanisms to guarantee regional stability without di=
rect U.S. intervention. In practice, the U.S. will stand down only as Europ=
ean partners stand up. This approach assumes that Russia poses no threat th=
at Europe cannot manage. If that is not the case, then the U.S. is prepared=
 to delay or recalibrate its geostrategic realignment to safeguard European=
 security and U.S. interests.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">After all, it is n=
ot in Washington=E2=80=99s interest for a hostile power in Europe to gain a=
ccess to the Atlantic Ocean. This has been a major historical imperative of=
 the United States since the Monroe Doctrine. As an oceanic and global powe=
r, Washington cannot allow threats to North America or the broader Western =
Hemisphere. So no matter how committed Washington is to drawing down from E=
urope, the Trump administration will refrain from pulling out of the Contin=
ent in a way that leaves it vulnerable to Russia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This is why two se=
nior Kremlin officials =E2=80=93 Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Deput=
y Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov =E2=80=93 emphasized on Oct. 22 that prep=
arations for a summit in Budapest are imminent. Russia and the U.S. have in=
centives to tacitly accept the de facto partition of Ukraine as a framework=
 for negotiations. Trump has proposed that Russian and Ukrainian forces hal=
t fighting along the existing battle lines to stabilize the situation. The =
remaining question is where the line of control will ultimately be drawn.</=
