DAILY MEMO: ON THE VERGE OF A GAZA PEACE DEAL [3]
WASHINGTON HOPES TO FINALIZE AN AGREEMENT THIS WEEK IN CAIRO.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
ISRAEL-HAMAS NEGOTIATIONS. U.S. President Donald Trump reported positive results [4] from talks with Hamas and other nations regarding a Gaza ceasefire, hostage release and broader regional peace. The
U.S. hopes to finalize an agreement [5] during negotiations in Cairo, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. Hamas reportedly agreed to release hostages but asked Israel to pause airstrikes [6] so that
it may recover dead hostages around Gaza. The group also demanded [7] that Israel withdraw its tanks from populated areas to facilitate hostage transfers, and it is insisting on the release of six
high-ranking Palestinian prisoners. Hamas also denied [8] Arab media reports that it intends to surrender its weapons.
DEALS AND DRILLS. Senior Indian Defense Ministry officials will meet with their Russian counterparts this week to discuss jointly producing or directly purchasing five additional S-400 air defense
systems [9] from Moscow to strengthen India’s long-range defense capabilities. According to defense sources who spoke to the Hindustan Times, the deal is expected to be approved before Russian
President Vladimir Putin arrives in India on Dec. 5 for an annual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Meanwhile, Russia and India have launched the joint exercise [10] Indra-2025 in Rajasthan,
northwest India. The drills, which will run until Oct. 15, will focus on joint tactical operations, communications, and command and control of a combined force. Separately, Putin threatened to sever
ties [11] with the United States if Washington supplies Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.
ELECTION UNREST. Tens of thousands of protesters [12] gathered in Georgia’s capital on Saturday after the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in municipal elections boycotted by the main
opposition blocs. Several dozen protesters stormed the courtyard of the presidential residence [13] in Tbilisi, and 14 police officers were reportedly injured. On Sunday, Prime Minister Irakli
Kobakhidze said foreign intelligence services had attempted a coup [14] in his country. Georgian Dream last year suspended talks on joining the European Union.
NEW WARSHIP. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected [15] the country’s first 5,000-ton multipurpose destroyer on Sunday. The new destroyer is equipped with supersonic strategic cruise missiles
and tactical ballistic missiles, state media reported. Pyongyang plans to build another vessel of the same class by October 2026.
BACK IN BUSINESS. Libya’s National Oil Corp. announced the resumption of exploration [16] in several offshore blocks that had been dormant for more than five years. The work, conducted with
Italy’s Eni, follows technical and environmental assessments and focuses on northwestern Libya, where instability previously halted operations. Eni has begun seismic and geological surveys ahead of
drilling new exploratory wells.
CIRCUMVENTION. China is developing a land corridor through Iran to reduce reliance on vulnerable sea lanes such as the Strait of Malacca and Bab el-Mandeb, according to the Iranian news agency Wana. A
new rail link between Xian, China, and the Iranian port of Apirin opens a trade route that strengthens Chinese access to Western Asia and Europe. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that a
secret agreement between Beijing and Tehran, involving a major Chinese insurance firm, allows China to skirt U.S. sanctions and pay for Iranian oil through infrastructure projects.
REDENOMINATION. On Sunday, the Iranian parliament approved a bill to redenominate the national currency [17]. Under the amended Monetary and Banking Law, the Central Bank of Iran will set exchange
rates and manage foreign currency transactions in line with reserves. A three-year “dual circulation” transition phase will allow both currencies to circulate simultaneously. The reform had been
debated for years amid inflation and depreciation.
ICE UNDER ATTACK. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Mexican cartels, gangs and terror groups have placed bounties on U.S. immigration agents [18] and launched a doxing campaign to
distribute agents’ photos through criminal networks. Noem cited violent incidents including a sniper attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas and an attempted ambush of
agents in Chicago. She said that intelligence suggests these groups are increasingly organized and that authorities are investigating funding for coordinated protests against federal law enforcement.
FIRST VISIT. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi may visit India [19] from Oct. 9 to Oct. 16, marking the first visit to India by a senior Taliban official since the group seized power in 2021.
Although India does not recognize the Taliban government, it has maintained a minimal diplomatic presence in Kabul since 2022 to facilitate humanitarian aid and to protect its interests. India’s
Ministry of External Affairs temporarily waived a travel ban for the visit. Muttaqi’s visit is expected to focus on regional security and trade.
NAVAL CONFERENCE. Iranian Navy Commander Rear Adm. Shahram Irani arrived [20] in St. Petersburg on Sunday to attend a meeting of naval commanders from Caspian Sea states. In addition to participating
in the conference, Irani will meet with the Russian Navy’s commander-in-chief, hold bilateral talks with the naval chiefs of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and visit naval bases in the Gulf of Finland.
NEW ALLIANCE. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister James Marape signed a mutual defense treaty [21] Monday in Canberra. Known as the Pukpuk Treaty, the pact
is Australia’s first new alliance in more than 70 years and only its third overall, alongside those with New Zealand and the United States. The treaty commits both nations to mutual defense in the
event of attack and is aimed at countering China’s growing regional influence.
