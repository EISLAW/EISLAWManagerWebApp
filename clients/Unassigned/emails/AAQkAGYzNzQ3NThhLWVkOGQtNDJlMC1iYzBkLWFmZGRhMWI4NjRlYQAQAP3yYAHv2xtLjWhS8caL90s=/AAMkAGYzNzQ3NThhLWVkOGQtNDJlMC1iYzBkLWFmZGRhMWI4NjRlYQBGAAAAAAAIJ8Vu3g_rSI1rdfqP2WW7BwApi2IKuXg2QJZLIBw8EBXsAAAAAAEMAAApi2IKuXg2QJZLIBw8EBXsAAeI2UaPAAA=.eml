THE SAUDI-PAKISTANI DEFENSE PACT AND GAZA [3]
WASHINGTON’S STRATEGY HINGES ON RIYADH, BUT THE KINGDOM’S LIMITED CAPABILITIES LEAVE IT DEPENDENT ON PARTNERS WITH COMPETING AGENDAS.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
As the U.S. reduces its role in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia – encouraged by Washington – is forging a new regional security architecture. The Trump administration would like to see Riyadh take
the lead in forming and deploying a multinational task force in Gaza, but the Saudis are ill-equipped for such a responsibility. They could rely on Turkey’s expertise – and indeed will need to
work with the Turks and the Israelis to manage Gaza – but Riyadh has a deep interest in preventing Ankara from extending its influence deeper into the Arab world. It is in this context that Saudi
Arabia last week signed a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan.
[The Middle East & South Asia] [4]
_(click to enlarge)_ [5]
On Sept. 23, U.S. President Donald Trump met with the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countries on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session. A day later, Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan hailed the meeting – attended by Erdogan, the president of Indonesia, the prime ministers of Pakistan and Egypt, the emir of Qatar, the king of Jordan, and the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – as “fruitful” and “successful.” The U.S., according to Axios’ reporting, wants these eight countries to form a military task force and deploy it in
Gaza to facilitate Israel’s withdrawal.
The U.S. request is part of a new global strategy designed to reduce the burden on Washington to police the globe. Instead, it wants allies and partners to take the lead in their respective regions,
with the U.S. playing a secondary role. The most prominent example of this shift is in Europe, where U.S. allies are beginning to assume this collective security responsibility.
Such an approach is relatively simple to implement in the European context, where a regional bloc of advanced economies, the European Union, already exists. More important, Washington’s European
allies have considerable military capabilities and generally can agree on a primary threat, Russia, especially in the context of the Ukraine war. However, despite these advantages, the European
solution to the U.S. demand has been to work within the NATO framework – where the U.S. is the dominant force and the head of Allied Command Operations is always a U.S. officer – and circumvent
the difficulties of forming a new entity and agreeing on the issue of command.
Operationalizing the new U.S. approach in the Middle East is much more complicated. For starters, the three major U.S. allies in the region (Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel) have significant
disagreements with one another. In addition, although Iran is a serious threat to all three countries, it is also a major player within the region, and it threatens them in unique ways. Nevertheless,
Washington is pressuring Riyadh to assume responsibility [6] for managing the affairs of the Arab world and to work with Turkey and Israel. At the same time, the U.S. is still trying on its own to
force Iran to give up its revisionist goals in the region.
In an effort to create its desired balance of power, the Trump administration has been working on two fronts. First, it is pushing Turkey and Israel to reduce their mutual tensions, especially
regarding Syria. Second, it is promoting its signature initiative, the Abraham Accords, designed to normalize relations between the Arab states and Israel. In the meantime, Turkey has greatly improved
relations with Saudi Arabia.
Israel’s military operations in Gaza and beyond in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack greatly complicated matters, especially for Saudi Arabia. Shortly after Israel launched a retaliatory
bombing campaign in Gaza, the Saudis suspended normalization talks with the Israelis. If Riyadh tried to pick up the negotiations – which were reportedly at an advanced stage – while Israeli
forces were still engaged in ground operations in Gaza, it would suffer a catastrophic blow to its reputation at home and in the Muslim world. The U.S. hopes instead that, after it brings an end to
the fighting in Gaza, Saudi Arabia will take the lead in providing security in the strip [7]. In other words, Washington’s vision is that the Saudis and the Israelis will work together to manage
Gaza.
For the U.S., dealing with Israel is the relatively easy part. The serious problems start with the envisioned Arab-Muslim coalition of forces, which the Saudis lack the military capability to lead.
Turkey, on the other hand, is quite capable of assuming command [8], but Riyadh does not want Ankara to gain disproportionate influence in the Arab world. Turkey has already seized a major role in
Syria [9], leaving Saudi Arabia scrambling to contain it.
To augment its own military strength, Saudi Arabia turned to its decades-old South Asian ally, Pakistan. Under their mutual defense agreement, Riyadh will provide the financial firepower and Islamabad
will provide the troops. Not only will this compensate for Saudi Arabia’s lack of an experienced fighting force, but it will also help it counterbalance Turkey, which reigned over large parts of the
Middle East as recently as the early 20th century and still has great-power ambitions. Pakistan and Turkey are close allies as well, but Islamabad will try to avoid getting caught between them, and
its financial dependency on Riyadh should provide the latter with decisive leverage in most cases.
For now, there are three key questions: What will be the command structure of the Pakistani forces that will likely be deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of the defense pact? What will be the structure
of the potential multinational task force for Gaza? And how will Saudi Arabia and Pakistan work with Israel to manage security in Gaza?

ton =E2=80=93 is forging a new regional security architecture. The Trump ad=

Gaza =E2=80=93 but Riyadh has a deep interest in preventing Ankara from ext=
ending its influence deeper into the Arab world. It is in this context that=
 Saudi Arabia last week signed a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan.</p=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On Sept. 23, U.S. =
President Donald Trump met with the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countr=
ies on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session. A day later, Tur=
kish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the meeting =E2=80=93 attended b=
y Erdogan, the president of Indonesia, the prime ministers of Pakistan and =
Egypt, the emir of Qatar, the king of Jordan, and the foreign ministers of =
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates =E2=80=93 as =E2=80=9Cfruitful=E2=
=80=9D and =E2=80=9Csuccessful.=E2=80=9D The U.S., according to Axios=E2=80=
=99 reporting, wants these eight countries to form a military task force an=
d deploy it in Gaza to facilitate Israel=E2=80=99s withdrawal.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. request i=
s part of a new global strategy designed to reduce the burden on Washington=
 to police the globe. Instead, it wants allies and partners to take the lea=
d in their respective regions, with the U.S. playing a secondary role. The =
most prominent example of this shift is in Europe, where U.S. allies are be=
ginning to assume this collective security responsibility.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Such an approach i=
s relatively simple to implement in the European context, where a regional =
bloc of advanced economies, the European Union, already exists. More import=
ant, Washington=E2=80=99s European allies have considerable military capabi=
lities and generally can agree on a primary threat, Russia, especially in t=
he context of the Ukraine war. However, despite these advantages, the Europ=
ean solution to the U.S. demand has been to work within the NATO framework =
=E2=80=93 where the U.S. is the dominant force and the head of Allied Comma=
nd Operations is always a U.S. officer =E2=80=93 and circumvent the difficu=
lties of forming a new entity and agreeing on the issue of command.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Operationalizing t=
he new U.S. approach in the Middle East is much more complicated. For start=
ers, the three major U.S. allies in the region (Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Is=
rael) have significant disagreements with one another. In addition, althoug=
h Iran is a serious threat to all three countries, it is also a major playe=
r within the region, and it threatens them in unique ways. Nevertheless, Wa=
shington is pressuring <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/=

e responsibility</a> for managing the affairs of the Arab world and to work=
 with Turkey and Israel. At the same time, the U.S. is still trying on its =
own to force Iran to give up its revisionist goals in the region.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In an effort to cr=
eate its desired balance of power, the Trump administration has been workin=
g on two fronts. First, it is pushing Turkey and Israel to reduce their mut=
ual tensions, especially regarding Syria. Second, it is promoting its signa=
ture initiative, the Abraham Accords, designed to normalize relations betwe=
en the Arab states and Israel. In the meantime, Turkey has greatly improved=
 relations with Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s m=
ilitary operations in Gaza and beyond in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hama=
s attack greatly complicated matters, especially for Saudi Arabia. Shortly =
after Israel launched a retaliatory bombing campaign in Gaza, the Saudis su=
spended normalization talks with the Israelis. If Riyadh tried to pick up t=
he negotiations =E2=80=93 which were reportedly at an advanced stage =E2=80=
=93 while Israeli forces were still engaged in ground operations in Gaza, i=
t would suffer a catastrophic blow to its reputation at home and in the Mus=
lim world. The U.S. hopes instead that, after it brings an end to the fight=
ing in Gaza, Saudi Arabia will take the lead in providing <a href=3D"https:=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For the U.S., deal=

 military capability to lead. Turkey, on the other hand, is quite <a href=

contain it.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">To augment its own=
 military strength, Saudi Arabia turned to its decades-old South Asian ally=
, Pakistan. Under their mutual defense agreement, Riyadh will provide the f=
inancial firepower and Islamabad will provide the troops. Not only will thi=
s compensate for Saudi Arabia=E2=80=99s lack of an experienced fighting for=
ce, but it will also help it counterbalance Turkey, which reigned over larg=
e parts of the Middle East as recently as the early 20th century and still =
has great-power ambitions. Pakistan and Turkey are close allies as well, bu=
t Islamabad will try to avoid getting caught between them, and its financia=
l dependency on Riyadh should provide the latter with decisive leverage in =
most cases.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For now, there are=
 three key questions: What will be the command structure of the Pakistani f=
orces that will likely be deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of the defense p=
act? What will be the structure of the potential multinational task force f=
or Gaza? And how will Saudi Arabia and Pakistan work with Israel to manage =
security in Gaza?</p>
