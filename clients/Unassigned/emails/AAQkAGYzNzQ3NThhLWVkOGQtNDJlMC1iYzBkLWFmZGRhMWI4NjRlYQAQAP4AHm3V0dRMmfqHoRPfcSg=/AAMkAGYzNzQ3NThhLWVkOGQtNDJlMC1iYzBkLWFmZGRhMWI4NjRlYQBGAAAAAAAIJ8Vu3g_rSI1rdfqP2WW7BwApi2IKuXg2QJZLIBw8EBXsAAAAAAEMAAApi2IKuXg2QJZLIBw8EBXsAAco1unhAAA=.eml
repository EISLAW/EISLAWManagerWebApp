Dear Subscriber=2C

Every letter sent in reaction to articles we write is read by us all on th=
e team.  For years almost every letter has been answered.  However we have=
 reached a level of readership (happily) with a list of recipients of our=
 publication of over 40=2C000=2C where answering each email individually h=
as become impossible for me. For a year I have been personally struggling=
 with this problem=2C with genuine feelings of guilt as I feel both obliga=
ted and delighted to reply especially to my critics.  But the system has c=
ollapsed.

We are introducing a second best solution.

In general the criticisms of a particular article are repeated by many and=
 can be consolidated into a single if lengthy critique. Instead of repeati=
ng myself with slight variations in many answers we will gather the essenc=
e of the comments and especially challenges and criticisms that have been=
 leveled in the past week. I will then craft a response=2C which is emaile=
d out to all subscribers (excluding the names of those who wrote the comme=
nts) but they will likely know who they are.

This gives the many readers who don=E2=80=99t send comments to us a chance=
 to see what others are thinking=2C and likely many of them  have the same=
 questions and doubts about what I write.

With my article on the geopolitics of tariffs=2C I received a large number=
 of comments questioning my sanity in not seeing Donald Trump as unstable=
 and unsuited to govern=2C and accusing me of pro-Trump sympathies for dep=
ersonalizing the tariffs.  While I answered some of those criticisms in an=
 article later=2C I did not answer in detail. So I have begun by consolida=
ting and answering the major criticisms made in that article.

This is an imperfect system to be sure and obviously we may fail to succes=
sfully consolidate all of your thoughts into this system=2C but we will do=
 our best.

Part of my regret in not being able to answer individual emails is because=
 of the pleasure of interacting and arguing with my critics personally (I=
 actually love doing that) and building relationships. Our other analysts=
 who normally get less criticisms than I do will continue to answer emails=
 individually.  And for all of you who do praise or agree with something I=
 write I just say a general grateful thank you. And for those not interest=
ed in reading these=2C just hit the delete button.

With respect and gratitude.

George


** The Geopolitics of Tariffs
------------------------------------------------------------

April 7=2C 2025

Criticism: George=E2=80=99s views on Trump are na=C3=AFve=2C biased and gi=
ve Trump too much credit

Response: As I have long said=2C Presidents and even tyrants arise because=
 they grasp the reality of the moment=2C and the manner in which the peopl=
e experience them. They craft their personalities to fit the moment but th=
ey are the products of the moment and the democratic process. Trump was el=
ected by the American people=2C along with its Congress because they saw s=
omething in him that they liked.  Thinking of Trump as incompetent or dera=
nged may be true=2C but it is also an attack on democracy.  There was no d=
oubt as to who he was before he was elected=2C and he was democratically e=
lected. While it is also democratic for a powerful segment of the populati=
on to despise him=2C it is essential to also see what his opponents see in=
 him is not what his proponents see.  So in that sense he is our leader be=
cause we chose him as a nation.

Franklin D. Roosevelt also governed in his first hundred days issuing 99 E=
xecutive orders not validated by Congress=2C and opposed by the courts whi=
ch he ignored=2C and tried to add two members to the court to outvote his=
 opponents there. History now admires Roosevelt=E2=80=99s domestic and for=
eign policy=2C but at the time he was seen as a monster by a powerful mino=
rity.

I might add that in my book =E2=80=9CThe Storm Before the Calm=E2=80=9D I=
 predicted that we will elect a President who will end the prior cycle (wh=
ich began 50 years earlier) and would create a storm that would preface th=
e new one.  Roosevelt=2C facing a similar moment=2C crafted himself for th=
e moment. A vastly wealth man=2C who knew nothing of the poor=2C he nevert=
heless crafted himself as the friend of the poor=2C and was treated as a t=
raitor to  his class.  Among his 99 Executive orders were some that wrecke=
d the banking system in the face of Supreme  Court rulings against him.  H=
e was at the time worshiped by his supporters and loathed by his opponents=
=2E  He  was widely regarded as a dilettante and self-aggrandizing who was v=
iolating all of the norms of American life.

Like Washington=2C Jackson=2C Lincoln and the others who faced dramatic sh=
ifts in the reality of America Roosevelt was regarded as a loathsome creat=
ure ruining the country. John Adams said at the time that one-third of the=
 country was for the revolution=2C one third were loyalists and one third=
 didn=E2=80=99t care.  He summed up the reality of cyclical change. Those=
 who demand the norm of an obsolete past hated Washington and the rest wit=
h a passion and contempt that is hard for us to imagine. And so too with T=
rump. My book argued that the fundamental institutions and social and econ=
omic conditions were obsolete and would be reengineered. And I predicted a=
 storm. By being not very bright=2C I could see the obvious=2C the obsoles=
cence of the federal system Roosevelt had to construct during his presiden=
cy to end the depression=2C the vast cultural division that divided the co=
untry and so on.  At cyclical historical points the kind of presidents we=
 elect appear to many as reckless and witless=2C while those who
elect him sigh in relief.  This is America reinventing itself. With this m=
odel I can understand and respect those who loathe him=2C and also those w=
ho adore him. I cannot predict how history will regard him=2C but the hist=
orical presidents who were loathed by those who opposed him=2C emerged as=
 great men. It is hard to imagine Trump as a great man=2C but then Lincoln=
=2C in his day=2C was called an illiterate monkey.

So Trump in violating the norm is obnoxious to many=2C but he is in fact t=
he norm that arrives every fifty years as the republic reinvents itself.

Question: Why/how does the system of free trade harm the USA or cause cost=
s?

Response: Free trade emerged as a principle after World War II.  It emerge=
d as a tool for containing the Soviets.  Free trade allowed Europe to econ=
omically revive=2C because while there was no internal demand for goods=2C=
 with Europe was shattered=2C the ability of the US to absorb European exp=
orts=2C with low cost European products=2C revived the European economy an=
d fit the American geopolitical interests.  The free trade principle was b=
ased on the need to revive Europe=2C at some cost to the United States eco=
nomically=2C but of great value geopolitically.  The principle of free tra=
de=2C coupled with foreign aid=2C continued as Europe=E2=80=99s empires co=
llapsed and they were renamed the third world. The US and Russia fought pr=
oxy wars throughout the cold war=2C with the US gaining massive advantage=
 by allowing free trade to flourish=2C and providing foreign aid=2C both o=
f which helped block Soviet power=2C since it did not have economic power=
 to match the US.  But this was the norm only in the last 80 years of the=
 Cold
War. And it has allowed imbalances that the US no longer needs to bear geo=
politically as the Russians weaken.

Free trade can also be dangerous.  Having relatively free trade with China=
=2C allowed low cost Chinese labor to export critical elements needed by t=
he industrial base for low costs.  But it created a grave danger. If you r=
ecall in the 1970s=2C there was an Arab Oil Embargo which for a time shatt=
ered the American economy.  With free trade decreasing cost of goods in Am=
erica=2C if the goods we need to run our industries are embargoed=2C or th=
ere is unrest in a country we depend on=2C the US is vulnerable to disaste=
r.  So free trade existed while the geopolitical interest of the US requir=
ed it. But it also created great risks. Today=2C the relatively free trade=
 system has created a dependency on foreign nations that can collapse if C=
hina would choose to embargo shipments for geopolitical reasons=2C or unre=
st in China would make production there decline=E2=80=94or there may be an=
 earthquake in Shanghai.  Free trade gives economic benefits as well as ge=
opolitical ones=2C but as times change they can be traps. Obviously
the shift away from free trade=2C to the norm prior to the last 80 years=
=2C is financially painful in the extreme=2C and Trump=E2=80=99s engineeri=
ng is maximizing the pain=2C but I think his intention is to impose short=
 term chaos for a long term increase in national security and wealth.  So=
 the value of free trade depends on the circumstances. I am not sure of th=
e wisdom of his method=2C but the dangers of free trade are as clear as th=
eir benefits=2C but it depends on the risk.  Tariffs in the long run mitig=
ate the risks balancing them against the advantage.

Comments on Trump:
* Trump doesn=E2=80=99t understand geopolitics=2C nor does he have strateg=
y.
* Trump is always transactional=2C opportunistic=2C uses poor economic fou=
ndations and holds no value/use for allies.
* Trump=E2=80=99s actions will destroy US Dollar dominance and result in U=
S exclusion from new trade alliances

Response: All diplomacy is transactional. The diplomatic process is a proc=
ess of finding a balance between nations. So I don=E2=80=99t see how the c=
harge of transactional views is a valid criticism. It depends on the trans=
action.  I do think that any President at this point would be viewing that=
 the geopolitical system we have had is now obsolete.  If Russia could not=
 conquer Ukraine in 3 years=2C it certainly can=E2=80=99t invade Europe. T=
herefore the purpose of NATO is obsolete both in terms of Europe=E2=80=99s=
 vast economic recovery=2C and Russia=E2=80=99s military decline. The logi=
c of the Cold war no longer holds.  But since the Europeans liked the prio=
r American solicitude=2C with good reason=2C they see the US shift as reck=
less. But 80 years for a geopolitical system to remain unchanged is extrao=
rdinary.  Sophisticated people have trouble=2C having adapted to a norm=2C=
 understanding the norm=E2=80=99s obsolescence. It takes a lack of sophist=
ication to see the obvious. God knows that Trump appears unsophisticated=
=2C but there is power in
recognizing obsolescence of cultural and geopolitical norms. I think any o=
ther president at this moment in history would be doing the same thing=2C=
 albeit more gracefully.  However is breaking the norm possible without ba=
d manners?

Re-engineering comments: (these are very close to the original emails text=
)

Engineering analogy:  Think of President Donald Trump's recent actions as=
 building a bridge to cross a river.  A blueprint for redefining the syste=
m must be designed=2C though the outcome of Trump's initial actions is unc=
ertain=2C even if their intent seems clear. Wise Engineering would proceed=
 with a much more deliberate plan with a clear way forward at a measured p=
ace. Trump=E2=80=99s approach results in chaos and distrust of making agre=
ements with the US.

It is difficult to make blue  prints in geopolitics. In engineering the bl=
ueprints are frequently revised as they encounter new realities.  Engineer=
ing is the craft of designing things that work=2C and the initial blueprin=
t is frequently revised and sometimes abandoned for a new one.  Blueprints=
 are drawn up when reality requires a new building=2C but the blueprints a=
re rarely the final word. I think Trump=E2=80=99s blue print is to first t=
ear down the building see what is left=2C and innovate in rebuilding.  We=
 will see if it works.  However a blueprint is frequently a fantasy that t=
raps engineers in failure.  There is something to be said for engineering=
 an intent into reality without committing to an overall plan. But then I=
 am far from a handyman around the house and my  wife won=E2=80=99t let me=
 hold a hammer.

Additional considerations for re-engineering will have to take into accoun=
t that:

- Europeans will remain wary of a Russian resurgence=2C whatever Russia's=
 current weakness
- the US derives significant wealth from its imperium (it's an economic on=
e)=2C and its domestic stability (as well as the wealth of its wealthiest)=
 depends on the availability of cheap products for an underpaid and to som=
e extent government supported workforce. Looks like this is going to be te=
sted soon.

The Europeans have a prior problem. In the 80 years since the war the Euro=
peans are still the discrete nations that they were for centuries=2C centu=
ries in which they waged the bloodiest wars imaginable against each other.=
 The European have not evolved into a single federal nation=2C but engage=
 in things like the European Union and Nato in lieu of becoming a nation s=
tate=2C with a European government that can wage war. Europe has vast econ=
omic resources for defense=2C but its geopolitical condition remains the s=
ame as it was when Europe tore itself to bits.  This was prevented by the=
 American presence=2C but during that time the Europeans failed to build t=
he kind of institutions that would bind them together against a Russian th=
reat=2C which is in my mind much diminished=2C and was never quite as cred=
ible as the US thought=2C but we overreact which is not a bad thing.

However=2C after 80 years there is no such thing as a European army or a E=
uropean foreign policy. Each nation is sovereign and few act in concert. =
 There is now growing tension between France and Germany=2C nothing danger=
ous but not something that should be possible now. I served in Europe in t=
he 1970s when European anti-Americanism was at a peak. It was not pleasant=
 and I was born in Europe.  So the problem of Europe is not that it could=
 not easily repel a Russian invasion=2C it is that Europe is the name of a=
 continent and not a nation=2C and they have failed to create a European n=
ation. At the moment=2C there is no real threat from Russia and for the Eu=
ropeans you don=E2=80=99t fix the roof when it doesn=E2=80=99t rain becaus=
e there is no leak=2C and then don=E2=80=99t fix it when it does because i=
t is raining. The United States spent two world wars and eighty years deal=
ing with Europe=E2=80=99s disease. When I was an American in Paris I was n=
ot an honored guest but an imperialist occupier. Of course I was hanging a=
round the
Sorbonne hoping for a date.  As a European whose parents had been in Germa=
n concentration camps=2C and who had to flee the communists in Hungary whe=
n I was an infant=2C then later served there and frequently visit=2C I fin=
d the Europeans to be unwilling=2C not unable=2C to defend themselves. I d=
on=E2=80=99t want my grandchildren to compensate for their irresponsibilit=
y.  But that is less geopolitical analysis than very satisfying venting.

I hope this mode of answering questions works for you.  And I hope that th=
ose of you offended by my answers understand that counter to my staff=E2=
=80=99s belief=2C I am human=2C and in writing to you in this context I am=
 prepared to reveal some personal feelings.

To emphasize=2C I read every email you send and welcome this way to respon=
d.  I hope it is of value to you as well.  See you next week.

scriber,<br>
<br>
Every letter sent in reaction to articles we write is read by us all on the=
 team.&nbsp; For years almost every letter has been answered.&nbsp; However=
 we have reached a level of readership (happily) with a list of recipients =
of our publication of over 40,000, where answering each email individually =
has become impossible for me. For a year I have been personally struggling =
with this problem, with genuine feelings of guilt as I feel both obligated =
and delighted to reply especially to my critics.&nbsp; But the system has c=
ollapsed.<br>
<br>
We are introducing a second best solution.<br>
<br>
In general the criticisms of a particular article are repeated by many and =
can be consolidated into a single if lengthy critique. Instead of repeating=
 myself with slight variations in many answers we will gather the essence o=
f the comments and especially challenges and criticisms that have been leve=
led in the past week. I will then craft a response, which is emailed out to=
 all subscribers (excluding the names of those who wrote the comments) but =
they will likely know who they are.<br>
<br>
This gives the many readers who don=E2=80=99t send comments to us a chance =
to see what others are thinking, and likely many of them &nbsp;have the sam=
e questions and doubts about what I write.<br>
<br>
With my article on the geopolitics of tariffs, I received a large number of=
 comments questioning my sanity in not seeing Donald Trump as unstable and =
unsuited to govern, and accusing me of pro-Trump sympathies for depersonali=
zing the tariffs.&nbsp; While I answered some of those criticisms in an art=
icle later, I did not answer in detail. So I have begun by consolidating an=
d answering the major criticisms made in that article.<br>
<br>
This is an imperfect system to be sure and obviously we may fail to success=
fully consolidate all of your thoughts into this system, but we will do our=
 best.<br>
<br>
Part of my regret in not being able to answer individual emails is because =
of the pleasure of interacting and arguing with my critics personally (I ac=
tually love doing that) and building relationships. Our other analysts who =
normally get less criticisms than I do will continue to answer emails indiv=
idually.&nbsp; And for all of you who do praise or agree with something I w=
rite I just say a general grateful thank you. And for those not interested =
in reading these, just hit the delete button.<br>
<br>
With respect and gratitude.<br>
<br>
George</p>

Criticism: </strong>George=E2=80=99s views on Trump are na=C3=AFve, biased =
and give Trump too much credit<br>
<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> As I have long said, Presidents and even tyrants=
 arise because they grasp the reality of the moment, and the manner in whic=
h the people experience them. They craft their personalities to fit the mom=
ent but they are the products of the moment and the democratic process. Tru=
mp was elected by the American people, along with its Congress because they=
 saw something in him that they liked.&nbsp; Thinking of Trump as incompete=
nt or deranged may be true, but it is also an attack on democracy.&nbsp; Th=
ere was no doubt as to who he was before he was elected, and he was democra=
tically elected. While it is also democratic for a powerful segment of the =
population to despise him, it is essential to also see what his opponents s=
ee in him is not what his proponents see.&nbsp; So in that sense he is our =
leader because we chose him as a nation.<br>
<br>
Franklin D. Roosevelt also governed in his first hundred days issuing 99 Ex=
ecutive orders not validated by Congress, and opposed by the courts which h=
e ignored, and tried to add two members to the court to outvote his opponen=
ts there. History now admires Roosevelt=E2=80=99s domestic and foreign poli=
cy, but at the time he was seen as a monster by a powerful minority.<br>
<br>
I might add that in my book =E2=80=9CThe Storm Before the Calm=E2=80=9D I p=
redicted that we will elect a President who will end the prior cycle (which=
 began 50 years earlier) and would create a storm that would preface the ne=
w one. &nbsp;Roosevelt, facing a similar moment, crafted himself for the mo=
ment. A vastly wealth man, who knew nothing of the poor, he nevertheless cr=
afted himself as the friend of the poor, and was treated as a traitor to&nb=
sp; his class. &nbsp;Among his 99 Executive orders were some that wrecked t=
he banking system in the face of Supreme&nbsp; Court rulings against him.&n=
bsp; He was at the time worshiped by his supporters and loathed by his oppo=
nents.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was widely regarded as a <span aria-level=3D"1" class=
=3D"yKMVIe" role=3D"heading">dilettante</span> and self-aggrandizing who wa=
s violating all of the norms of American life.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Like Washington, Jackson, Lincoln and the others who faced dramatic shifts =
in the reality of America Roosevelt was regarded as a loathsome creature ru=
ining the country. John Adams said at the time that one-third of the countr=
y was for the revolution, one third were loyalists and one third didn=E2=80=
=99t care.&nbsp; He summed up the reality of cyclical change. Those who dem=
and the norm of an obsolete past hated Washington and the rest with a passi=
on and contempt that is hard for us to imagine. And so too with Trump. My b=
ook argued that the fundamental institutions and social and economic condit=
ions were obsolete and would be reengineered. And I predicted a storm. By b=
eing not very bright, I could see the obvious, the obsolescence of the fede=
ral system Roosevelt had to construct during his presidency to end the depr=
ession, the vast cultural division that divided the country and so on.&nbsp=
; At cyclical historical points the kind of presidents we elect appear to m=
any as reckless and witless, while those who elect him sigh in relief.&nbsp=
; This is America reinventing itself. With this model I can understand and =
respect those who loathe him, and also those who adore him. I cannot predic=
t how history will regard him, but the historical presidents who were loath=
ed by those who opposed him, emerged as great men. It is hard to imagine Tr=
ump as a great man, but then Lincoln, in his day, was called an illiterate =
monkey.<br>
<br>
So Trump in violating the norm is obnoxious to many, but he is in fact the =
norm that arrives every fifty years as the republic reinvents itself.&nbsp;=
<br>
<br>
<strong>Question: </strong>Why/how does the system of free trade harm the U=
SA or cause costs?<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Free trade emerged as a principle after World Wa=
r II.&nbsp; It emerged as a tool for containing the Soviets.&nbsp; Free tra=
de allowed Europe to economically revive, because while there was no intern=
al demand for goods, with Europe was shattered, the ability of the US to ab=
sorb European exports, with low cost European products, revived the Europea=
n economy and fit the American geopolitical interests.&nbsp; The free trade=
 principle was based on the need to revive Europe, at some cost to the Unit=
ed States economically, but of great value geopolitically.&nbsp; The princi=
ple of free trade, coupled with foreign aid, continued as Europe=E2=80=99s =
empires collapsed and they were renamed the third world. The US and Russia =
fought proxy wars throughout the cold war, with the US gaining massive adva=
ntage by allowing free trade to flourish, and providing foreign aid, both o=
f which helped block Soviet power, since it did not have economic power to =
match the US.&nbsp; But this was the norm only in the last 80 years of the =
Cold War. And it has allowed imbalances that the US no longer needs to bear=
 geopolitically as the Russians weaken.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Free trade can also be dangerous.&nbsp; Having relatively free trade with C=
hina, allowed low cost Chinese labor to export critical elements needed by =
the industrial base for low costs.&nbsp; But it created a grave danger. If =
you recall in the 1970s, there was an Arab Oil Embargo which for a time sha=
ttered the American economy.&nbsp; With free trade decreasing cost of goods=
 in America, if the goods we need to run our industries are embargoed, or t=
here is unrest in a country we depend on, the US is vulnerable to disaster.=
&nbsp; So free trade existed while the geopolitical interest of the US requ=
ired it. But it also created great risks. Today, the relatively free trade =
system has created a dependency on foreign nations that can collapse if Chi=
na would choose to embargo shipments for geopolitical reasons, or unrest in=
 China would make production there decline=E2=80=94or there may be an earth=
quake in Shanghai.&nbsp; Free trade gives economic benefits as well as geop=
olitical ones, but as times change they can be traps. Obviously the shift a=
way from free trade, to the norm prior to the last 80 years, is financially=
 painful in the extreme, and Trump=E2=80=99s engineering is maximizing the =
pain, but I think his intention is to impose short term chaos for a long te=
rm increase in national security and wealth.&nbsp; So the value of free tra=
de depends on the circumstances. I am not sure of the wisdom of his method,=
 but the dangers of free trade are as clear as their benefits, but it depen=
ds on the risk.&nbsp; Tariffs in the long run mitigate the risks balancing =
them against the advantage.<br>

</ul>
<br>
<strong>Response:</strong> All diplomacy is transactional. The diplomatic p=
rocess is a process of finding a balance between nations. So I don=E2=80=99=
t see how the charge of transactional views is a valid criticism. It depend=
s on the transaction.&nbsp; I do think that any President at this point wou=
ld be viewing that the geopolitical system we have had is now obsolete.&nbs=
p; If Russia could not conquer Ukraine in 3 years, it certainly can=E2=80=
=99t invade Europe. Therefore the purpose of NATO is obsolete both in terms=
 of Europe=E2=80=99s vast economic recovery, and Russia=E2=80=99s military =
decline. The logic of the Cold war no longer holds.&nbsp; But since the Eur=
opeans liked the prior American solicitude, with good reason, they see the =
US shift as reckless. But 80 years for a geopolitical system to remain unch=
anged is extraordinary.&nbsp; Sophisticated people have trouble, having ada=
pted to a norm, understanding the norm=E2=80=99s obsolescence. It takes a l=
ack of sophistication to see the obvious. God knows that Trump appears unso=
phisticated, but there is power in recognizing obsolescence of cultural and=
 geopolitical norms. I think any other president at this moment in history =
would be doing the same thing, albeit more gracefully.&nbsp; However is bre=
aking the norm possible without bad manners?<br>
<br>
<strong>Re-engineering comments:</strong><em> (these are very close to the =
original emails text)</em><br>
<br>
Engineering analogy: &nbsp;Think of President Donald Trump's recent actions=
 as building a bridge to cross a river. &nbsp;A blueprint for redefining th=
e system must be designed, though the outcome of Trump's initial actions is=
 uncertain, even if their intent seems clear. Wise Engineering would procee=
d with a much more deliberate&nbsp;plan with a clear way forward at a measu=
red pace. Trump=E2=80=99s approach results in chaos and distrust of making =
agreements with the US.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to make blue&nbsp; prints in geopolitics. In engineering th=
e blueprints are frequently revised as they encounter new realities.&nbsp; =
Engineering is the craft of designing things that work, and the initial blu=
eprint is frequently revised and sometimes abandoned for a new one.&nbsp; B=
lueprints are drawn up when reality requires a new building, but the bluepr=
ints are rarely the final word. I think Trump=E2=80=99s blue print is to fi=
rst tear down the building see what is left, and innovate in rebuilding.&nb=
sp; We will see if it works.&nbsp; However a blueprint is frequently a fant=
asy that traps engineers in failure.&nbsp; There is something to be said fo=
r engineering an intent into reality without committing to an overall plan.=
 But then I am far from a handyman around the house and my&nbsp; wife won=
=E2=80=99t let me hold a hammer.<br>
<br>
Additional considerations for re-engineering will have to take into account=
 that:<br>
<br>
- Europeans will remain wary of a Russian resurgence, whatever Russia's cur=
rent weakness<br>
- the US derives significant wealth from its imperium (it's an economic one=
), and its domestic stability (as well as the wealth of its wealthiest) dep=
ends on the availability of cheap products for an underpaid and to some ext=
ent government supported workforce. Looks like this is going to be tested s=
oon.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Europeans have a prior problem. In the 80 years since the war the Europ=
eans are still the discrete nations that they were for centuries, centuries=
 in which they waged the bloodiest wars imaginable against each other. The =
European have not evolved into a single federal nation, but engage in thing=
s like the European Union and Nato in lieu of becoming a nation state, with=
 a European government that can wage war. Europe has vast economic resource=
s for defense, but its geopolitical condition remains the same as it was wh=
en Europe tore itself to bits.&nbsp; This was prevented by the American pre=
sence, but during that time the Europeans failed to build the kind of insti=
tutions that would bind them together against a Russian threat, which is in=
 my mind much diminished, and was never quite as credible as the US thought=
, but we overreact which is not a bad thing.<br>
<br>
However, after 80 years there is no such thing as a European army or a Euro=
pean foreign policy. Each nation is sovereign and few act in concert.&nbsp;=
 There is now growing tension between France and Germany, nothing dangerous=
 but not something that should be possible now. I served in Europe in the 1=
970s when European anti-Americanism was at a peak. It was not pleasant and =
I was born in Europe.&nbsp; So the problem of Europe is not that it could n=
ot easily repel a Russian invasion, it is that Europe is the name of a cont=
inent and not a nation, and they have failed to create a European nation. A=
t the moment, there is no real threat from Russia and for the Europeans you=
 don=E2=80=99t fix the roof when it doesn=E2=80=99t rain because there is n=
o leak, and then don=E2=80=99t fix it when it does because it is raining. T=
he United States spent two world wars and eighty years dealing with Europe=
=E2=80=99s disease. When I was an American in Paris I was not an honored gu=
est but an imperialist occupier. Of course I was hanging around the Sorbonn=
e hoping for a date.&nbsp; As a European whose parents had been in German c=
oncentration camps, and who had to flee the communists in Hungary when I wa=
s an infant, then later served there and frequently visit, I find the Europ=
eans to be unwilling, not unable, to defend themselves. I don=E2=80=99t wan=
t my grandchildren to compensate for their irresponsibility.&nbsp; But that=
 is less geopolitical analysis than very satisfying venting.<br>
<br>
I hope this mode of answering questions works for you.&nbsp; And I hope tha=
t those of you offended by my answers understand that counter to my staff=
=E2=80=99s belief, I am human, and in writing to you in this context I am p=
repared to reveal some personal feelings.<br>
<br>
To emphasize, I read every email you send and welcome this way to respond.&=
nbsp; I hope it is of value to you as well.&nbsp; See you next week.<br>
