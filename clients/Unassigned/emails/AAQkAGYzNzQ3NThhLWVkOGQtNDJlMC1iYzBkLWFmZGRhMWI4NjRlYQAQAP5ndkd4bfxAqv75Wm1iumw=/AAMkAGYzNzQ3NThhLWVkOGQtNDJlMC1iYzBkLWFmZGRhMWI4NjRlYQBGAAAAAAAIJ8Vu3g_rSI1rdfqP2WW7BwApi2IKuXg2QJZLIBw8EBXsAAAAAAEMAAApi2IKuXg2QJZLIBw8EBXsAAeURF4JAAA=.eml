=E2=80=9CNate, I can=E2=80=99t use these fancy models. The company won=E2=
=80=99t pay for it.=E2=80=9D
I hear that a lot.
And I=E2=80=99m really tired of it.=20
So I made this post for you and your manager and the IT department.
Here=E2=80=99s exactly why the best companies on the planet are blowing out=
 traditional software budgets to equip their teams with AI costing hundreds=
 a month.
Here=E2=80=99s the ROI case for doing that at work, and here=E2=80=99s my p=
ersonal plea to management to invest in the best models out there.=20
And most of all, here=E2=80=99s how to do it right:
Case studies from companies leaning in on AI investments
A guide for building your own business case
Sector-by-sector productivity gains from AI tooling
Detailed implementation guides for getting better tooling operational
It=E2=80=99s everything you need to make the case for better AI tooling, wh=
ether you=E2=80=99re a professional or a manager or a leader.=20
The bottom line is simple: it makes zero sense to wait on tackling AI tooli=
ng upgrades. Yes, waiting will cost you technically. But the real reason no=
t to wait is people: your best people will absolutely walk away if they can=
=E2=80=99t get the tooling that helps them accelerate.=20
I know, because they talk to me about it.=20
PS. This would normally be an executive circle post, but I=E2=80=99m circul=
ating it to all paid members since I think AI professionals at all levels s=
hould be armed with this info to make the case for better tooling (you can =
learn more about my plans here [ https://substack.com/redirect/442418f8-d40=
a-4c15-8754-fc22e0041b3d?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDn=

Managers Are Breaking AI Budgets (And It=E2=80=99s Going to Cost You Your B=
est People)
I need to be honest about something uncomfortable: managers are systematica=
lly losing their best people because they can=E2=80=99t adapt budget proces=
ses fast enough for AI tools. I say this as someone who has managed teams, =
with full sympathy for the challenges we=E2=80=99re all facing. But the dat=
a is overwhelming, and the consequences are already here.
Enterprise AI spending jumped 75% year-over-year in 2024, reaching $400,000=
 annually per organization for AI-native applications alone. Yet I=E2=80=99=
ve talked to hundreds of individual contributors over the past year, and th=
e complaint is nearly universal. They want access to AI tools that meaningf=
ully improve their work=E2=80=94tools that can double productivity in conte=
nt creation and data analysis. And they can=E2=80=99t get them, blocked not=
 by technical limitations, but by budget processes designed for a different=
 era.
The frustration plays out identically every time. Managers tell me they can=
=E2=80=99t go to IT because security will raise objections. They can=E2=80=
=99t go to their bosses because department heads balk at $200-500 per emplo=
yee per month for software=E2=80=94numbers unprecedented in traditional sof=
tware budgeting. So managers kick the can down the road, thinking they=E2=
=80=99ll figure it out next fiscal year.
Here=E2=80=99s the problem: it=E2=80=99s not getting cheaper. By 2026-2027,=
 expect comprehensive AI tools to cost $1,000-2,000 per employee monthly as=
 models become more sophisticated and computational requirements increase. =
And here=E2=80=99s why that matters more than you think.
Why Traditional Software Budgeting Is Dead
Traditional software budgeting assumes marginal improvements at marginal co=
sts. A typical enterprise tool costs $10-50 per user monthly. But AI tools =
operate in a completely different economic paradigm=E2=80=94comprehensive A=
I suites now range from $200-500 per employee monthly, with advanced enterp=
rise implementations reaching $2,000-2,500 monthly.
This isn=E2=80=99t software inflation. It=E2=80=99s a category shift. Micro=
soft Copilot at $30 per month pays for itself if it saves just 2-3 hours mo=
nthly for a $100,000 employee. That=E2=80=99s the calculation that changes =
everything: AI software pricing now competes against human compensation, no=
t other software tools. When a $400 monthly AI subscription can replace 10-=
20 hours of manual work, the value proposition remains compelling even as p=
rices rise.
Software costs have already grown from 13% of total IT budgets in 2019 to 2=
1% in 2024, with AI features driving much of this increase. Nearly half of =
organizations experienced licensing cost increases exceeding the industry a=
verage of 10%, as vendors systematically add AI capabilities to justify pri=
ce increases.
The enterprise AI market exploded from $24 billion in 2024 to a projected $=
150 billion by 2030=E2=80=94a 35% compound annual growth rate. This isn=E2=
=80=99t gradual software evolution. It=E2=80=99s comparable to the transiti=
on from mainframes to personal computers, and your budget process wasn=E2=
=80=99t designed for it.
The Talent Retention Crisis You Can=E2=80=99t Afford
Here=E2=80=99s the math that should terrify every manager operating under t=
raditional budget constraints: the cost of employee turnover ranges from 50=
-200% of annual salary. For a $100,000 employee, turnover costs between $50=
,000-200,000. Comprehensive AI tools cost $4,800 annually. A single retaine=
d employee pays for 10-40 colleagues=E2=80=99 AI subscriptions.
The competition for AI-skilled talent has reached unprecedented intensity. =
Demand for AI skills grew 292% in 2024. Elite AI companies like Anthropic m=
aintain 80% retention rates, compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta=E2=
=80=94largely because they provide cutting-edge tools and autonomy.
The brain drain from traditional companies is accelerating. Meta ranked as =
the second-most targeted company for AI talent poaching in 2024, with 4.3% =
of new AI lab hires coming from the organization. At least nine research sc=
ientists moved directly from Meta to the AI startup Mistral since April 202=
3. Microsoft compiled lists of Meta=E2=80=99s most sought-after engineers t=
o match competitive offers.
Notice the pattern: top AI talent gravitates toward organizations that prov=
ide modern tooling and technical autonomy. Companies restricting AI tool ac=
cess because of budget constraints are systematically losing their best per=
formers to competitors who understand the new economic reality.
The Shadow AI Problem Nobody=E2=80=99s Tracking
Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s already happening in your organization, and t=
he numbers are more alarming than you think. 50% of employees now use Shado=
w AI=E2=80=94unauthorized AI tools they=E2=80=99ve purchased themselves or =
access through free accounts. But here=E2=80=99s the kicker: 46% of employe=
es say they would refuse to give up their personal AI tools even if banned =
by their organization.
The governance gap is massive. Only 14% of organizations have clear AI secu=
rity policies, yet 84% of AI tools have been breached. Meanwhile, 57% of em=
ployees actively hide their AI use at work, and 25% of employees input sens=
itive data into AI tools without oversight. Most telling: 58% of IT manager=
s themselves use unapproved AI tools=E2=80=94even the people responsible fo=
r governance are going around the system.
The micro-transaction nature of AI subscriptions bypasses traditional procu=
rement oversight. Many AI tools cost $20-30 monthly, falling below the $5,0=
00 threshold that triggers formal IT review. 65% of enterprise SaaS apps ar=
e unsanctioned, with 65% of remote workers using non-approved tools. Direct=
ors can procure AI tools for entire teams without appearing on procurement =
radar, creating accountability gaps that traditional budget processes weren=
=E2=80=99t designed to handle.
Security concerns, while legitimate, are often used to justify inaction rat=
her than drive appropriate governance. 67% of organizations plan to increas=
e AI security spending, but many use security reviews as delaying tactics. =
The result: employees either work without necessary tools or use unauthoriz=
ed alternatives that create greater security risks than managed deployment =
would.
What Success Actually Looks Like
The organizations getting this right aren=E2=80=99t waiting for perfect pro=
cesses. They=E2=80=99re moving fast, measuring outcomes, and demonstrating =
ROI with real numbers:
Contraktor (legal tech) reduced contract analysis time by 75%, achieving 4-=
5X faster processing and cutting legal review costs by three-quarters.
Sojern (travel marketing) compressed audience generation from 2 weeks to 2 =
days=E2=80=94an 86% reduction=E2=80=94while improving cost-per-acquisition =
by 20-50%.
Galaxies (marketing analytics) cut campaign testing from months to 48 hours=
, achieving 85% savings in direct research costs.
Hiscox (insurance) reduced underwriting time from 3 days to minutes=E2=80=
=94a 95% reduction that transformed their competitive position.
These aren=E2=80=99t marginal improvements. They=E2=80=99re fundamental tra=
nsformations in how work gets done, and they=E2=80=99re happening right now=
 at organizations that figured out how to say =E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D instead=
 of =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99ll review this next quarter.=E2=80=9D
The Industry Reality: One Size Doesn=E2=80=99t Fit All
The productivity gains and ROI timelines vary dramatically by industry, and=
 understanding this helps set realistic expectations:
Technology: 45% productivity gains, 2-month ROI timeline ($500/employee/mon=
th)
Professional Services: 40% gains, 3-month ROI ($250/employee/month)
Manufacturing: 35% gains, 4-month ROI ($350/employee/month)=20
Financial Services: 30% gains, 6-month ROI ($400/employee/month)=20
Healthcare: 25% gains, 8-month ROI ($300/employee/month)
Healthcare=E2=80=99s longer timeline reflects HIPAA compliance requirements=
 and patient privacy protocols. Financial services faces regulatory complia=
nce challenges. Manufacturing must integrate with legacy systems. But every=
 industry shows positive ROI=E2=80=94the question is just how quickly you=
=E2=80=99ll realize it, not whether you will.
If your organization operates in a highly regulated industry, don=E2=80=99t=
 let that become an excuse for inaction. It means you need stronger governa=
nce, not indefinite delay.=20
Wondering where I got the numbers? These benchmarks are supported by (1) Mc=
Kinsey, PwC, and Stanford HAI data showing sectoral differences in AI adopt=
ion, (2) industry surveys and pilot outcomes published in sources like the =
Stanford 2025 AI Index Report, Wharton=E2=80=99s projected impact analysis,=
 and Mordor Intelligence=E2=80=99s enterprise AI market size and case study=
 reviews, and (3) pricing models reported across major sectors.
What Your Employees Actually Need
Look at this from the perspective of an individual contributor trying to bu=
ild a career right now. It has never been more challenging to figure out a =
path forward. They need to build AI skills. They need to deliver in their c=
urrent role using rapidly evolving tools. They need to set up their resume =
for a world where job descriptions change every quarter.
They need these tools to show their current employer they can deliver value=
=2E They need these tools to demonstrat=
e capability when they look for promot=
ion or their next role. They need these tools to stay competitive in a mark=
et where the best companies already require AI fluency. And by and large, w=
e=E2=80=99re not setting them up for success.
The really good ones vote with their feet. People who are exceptional at us=
ing AI move to roles and companies that understand this shift. They won=E2=
=80=99t stay at organizations that treat AI like a nice-to-have. This isn=
=E2=80=99t about compensation alone=E2=80=94people left Meta after $100 mil=
lion packages because they didn=E2=80=99t like the culture. It=E2=80=99s ab=
out whether your business generates the kind of environment where your best=
 people feel they can actually thrive.
The Financial Reality Leadership Needs to Understand
Let=E2=80=99s make this concrete with numbers you can take to your next bud=
get meeting. For a typical $100,000 employee using $400/month AI tools:
AI tools cost: $4,800 annually
Productivity gain: 25% improvement (10 hours saved monthly)
Value of time saved: $7,500 annually
Net benefit: $2,700 positive annual return
ROI: 56% return on investment
Payback period: 7.7 months
That=E2=80=99s using conservative assumptions. Technology teams often see 4=
5% productivity gains with 2-month payback. Professional services teams fre=
quently hit 40% gains with 3-month payback. Even healthcare, with its compl=
ex compliance requirements, achieves 25% gains within 8 months.
Organizations that successfully adapt their procurement and budgeting proce=
sses gain enormous competitive advantages. Companies implementing AI tools =
effectively see 30-40% productivity gains in knowledge work, while those st=
uck in traditional processes watch their best talent leave for more forward=
-thinking competitors.
The financial impact of getting this wrong is severe. Organizations experie=
nce 30% higher turnover costs when they fail to provide modern tooling, whi=
le replacement costs for AI-skilled employees can reach $200,000 or more pe=
r departure. The math is unforgiving: a $50,000 annual AI tool budget per e=
mployee costs less than losing that employee once every four years.
Early adopters are already seeing results. Salesforce closed 5,000 Agentfor=
ce deals since October 2024, including 3,000 paid customers, demonstrating =
real market demand for comprehensive AI platforms. Organizations using outc=
ome-based pricing models report better alignment between costs and value de=
livered.
What Managers Need to Do Now
Senior managers and directors need to carry the flag on this. You need to e=
xplain clearly to your bosses and to IT why traditional software budgeting =
doesn=E2=80=99t work anymore. Here=E2=80=99s how:
1. Reframe the comparison. Stop comparing AI tools to software subscription=
s. Compare them to human compensation and turnover costs. A $6,000 annual A=
I tool investment that prevents one $150,000 turnover is a 25x ROI.
2. Use specific numbers. Don=E2=80=99t say =E2=80=9CAI will make us more pr=
oductive.=E2=80=9D Say =E2=80=9CMicrosoft Copilot saves 2-3 hours per week =
for knowledge workers. For our team of 20 at $100,000 average compensation,=
 that=E2=80=99s $96,000-144,000 in productivity value annually for a $7,200=
 total investment.=E2=80=9D
3. Address security proactively. Create a fast-track approval process for t=
ools below defined risk thresholds while maintaining appropriate governance=
=2E Don=E2=80=99t let security reviews bec=
ome indefinite delays. The Shadow A=
I statistics show that delayed approval doesn=E2=80=99t prevent usage=E2=80=
=94it just prevents oversight.
4. Prepare for the price trajectory. Build 2026-2027 budgets assuming $1,00=
0-2,000 per employee monthly for comprehensive AI tools. If you wait until =
prices rise to adjust budgets, you=E2=80=99ll be two years behind.
5. Measure retention by tool access. Track whether employees with modern AI=
 tool access have different retention rates than those without. The data wi=
ll justify the investment.
Your teams need to tell you what tools they actually need. You need to expl=
ain to leadership what those tools enable=E2=80=94not in vague terms about =
innovation, but with specific use cases and concrete productivity metrics.
The Implementation Sequence That Works
Successful organizations follow a clear sequence, though the timeline varie=
s based on organization size and complexity. Here=E2=80=99s what actually w=
orks, phase by phase, with the context you need to avoid the traps that kil=
l 88% of AI pilots before they reach production.
Foundation Phase: Know What You=E2=80=99re Actually Dealing With
Most organizations start by debating which AI tool to buy. That=E2=80=99s b=
ackwards. You need to understand what=E2=80=99s already happening before yo=
u make any decisions.
Conduct a Shadow AI audit - Your employees are already using AI tools. You =
just don=E2=80=99t know which ones or how. Start by discovering the reality=
 on the ground:
Survey your organization: =E2=80=9CWhat AI tools are you currently using fo=
r work, whether approved or not?=E2=80=9D Make it anonymous. Make it clear =
this isn=E2=80=99t a witch hunt - you=E2=80=99re trying to help, not punish=
=2E
Check your expense reports for $20-50 monthly subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus=
, Claude Pro, Midjourney, Jasper, Copy.ai, or similar tools.
Talk to your IT team about which AI domains are being accessed from corpora=
te networks.
Interview your top performers individually. They=E2=80=99re the ones most l=
ikely to have found tools that work.
What you=E2=80=99re looking for: Which tools are people actually finding va=
luable enough to pay for themselves? What use cases are they solving? Where=
 are the biggest productivity gains happening?
This audit typically reveals that 50-65% of your employees are already usin=
g unauthorized AI tools, and the most productive people are the ones using =
them most. That=E2=80=99s your roadmap - you=E2=80=99re not starting from z=
ero, you=E2=80=99re catching up to what your best people already figured ou=
t.
Secure executive sponsorship and budget allocation - You cannot do this bot=
tom-up. AI tools require budget categories that don=E2=80=99t exist in trad=
itional software planning, and middle managers don=E2=80=99t have the autho=
rity to create them.
You need a specific executive sponsor who will:
Commit to budget allocation in the $200-500 per employee per month range fo=
r initial deployment
Override the =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99ll evaluate this next quarter=E2=80=9D ins=
tinct when security raises concerns
Defend the investment when other department heads ask why your software bud=
get is 10x theirs
Make clear this is strategic priority, not a skunkworks experiment
The pitch to executives: =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re already spending this money=
 through Shadow AI. We=E2=80=99re just spending it without governance, with=
out security oversight, and without capturing the organizational learning. =
And we=E2=80=99re about to lose our best people to competitors who figured =
this out.=E2=80=9D
Bring three numbers: current turnover cost for key roles, estimated Shadow =
AI spend (if 50% of employees spend $30/month, that=E2=80=99s already $15/e=
mployee/month with zero oversight), and productivity gains from the audit i=
nterviews.
Form a cross-functional team - This cannot be an IT-only project, and it ca=
nnot be a business-unit-only project. You need:
Business unit representative who deeply understands the work and can identi=
fy high-value use cases
IT representative who can evaluate technical integration and infrastructure=
 requirements
Security representative who can define risk thresholds and governance requi=
rements (not veto everything, but establish guardrails)
Finance representative who can track costs and measure ROI in ways your CFO=
 will accept
HR representative (for larger implementations) who can address training, ch=
ange management, and retention implications
The team should be small (5-7 people maximum) and have explicit decision-ma=
king authority. If this becomes a 15-person committee that needs three appr=
oval layers, you=E2=80=99ve already failed.
Define the team=E2=80=99s mandate clearly: =E2=80=9CImplement AI tools that=
 demonstrably improve productivity within [your timeline], with appropriate=
 security and governance, and prove ROI sufficient to justify broader deplo=
yment.=E2=80=9D
Assessment & Selection Phase: Stop Evaluating Generic Features
The failure mode here is spending three months creating elaborate capabilit=
y matrices comparing 47 AI tools across 200 features. Nobody cares if a too=
l has a 4.7 vs 4.8 rating on G2. You care if it solves your specific proble=
ms.
Identify priority use cases based on impact and feasibility - Start with th=
e problems that are:
High-impact (hours of work per week, or quality issues that are expensive)
High-frequency (happening daily or weekly, not quarterly)
Already being solved by Shadow AI (your audit revealed this)
Measurable (you can tell if it=E2=80=99s working or not)
Good use cases:
=E2=80=9COur sales team spends 6 hours per week writing proposal responses =
that are 80% similar to previous proposals=E2=80=9D (High impact, high freq=
uency, measurable)
=E2=80=9CCustomer support takes 45 minutes per ticket because they have to =
search through 15 different knowledge bases=E2=80=9D (High impact, high fre=
quency, measurable)
=E2=80=9CEngineers spend 4 hours per week writing documentation that=E2=80=
=99s often incomplete or out of date=E2=80=9D (High impact, high frequency,=
 measurable)
Bad use cases:
=E2=80=9CWe want to be more innovative=E2=80=9D (Not measurable, not specif=
ic)
=E2=80=9CAI will help us make better strategic decisions=E2=80=9D (Not high=
-frequency, not measurable)
=E2=80=9CWe should automate everything=E2=80=9D (Not focused, not realistic=
)
Prioritize 2-3 use cases maximum for the pilot. You=E2=80=99re proving the =
model works, not solving every problem at once.
Define security requirements and compliance constraints - This is where mos=
t implementations die. Security becomes a veto, not a framework.
Instead of asking =E2=80=9CIs this tool secure?=E2=80=9D (answer is always =
=E2=80=9Cnot secure enough=E2=80=9D), ask:
=E2=80=9CWhat data classification levels are we working with?=E2=80=9D (Pub=
lic, internal, confidential, regulated)
=E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s our acceptable risk threshold for each classificati=
on?=E2=80=9D (Some data can go to cloud AI, some can=E2=80=99t)
=E2=80=9CWhat governance controls do we need?=E2=80=9D (Audit logging, data=
 retention policies, access controls)
=E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s our compliance boundary?=E2=80=9D (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR=
, etc.)
Create a decision matrix:
Green zone: Public data, general business content =E2=86=92 Can use cloud A=
I tools with standard terms
Yellow zone: Internal data, no PII/regulated data =E2=86=92 Can use cloud A=
I with specific contractual protections (data not used for training, encryp=
tion, access controls)
Red zone: Regulated data, PII, trade secrets =E2=86=92 Cannot use cloud AI,=
 needs on-premise or specifically compliant solutions
Most use cases fall into green or yellow zones. If your organization treats=
 everything as red zone, you=E2=80=99re creating security theater, not secu=
rity.
The right answer is usually: =E2=80=9CWe can use ChatGPT Team/Claude Team f=
or 80% of use cases with appropriate policies. We need specialized solution=
s for the 20% that involves regulated data.=E2=80=9D
Evaluate tools against specific business needs - Now that you know your use=
 cases and security requirements, evaluate tools by actually using them for=
 real work.
Don=E2=80=99t evaluate based on:
Feature lists in marketing materials
Analyst reports ranking =E2=80=9CAI capabilities=E2=80=9D
Demos with perfect example data
Do evaluate based on:
Three real examples from your priority use cases. Does the tool solve them?
How long does it take to get value? (Good tools work immediately, bad tools=
 need weeks of configuration)
What=E2=80=99s the learning curve for your actual users? (Have real users t=
ry them, not just the evaluation team)
What=E2=80=99s the total cost including integration, training, and ongoing =
management?
Run this evaluation in parallel with 2-3 tools maximum. It should take 1-2 =
weeks, not months. You=E2=80=99re looking for =E2=80=9Cclearly solves our p=
roblem=E2=80=9D vs =E2=80=9Cdoesn=E2=80=99t work for us,=E2=80=9D not optim=
izing for 5% better performance.
Security & Planning Phase: Governance That Enables, Not Blocks
Complete IT security review and compliance checks - Security review should =
take days to weeks, not months to quarters. If your security review has bee=
n running for 90+ days, security is being used as a blocking mechanism, not=
 a risk management mechanism.
The security review should answer:
Where is data stored and who has access? (Specific controls, not general co=
ncerns)
What data processing agreements are in place? (Can you get appropriate cont=
ractual protections?)
What audit logging and monitoring exists? (Can you detect misuse?)
What=E2=80=99s the incident response process if there=E2=80=99s a breach? (=
Specific plan, not =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99ll figure it out=E2=80=9D)
Does this meet our compliance requirements? (Specific regulations, specific=
 controls)
For most cloud AI tools (ChatGPT Team, Claude Team, Microsoft Copilot), the=
 answers are:
Data stored in vendor cloud with encryption at rest and in transit
Business terms explicitly state data is not used for training
Audit logging available for enterprise plans
Vendor incident response with SLAs
Meets most compliance frameworks with appropriate configuration
If security identifies risks, the question is not =E2=80=9Ccan we eliminate=
 all risk?=E2=80=9D (impossible) but =E2=80=9Cdoes the productivity benefit=
 justify the residual risk with appropriate controls?=E2=80=9D
Document the decision clearly: =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re accepting X level of =
risk for Y business benefit with Z controls in place. Approved by [executiv=
e sponsor].=E2=80=9D
Establish governance frameworks and usage policies - Create a simple, clear=
 acceptable use policy. One page, not twenty.
Good policy:
=E2=80=9CUse AI tools for work tasks that don=E2=80=99t involve customer PI=
I, regulated data, or trade secrets=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t input: customer names/emails, financial data, health=
 information, unreleased product plans, source code containing proprietary =
algorithms=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CDo use for: drafting communications, summarizing public documents,=
 brainstorming, general research, coding assistance with non-proprietary co=
de=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhen in doubt, ask [specific person/team]=E2=80=9D
Bad policy:
Twenty pages of legalese nobody reads
Vague prohibitions like =E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t put sensitive information=E2=
=80=9D (what=E2=80=99s sensitive?)
Blanket restrictions like =E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t use AI for code=E2=80=9D (=
nobody will follow this)
Make it easy to do the right thing and clear what the wrong thing is. Most =
users want to follow policy - they just need to know what it is.
Select pilot users who will champion adoption - This is critically importan=
t and commonly screwed up.
Don=E2=80=99t select pilot users who:
Are =E2=80=9Crepresentative of average employees=E2=80=9D (you need champio=
ns, not average users)
Are skeptical of AI and need to be convinced (they=E2=80=99ll find reasons =
it doesn=E2=80=99t work)
Are too busy to engage (they won=E2=80=99t use it, then will say it doesn=
=E2=80=99t work)
Do select pilot users who:
Are already using Shadow AI or are enthusiastic about trying it
Are respected by their peers (their testimonials matter)
Have genuine productivity pain points the tool should solve
Will give honest feedback, not just positive feedback
Have time to learn and iterate
Aim for 10-30 pilot users for a small organization, 50-100 for a large orga=
nization. Big enough to get meaningful data, small enough to support well.
Tell them explicitly: =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re helping us figure this out. W=
e want honest feedback about what works and what doesn=E2=80=99t. Your job =
is to use this for real work and tell us what happens.=E2=80=9D
Pilot Phase: Learn Fast, Measure Everything
Deploy tools to pilot group with clear success metrics - Don=E2=80=99t just=
 give people access and hope for the best. Set up the pilot for success.
Define success metrics before you start:
Specific time savings: =E2=80=9CReduce proposal writing time from 6 hours t=
o 2 hours per proposal=E2=80=9D
Quality improvements: =E2=80=9CReduce documentation errors from 15% to unde=
r 5%=E2=80=9D
User satisfaction: =E2=80=9C80% of pilot users rate the tool as valuable or=
 very valuable=E2=80=9D
Usage metrics: =E2=80=9CPilot users actively use tools at least 3x per week=
=E2=80=9D
Make the tools as easy to use as possible:
Pre-configure accounts for pilot users (don=E2=80=99t make them figure out =
procurement)
Provide clear documentation on how to access and start using tools
Create templates or examples for common use cases
Set up a quick-response support channel (Slack channel, email, whatever wor=
ks)
Track both quantitative metrics (time saved, usage frequency) and qualitati=
ve feedback (what=E2=80=99s working, what=E2=80=99s not, what=E2=80=99s sur=
prising).
Provide training focused on specific use cases - Don=E2=80=99t do generic =
=E2=80=9CAI 101=E2=80=9D training. Do specific =E2=80=9Chere=E2=80=99s how =
to solve your actual problems=E2=80=9D training.
Bad training:
2-hour presentation on =E2=80=9CWhat AI is and how it works=E2=80=9D
Generic examples that aren=E2=80=99t relevant to real work
Focus on features and capabilities rather than outcomes
One-and-done training session with no follow-up
Good training:
30-minute sessions focused on specific use cases: =E2=80=9CHow to use AI fo=
r proposal writing,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CHow to use AI for customer support,=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CHow to use AI for code documentation=E2=80=9D
Live demonstrations using real work examples from your organization
Hands-on practice with immediate feedback
Follow-up sessions after 1-2 weeks to address questions and share learnings
The best training is often peer-to-peer: have early successful users show o=
thers what they=E2=80=99re doing. People trust their colleagues more than t=
raining materials.
Track usage patterns and collect feedback continuously - Set up weekly chec=
k-ins with pilot users for the first month, then bi-weekly.
Ask specific questions:
=E2=80=9CWhat have you used the tool for this week?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat worked well?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat didn=E2=80=99t work or was frustrating?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat would you try if you knew how?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CAre you saving time? How much?=E2=80=9D
Watch for patterns:
Are specific use cases working better than others?
Are certain users getting much more value than others? (Why?)
Are there common obstacles or frustrations?
Are people finding use cases you didn=E2=80=99t anticipate?
Don=E2=80=99t wait until the end of the pilot to discover it=E2=80=99s not =
working. You should know within 2-3 weeks if people are getting value, and =
if not, you need to understand why and adjust.
Measurement Phase: Prove It With Numbers
Measure productivity gains with concrete metrics - This is where most organ=
izations fail. They deploy tools, people use them, but nobody can prove ROI=
 because they didn=E2=80=99t measure properly.
Measure before the pilot:
Baseline time for key tasks (how long does proposal writing take now?)
Baseline quality metrics (what=E2=80=99s our error rate in documentation no=
w?)
Current costs (what are we spending on this activity now?)
Measure during and after the pilot:
Time per task with AI tools
Quality metrics with AI tools
User-reported time savings (survey weekly)
Usage frequency (how often are they actually using it?)
Get specific user stories with numbers:
=E2=80=9CSarah used to spend 5 hours writing proposals. Now she spends 2 ho=
urs and uses AI to generate first drafts. She=E2=80=99s completing 50% more=
 proposals per week.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThe support team=E2=80=99s average ticket resolution time dropped =
from 45 minutes to 28 minutes, a 38% improvement.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CDocumentation error rate dropped from 18% to 7% after engineers st=
arted using AI to check their work.=E2=80=9D
These stories are more valuable than aggregate statistics for making your c=
ase.
Track costs against budget and compare to expected ROI - Be honest about to=
tal costs:
Tool subscription costs (obvious)
Implementation time (how many hours did IT spend setting this up?)
Training time (hours spent training pilot users)
Management overhead (ongoing support and governance)
Compare total costs to demonstrated value:
Time savings =C3=97 employee cost per hour =3D productivity value
Error reduction =C3=97 cost of errors =3D quality value
User satisfaction =E2=86=92 retention impact (harder to quantify but real)
Example:
Pilot: 30 users at $400/month =3D $12,000/month =3D $144,000/year
Time savings: 8 hours/month average =3D 240 hours/month across 30 users
Value at $50/hour fully loaded =3D $12,000/month =3D $144,000/year
Net: Break-even in year 1, positive ROI as you scale

Pilot size: 12 sales team members, 6 weeks
Tool cost: $360/month total
Time savings: Average 3.2 hours per proposal (was 6 hours, now 2.8 hours)
Proposals completed: 47% increase (team completed 88 proposals vs. 60 in pr=
ior 6-week period)
Quality: Client feedback scores unchanged at 4.2/5 (maintained quality whil=
e increasing speed)
User satisfaction: 11 of 12 users rate tool as =E2=80=98valuable=E2=80=99 o=
r =E2=80=98very valuable=E2=80=99
ROI: $18,000 value for $2,160 cost =3D 733% ROI
Quote from user: =E2=80=98I can now focus on customizing proposals instead =
of starting from scratch every time. I=E2=80=99m closing more deals because=
 I can respond faster.=E2=80=99 - Sarah Chen, Senior Sales Rep=E2=80=9D
Create 2-3 of these case studies from your pilot. They=E2=80=99re worth mor=
e than any generic AI presentation.
Scaling Phase: Expand What Works, Not What Doesn=E2=80=99t
Develop scaling plan based on pilot results - Don=E2=80=99t just say =E2=80=
=9Clet=E2=80=99s roll this out to everyone.=E2=80=9D Scale methodically bas=
ed on what you learned.
Review pilot results honestly:
Which use cases showed clear ROI? (Scale these first)
Which use cases didn=E2=80=99t work? (Understand why before scaling - maybe=
 wrong tool, maybe wrong use case, maybe need different approach)
Which user groups got the most value? (Similar roles should be next to scal=
e)
What obstacles did users face? (Fix these before scaling)
Create a phased scaling plan:
Phase 1: Expand to similar roles/use cases where pilot was successful (next=
 90 days)
Phase 2: Expand to adjacent use cases with similar characteristics (next 18=
0 days)
Phase 3: Expand to remaining organization with appropriate tools per use ca=
se (next 360 days)
Don=E2=80=99t try to scale everything at once. Scale what=E2=80=99s working=
, learn from it, then scale more.
Identify additional use cases and user groups - Your pilot revealed new use=
 cases you didn=E2=80=99t anticipate. Some will be valuable, some won=E2=80=
=99t.
Evaluate new use cases with same criteria:
High impact =C3=97 high frequency =C3=97 measurable =3D good candidate
Already happening via Shadow AI =3D proven demand
Similar to successful pilot use cases =3D likely to work
Prioritize user groups for scaling:
Groups most similar to successful pilot users (same roles, same problems)
Groups with highest demonstrated need (they=E2=80=99re asking for access)
Groups where productivity gains have biggest business impact
Get approval and funding for broader deployment - Go back to your executive=
 sponsor with pilot results.
Present:
Clear ROI from pilot with specific numbers
User testimonials from respected employees
Scaling plan with expected costs and expected returns
Risk assessment based on actual pilot experience (not theoretical concerns)
Ask for specific budget allocation:
=E2=80=9CWe need $X per month to scale to Y additional users over Z timelin=
e=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CExpected ROI based on pilot is A%, with B-month payback=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThis prevents C employees from leaving for competitors with modern=
 tools=E2=80=9D
Make it easy to say yes. You=E2=80=99ve proven the model works. Now you=E2=
=80=99re asking to scale what works.
Optimization Phase: Make It Sustainable
Calculate and communicate ROI to stakeholders - Create a regular reporting =
cadence (monthly or quarterly) showing:
Current usage: X% of target users actively using tools Y times per week
Measured productivity gains: Z hours saved per user per month =3D $A value
Cost tracking: Spending $B per month as planned, or adjusted based on actua=
lity
User satisfaction: C% of users rate tools as valuable
Example success stories: Specific users/teams achieving specific results
Keep reports concise - one page with key metrics and 2-3 success stories. E=
xecutives don=E2=80=99t need 20 slides, they need clear evidence it=E2=80=
=99s working.
Establish regular measurement and reporting cadence - Make measurement ongo=
ing, not one-time:
Automate usage tracking where possible (tool analytics, license usage)
Survey users quarterly about value and satisfaction
Collect new success stories continuously
Track retention metrics for users with AI tools vs. without
Create a feedback loop: measurement =E2=86=92 learning =E2=86=92 improvemen=
t =E2=86=92 measurement.
Plan next phase investments based on demonstrated value - Use your success =
to justify continued investment:
If productivity gains exceed expectations, accelerate scaling
If certain use cases show exceptional ROI, prioritize similar use cases
If new tools become available that solve current limitations, pilot them us=
ing same process
If costs are increasing as predicted, get ahead of budget planning cycle
The goal is to move from =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re experimenting with AI=E2=80=
=9D to =E2=80=9Cwe have systematic AI enablement as part of how we work.=E2=
=80=9D
The key principle underlying all of this: move as fast as your organization=
=E2=80=99s risk tolerance allows, but don=E2=80=99t skip the measurement st=
eps. The failure mode isn=E2=80=99t moving too fast - it=E2=80=99s getting =
stuck in permanent pilot mode because you can=E2=80=99t demonstrate value w=
ithout measuring it, and you can=E2=80=99t measure without clear metrics fr=
om the start.
Organizations that execute this sequence typically move from kickoff to sca=
led deployment in 3-9 months, depending on size and complexity. Organizatio=
ns that skip steps or let any phase drag on indefinitely usually fail to sc=
ale at all, and their best people leave for companies that figured it out.
The Stakes
This is not about keeping up with trends. It=E2=80=99s about whether your o=
rganization can compete. Companies that figure out their legacy procurement=
 processes are actively hurting their ability to enable great work will kic=
k those processes aside and find ways to get their teams what they need. Th=
ey=E2=80=99ll attract and retain the best AI talent. Their productivity wil=
l reflect what=E2=80=99s possible with modern tools.
Everyone else will keep using 2023 budgets for 2025 work, wondering why the=
ir best people are leaving and why their AI productivity gains are disappoi=
nting. The answer will be obvious in retrospect: you can=E2=80=99t deliver =
extraordinary results with tools you won=E2=80=99t pay for.
Take Action
If you=E2=80=99re an individual contributor: Send this to your manager with=
 specific examples of tools you need and how they=E2=80=99d improve your wo=
rk. Be concrete about the productivity gains, not abstract about =E2=80=9Cs=
taying current.=E2=80=9D If you can estimate hours saved monthly, do the RO=
I math yourself.
If you=E2=80=99re a manager: Schedule a meeting with your boss this week. B=
ring three things: (1) specific tools your team needs, (2) productivity cal=
culations showing ROI using the framework above, and (3) turnover cost anal=
ysis. Ask for a dedicated AI tools budget separate from traditional softwar=
e line items.
If you=E2=80=99re in leadership: Audit your current AI tool spending and sh=
adow AI usage. You=E2=80=99ll find your organization is already spending mo=
re than you think=E2=80=94just without governance or strategic direction. T=
he question isn=E2=80=99t whether to invest, but whether to invest strategi=
cally or let it happen chaotically.
The companies that adapt will have an enormous advantage. The ones that don=
=E2=80=99t will lose their best people to competitors who understand what=
=E2=80=99s actually at stake.
