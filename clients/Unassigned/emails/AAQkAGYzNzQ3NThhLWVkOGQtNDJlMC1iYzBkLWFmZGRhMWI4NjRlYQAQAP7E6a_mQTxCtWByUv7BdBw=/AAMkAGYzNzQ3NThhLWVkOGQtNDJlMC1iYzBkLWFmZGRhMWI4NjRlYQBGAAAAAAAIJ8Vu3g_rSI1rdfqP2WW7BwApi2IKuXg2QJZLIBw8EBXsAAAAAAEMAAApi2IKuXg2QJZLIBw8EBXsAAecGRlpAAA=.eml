WHY THE CONFLICT IN THE CONGO CAN’T STOP [3]
RENEWED PEACE EFFORTS ARE LARGELY ORNAMENTAL.
BY: RONAN WORDSWORTH
This week, the United States hosted a third round of talks to broker peace between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and M23, a rebel group that has taken over much of the mineral-rich eastern
portion of the country. The ultimate purpose of Washington’s involvement is to obtain mining licenses for critical minerals. Standing in its way is China, which maintains a dominant position in the
country and thus has reason to impede U.S. mediation efforts. Meanwhile, Rwanda – the other principal in the conflict in the Congo – benefits from the status quo. Without a major (and unlikely)
commitment of U.S. troops, there is little reason to believe the conflict will end anytime soon.
Over the past year, Qatar, the U.S., Kenya and Angola have all hosted peace talks between the Congo and M23. The group has said its end goal is to overthrow President Felix Tshisekedi, but geography
and military capability will almost certainly prevent it from doing so. Similar constraints prevent the government in Kinshasa from dislodging M23. The government alternates between negotiating and
exploiting market leverage, while M23 continues to control areas surrounding key mining zones, including Goma and Bukavu. There is no evidence to suggest the group is willing or politically able to
roll back its gains.
The situation in the Congo is hardly a local affair. As cobalt and copper become more essential to things like battery technologies, electric vehicles and high-performance jet engines, global powers
are recalibrating their strategies to secure supply chains. The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S.’s Critical Minerals Security Act of 2024 evince as much. Shoring up supply lines for
critical minerals is not just a matter of economics; over-relying on the production and refining capacity of potentially adversarial states exposes foundational (and exploitable) weakness, so it is
also a matter of national security. And because the Congo is home to 70 percent of the world's cobalt production, supplies 40 percent of its coltan, and meets around 13 percent of global copper
demand, the country has become one of the more important arenas in the competition between the U.S. and China.

Naturally, the competition complicates, and is complicated by, the conflict in the east. On Oct. 14, the government and M23 signed an agreement to create a body to monitor a ceasefire – one of two
conditions needed for formal peace talks to take place. But whatever progress this seems to convey should be taken with a grain of salt. Financially, M23 is sustained by a resource-driven war economy
and by cross-border material backing from Rwanda, with which it shares an ethnic Tutsi identity. Rwanda benefits from M23’s illicit mineral trade, while the government in Kigali supplies arms and
ammunition to M23. A military mission launched by the Southern African Development Community ended last summer, so one of the few things that actually constrained M23 is gone. A U.N. mission has also
failed to bring peace.
In light of these failures, Kinshasa has experimented with economic policies to change the status quo. It has, for example, banned cobalt exports, set new quotas and offered certain mining concessions
to attract other foreign actors. China’s copper-cobalt machine, meanwhile, has continued to operate virtually unimpeded through the partially state-owned Sicomines and CMOC, even as diplomats try
again to separate security dilemmas from supply chains. And the U.S. has become increasingly involved in an attempt to mediate in a resources-for-security transaction.
U.S. involvement has prompted China to renovate the TAZARA railway, which links eastern Congo to the Indian Ocean ports, via a $1.4 billion agreement. In direct competition, the European Union and the
U.S. have tapped into Global Gateway funds to reconstruct and expand the Lobito railway corridor that connects the cooper belt in Zambia and the Congo to the Atlantic Ocean in Angola. (The Global
Gateway is a framework for cooperation that also includes the African Development Bank and Africa Finance Corp.)
The bigger issues that will bedevil peace efforts are systemic and immutable. The first is an extremely frustrating and variegated geography. The Congo’s vast territory is marked by extensive
rainforests that stymie central control over its farther reaches. Indeed, the country’s state capacity and security deficiencies are profound. The military is fragmented, poorly organized and
struggles with difficult logistical constraints. Very little infrastructure connects one part of the country to another, so equipment and personnel need to be airlifted across the country – a costly
and, with M23 in control of eastern airports, dangerous prospect.
Corruption, inconsistent training and competing loyalties, meanwhile, undermine coherent command and control. It’s not unheard of for soldiers who feel they are cut off from reinforcements to flee
the frontlines or surrender in the face of fighting. Armed groups operate relatively freely not because they are especially strong but because the state is underrepresented in peripheral areas. Local
governance structures are similarly fractured, with overlapping claims of authority and legitimacy.
The second issue is the role played by Rwanda. Rwanda has long seen the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda – an armed Hutu group operating in eastern Congo – as an existential threat.
(The country is ruled by the Tutsis, which comprise just 15 percent of the population.) It’s little surprise, then, that the Rwandan government overtly supports the Tutsi rebels of M23. By
sustaining a friendly force in Congolese territory, Rwanda insulates itself from threats and extends its influence into a region rich in minerals in exchange for finance and continued arms supply.
Illicit minerals, especially gold and coltan, pour into Rwanda to feed the domestic refining and re-export industries that have buoyed its economic growth. This relationship also gives Rwanda
geopolitical leverage: By sustaining the conflict at a manageable, low-intensity level, Kigali retains bargaining power with international actors who want stability for commercial or humanitarian
reasons.
Here, Uganda deserves an honorable mention. It plays an important if less overt role in shaping regional dynamics. The government in Kampala has long held loose ties with rebel movements in eastern
Congo, both as a patron and as an economic stakeholder in the cross-border mineral trade. Relations between Rwanda and Uganda are tense, marked by intermittent intelligence rivalries and competing
influence networks among Congolese armed groups. Though Uganda’s security establishment is officially aligned with Kinshasa in its counterinsurgency efforts, some elements have occasionally
tolerated or indirectly benefited from M23’s presence to counterbalance Rwandan dominance and secure access routes for smuggled coltan and gold. This quiet rivalry complicates regional coordination
and undermines collective enforcement of ceasefire or demobilization accords.

The third major issue preventing resolution is that the war economy has become self-perpetuating. Control over mining sites, particularly coltan deposits in areas like Rubaya, has given M23 steady
revenue streams through taxation of local miners and smuggling. This financial autonomy allows the group to sustain operations even in the absence of large-scale battlefield offensives. The informal
mineral trade, often laundered through cross-border networks, has created powerful economic constituencies with no incentive to see the war end.
Finally, pressures in the Kivu region continue to provide combustible material for armed mobilization. Longstanding disputes over land, ethnic ownership and political representation have imbedded
themselves into the security environment, making any purely military or diplomatic solution incomplete. Moreover, a low average age, low employment rates and poor living conditions provide fertile
ground for militant recruitment. The region has long played host to various armed groups with malleable allegiances and territorial control.
And this is to say nothing of the foreign actors from farther afield – namely, China and the U.S. Beijing is by far the most dominant actor in the Congo’s formal mining sector. Through a
combination of infrastructure-for-resources deals and direct corporate operations – notably through CMOC and the Sicomines joint venture – Chinese firms control much of the copper-cobalt
extraction and export. A 2024 renegotiation raised infrastructure commitments to up to $7 billion and added a 1.2 percent royalty for the state (this follows findings that of more than $10 billion in
committed funds from 2016, only approximately $700 million had been spent by Beijing). China-backed companies own or have a financial stake in 15 of the Congo's 19 cobalt-producing mines, and 100
percent of cobalt exports go to Beijing. More than 66 percent of the country’s copper exports also are exported to China.
Crucially, instability in the east has not disrupted mining flows in a way that threatens Chinese interests. This gives Beijing little incentive to involve itself in mediation. Instead, its strategy
appears to be one of quiet consolidation. It has, for example, secured long-term mining concessions and infrastructure control, while leaving the security question to others.
Washington, meanwhile, is trying to secure mineral extraction rights of its own. It signed a peace-for-resources deal in June, though it has failed to come to fruition. Blackwater founder Erik Prince
signed a deal with the Congolese government in April to help the country secure and monetize its vast mineral reserves as part of this push, but this, too, has yielded nothing significant.
The Trump administration is interested in stabilizing the country so that it can get in on its minerals, but without any commitment to put boots on the ground, there is no practical way to force M23
to cede territory. Washington is also a strong supporter of Rwanda, and one of the biggest export markets for the country’s coltan – licitly gained or otherwise – so any deal it advances is
likely more of an attempt to dislodge China than to achieve peace for peace’s sake.
Kinshasa’s efforts to leverage its mineral resources into foreign support have affected the global cobalt market. In February, it placed an export ban on cobalt to boost prices, which had dropped 75
percent between March 2022 and January 2025. The ban has now been replaced by an annual export quota system that took effect mid-October and allows for the export of 18,125 tons for the rest of 2025
and 96,600 tons per year in 2026 and 2027.
Lurking in the background is a domestic standoff between Tshisekedi and former President Joseph Kabila, whom authorities have accused of masterminding the insurgency and colluding with Rwanda and M23.
A military court has sentenced him to death in absentia. This power struggle is likely to further complicate a resolution to the crisis and make it more difficult for Western actors to engage.
A managed stalemate is the most likely outcome, especially in the near term, as illicit minerals flow. Until governance and extraction are decoupled, any peace process will remain ornamental.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This week, the Uni=
ted States hosted a third round of talks to broker peace between the Democr=
atic Republic of the Congo and M23, a rebel group that has taken over much =
of the mineral-rich eastern portion of the country. The ultimate purpose of=
 Washington=E2=80=99s involvement is to obtain mining licenses for critical=
 minerals. Standing in its way is China, which maintains a dominant positio=
n in the country and thus has reason to impede U.S. mediation efforts. Mean=
while, Rwanda =E2=80=93 the other principal in the conflict in the Congo =
=E2=80=93 benefits from the status quo. Without a major (and unlikely) comm=
itment of U.S. troops, there is little reason to believe the conflict will =
end anytime soon.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Over the past year=
, Qatar, the U.S., Kenya and Angola have all hosted peace talks between the=
 Congo and M23. The group has said its end goal is to overthrow President F=
elix Tshisekedi, but geography and military capability will almost certainl=
y prevent it from doing so. Similar constraints prevent the government in K=
inshasa from dislodging M23. The government alternates between negotiating =
and exploiting market leverage, while M23 continues to control areas surrou=
nding key mining zones, including Goma and Bukavu. There is no evidence to =
suggest the group is willing or politically able to roll back its gains.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The situation in t=
he Congo is hardly a local affair. As cobalt and copper become more essenti=
al to things like battery technologies, electric vehicles and high-performa=
nce jet engines, global powers are recalibrating their strategies to secure=
 supply chains. The EU=E2=80=99s Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S.=E2=
=80=99s Critical Minerals Security Act of 2024 evince as much. Shoring up s=
upply lines for critical minerals is not just a matter of economics; over-r=
elying on the production and refining capacity of potentially adversarial s=
tates exposes foundational (and exploitable) weakness, so it is also a matt=
er of national security. And because the Congo is home to 70 percent of the=
 world's cobalt production, supplies 40 percent of its coltan, and meets ar=
ound 13 percent of global copper demand, the country has become one of the =
more important arenas in the competition between the U.S. and China.</p>

/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Naturally, the com=
petition complicates, and is complicated by, the conflict in the east. On O=
ct. 14, the government and M23 signed an agreement to create a body to moni=
tor a ceasefire =E2=80=93 one of two conditions needed for formal peace tal=
ks to take place. But whatever progress this seems to convey should be take=
n with a grain of salt. Financially, M23 is sustained by a resource-driven =
war economy and by cross-border material backing from Rwanda, with which it=
 shares an ethnic Tutsi identity. Rwanda benefits from M23=E2=80=99s illici=
t mineral trade, while the government in Kigali supplies arms and ammunitio=
n to M23. A military mission launched by the Southern African Development C=
ommunity ended last summer, so one of the few things that actually constrai=
ned M23 is gone. A U.N. mission has also failed to bring peace.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In light of these =
failures, Kinshasa has experimented with economic policies to change the st=
atus quo. It has, for example, banned cobalt exports, set new quotas and of=
fered certain mining concessions to attract other foreign actors. China=E2=
=80=99s copper-cobalt machine, meanwhile, has continued to operate virtuall=
y unimpeded through the partially state-owned Sicomines and CMOC, even as d=
iplomats try again to separate security dilemmas from supply chains. And th=
e U.S. has become increasingly involved in an attempt to mediate in a resou=
rces-for-security transaction.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">U.S. involvement h=
as prompted China to renovate the TAZARA railway, which links eastern Congo=
 to the Indian Ocean ports, via a $1.4 billion agreement. In direct competi=
tion, the European Union and the U.S. have tapped into Global Gateway funds=
 to reconstruct and expand the Lobito railway corridor that connects the co=
oper belt in Zambia and the Congo to the Atlantic Ocean in Angola. (The Glo=
bal Gateway is a framework for cooperation that also includes the African D=
evelopment Bank and Africa Finance Corp.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The bigger issues =
that will bedevil peace efforts are systemic and immutable. The first is an=
 extremely frustrating and variegated geography. The Congo=E2=80=99s vast t=
erritory is marked by extensive rainforests that stymie central control ove=
r its farther reaches. Indeed, the country=E2=80=99s state capacity and sec=
urity deficiencies are profound. The military is fragmented, poorly organiz=
ed and struggles with difficult logistical constraints. Very little infrast=
ructure connects one part of the country to another, so equipment and perso=
nnel need to be airlifted across the country =E2=80=93 a costly and, with M=
23 in control of eastern airports, dangerous prospect.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Corruption, incons=
istent training and competing loyalties, meanwhile, undermine coherent comm=
and and control. It=E2=80=99s not unheard of for soldiers who feel they are=
 cut off from reinforcements to flee the frontlines or surrender in the fac=
e of fighting. Armed groups operate relatively freely not because they are =
especially strong but because the state is underrepresented in peripheral a=
reas. Local governance structures are similarly fractured, with overlapping=
 claims of authority and legitimacy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The second issue i=
s the role played by Rwanda. Rwanda has long seen the Democratic Forces for=
 the Liberation of Rwanda =E2=80=93 an armed Hutu group operating in easter=
n Congo =E2=80=93 as an existential threat. (The country is ruled by the Tu=
tsis, which comprise just 15 percent of the population.) It=E2=80=99s littl=
e surprise, then, that the Rwandan government overtly supports the Tutsi re=
bels of M23. By sustaining a friendly force in Congolese territory, Rwanda =
insulates itself from threats and extends its influence into a region rich =
in minerals in exchange for finance and continued arms supply. Illicit mine=
rals, especially gold and coltan, pour into Rwanda to feed the domestic ref=
ining and re-export industries that have buoyed its economic growth. This r=
elationship also gives Rwanda geopolitical leverage: By sustaining the conf=
lict at a manageable, low-intensity level, Kigali retains bargaining power =
with international actors who want stability for commercial or humanitarian=
 reasons.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Here, Uganda deser=
ves an honorable mention. It plays an important if less overt role in shapi=
ng regional dynamics. The government in Kampala has long held loose ties wi=
th rebel movements in eastern Congo, both as a patron and as an economic st=
akeholder in the cross-border mineral trade. Relations between Rwanda and U=
ganda are tense, marked by intermittent intelligence rivalries and competin=
g influence networks among Congolese armed groups. Though Uganda=E2=80=99s =
security establishment is officially aligned with Kinshasa in its counterin=
surgency efforts, some elements have occasionally tolerated or indirectly b=
enefited from M23=E2=80=99s presence to counterbalance Rwandan dominance an=
d secure access routes for smuggled coltan and gold. This quiet rivalry com=
plicates regional coordination and undermines collective enforcement of cea=
sefire or demobilization accords.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The third major is=
sue preventing resolution is that the war economy has become self-perpetuat=
ing. Control over mining sites, particularly coltan deposits in areas like =
Rubaya, has given M23 steady revenue streams through taxation of local mine=
rs and smuggling. This financial autonomy allows the group to sustain opera=
tions even in the absence of large-scale battlefield offensives. The inform=
al mineral trade, often laundered through cross-border networks, has create=
d powerful economic constituencies with no incentive to see the war end.</p=
>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Finally, pressures=
 in the Kivu region continue to provide combustible material for armed mobi=
lization. Longstanding disputes over land, ethnic ownership and political r=
epresentation have imbedded themselves into the security environment, makin=
g any purely military or diplomatic solution incomplete. Moreover, a low av=
erage age, low employment rates and poor living conditions provide fertile =
ground for militant recruitment. The region has long played host to various=
 armed groups with malleable allegiances and territorial control.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">And this is to say=
 nothing of the foreign actors from farther afield =E2=80=93 namely, China =
and the U.S. Beijing is by far the most dominant actor in the Congo=E2=80=
=99s formal mining sector. Through a combination of infrastructure-for-reso=
urces deals and direct corporate operations =E2=80=93 notably through CMOC =
and the Sicomines joint venture =E2=80=93 Chinese firms control much of the=
 copper-cobalt extraction and export. A 2024 renegotiation raised infrastru=
cture commitments to up to $7 billion and added a 1.2 percent royalty for t=
he state (this follows findings that of more than $10 billion in committed =
funds from 2016, only approximately $700 million had been spent by Beijing)=
. China-backed companies own or have a financial stake in 15 of the Congo's=
 19 cobalt-producing mines, and 100 percent of cobalt exports go to Beijing=
. More than 66 percent of the country=E2=80=99s copper exports also are exp=
orted to China.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Crucially, instabi=
lity in the east has not disrupted mining flows in a way that threatens Chi=
nese interests. This gives Beijing little incentive to involve itself in me=
diation. Instead, its strategy appears to be one of quiet consolidation. It=
 has, for example, secured long-term mining concessions and infrastructure =
control, while leaving the security question to others.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Washington, meanwh=
ile, is trying to secure mineral extraction rights of its own. It signed a =
peace-for-resources deal in June, though it has failed to come to fruition.=
 Blackwater founder Erik Prince signed a deal with the Congolese government=
 in April to help the country secure and monetize its vast mineral reserves=
 as part of this push, but this, too, has yielded nothing significant.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Trump administ=
ration is interested in stabilizing the country so that it can get in on it=
s minerals, but without any commitment to put boots on the ground, there is=
 no practical way to force M23 to cede territory. Washington is also a stro=
ng supporter of Rwanda, and one of the biggest export markets for the count=
ry=E2=80=99s coltan =E2=80=93 licitly gained or otherwise =E2=80=93 so any =
deal it advances is likely more of an attempt to dislodge China than to ach=
ieve peace for peace=E2=80=99s sake.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Kinshasa=E2=80=99s=
 efforts to leverage its mineral resources into foreign support have affect=
ed the global cobalt market. In February, it placed an export ban on cobalt=
 to boost prices, which had dropped 75 percent between March 2022 and Janua=
ry 2025. The ban has now been replaced by an annual export quota system tha=
t took effect mid-October and allows for the export of 18,125 tons for the =
rest of 2025 and 96,600 tons per year in 2026 and 2027.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Lurking in the bac=
kground is a domestic standoff between Tshisekedi and former President Jose=
ph Kabila, whom authorities have accused of masterminding the insurgency an=
d colluding with Rwanda and M23. A military court has sentenced him to deat=
h in absentia. This power struggle is likely to further complicate a resolu=
tion to the crisis and make it more difficult for Western actors to engage.=
</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">A managed stalemat=
e is the most likely outcome, especially in the near term, as illicit miner=
als flow. Until governance and extraction are decoupled, any peace process =
will remain ornamental.</p>
