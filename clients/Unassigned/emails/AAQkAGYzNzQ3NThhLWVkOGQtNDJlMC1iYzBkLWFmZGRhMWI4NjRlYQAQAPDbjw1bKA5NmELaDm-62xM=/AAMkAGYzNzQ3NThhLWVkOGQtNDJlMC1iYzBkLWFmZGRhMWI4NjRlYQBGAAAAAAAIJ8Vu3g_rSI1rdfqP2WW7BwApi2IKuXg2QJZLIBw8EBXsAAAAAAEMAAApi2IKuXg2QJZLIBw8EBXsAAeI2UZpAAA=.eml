THE BUDGET TRAP IS CLOSING ON RUSSIA [3]
THE UPCOMING BUDGET WILL BE MUCH TRICKIER THAN THE PAST COUPLE.
BY: EKATERINA ZOLOTOVA
Russia is about to make tough decisions as it sets its federal budget for 2026. In simple terms, the budget defines revenues and expenditures and, since 2022, assesses how much the state can spend on
the economy without hurting the war effort in Ukraine. The Kremlin knows it has little room for error as it supports both civilian and military economies while earning enough money to replenish the
National Wealth Fund and forestalling a major deficit. (The fund comprises oil and gas revenues and is used as a sort of emergency fund to ensure stability and support major infrastructure projects.)
And as the pressure from sanctions rises, so does the pressure on decision-makers and civilians alike.
From a geopolitical perspective, the federal budget is viewed by the ruling authorities as a tool for achieving one of their geopolitical imperatives: maintaining public loyalty by setting a certain
standard of living. The Kremlin has, therefore, traditionally earmarked the majority of its spending on economic stimulus and social services – health care, education, law enforcement and the like.
According to the 2022 census, one in three Russians was dependent on state payments – that is, pensions, unemployment payments, social benefits, subsidies and other benefits. The percentage
dramatically increases when it includes public sector workers.
The conflict in Ukraine, however, has turned the Russian market economy into a war economy. Defense and security are now the top priorities of the new Russian budget. National defense spending has
climbed to 32.5 percent of the federal budget, up from 15 percent in 2021. Meanwhile, Moscow has to continue to fulfill its social obligations to Russian citizens, leading to a growing budget deficit.
For a few years, the Kremlin was able to finance essential sectors through the National Wealth Fund, loans, and oil and gas revenue, which accounts for roughly a third of total state revenue.
[Draft Russian Budget, 2026] [4]

The government is no longer confident that it can sufficiently meet all its financial obligations. The 2025 budget was calculated back in November 2024 based on a number of now-outdated economic
criteria. The 2026 budget is being calculated with lower gross domestic product and growth expectations, a stronger ruble, reduced export volumes and higher inflation.
[Russia's Deviation From Planned Economic Indicators] [6]

The budget process is also complicated by the uncertainty surrounding sanctions and the war in Ukraine. In the absence of peace talks that would satisfy the Kremlin, and with NATO's increased activity
near Russia's borders, it seems unlikely the war will end in the near future. That means that sanctions will probably continue, and that the next budget will be a military budget – not just
something that pays for equipment and service but a fund that supports “care infrastructure” for soldiers, veterans and their families until the war ends.
It’s unclear how the Kremlin will maintain such high spending without relying on the budget replenishment and deficit financing methods used in previous years. Although the 2026 plan calls for a
gradual decline in oil and gas revenue, this sector will still account for 25 percent of the state budget (down from 30 percent in the 2024 budget). And there is uncertainty in the sector too:
insufficient long-term contracts, fluctations in price and demand, and logistics. The price of oil itself and the Russian ruble affect the amount of revenue coming into the budget. Given the
tightening of sanctions, the strict price cap and the price dynamics of Urals (currently at around $60 per barrel), it’s unlikely that Russia will be able to secure a steady stream of oil and gas
revenue, especially now with the ruble as high as it is.
Russia is concerned that new sanctions will deprive it of oil and gas revenue, but it also knows it will be difficult and painful to take Russian oil off the market entirely. Partly this is because
there are no good alternatives for the quality and quantity of Russian crude. The bigger issue for Moscow is that Russia needs to prop up its National Wealth Fund, which in recent years has been
partially depleted. In June, the fund held 11.6 trillion rubles ($16.7 billion) – 1.4 trillion rubles less than in December 2024. (Of this amount, 1.3 trillion rubles financed the 2024 state budget
deficit.) By August, Russia managed to increase the fund's holdings to 13 trillion rubles, but the government is in no rush to spend the reserve funds it only now accumulated. And in any case, cash
injections are one-time measures that can’t be accurately predicted, and pumping too much cash into the economy without a corresponding increase in production can raise inflation. Therefore, the
government will give preference to funding large infrastructure projects that will boost the slowing economy and stimulate trade flows rather than allowing the budget hole to be covered again with
money from the National Welfare Fund.
The government is now trying to come up with safety nets for the fund. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently noted that the oil cutoff price under the budget will be gradually reduced from the
current $60 per barrel to $55 by 2030. (This is the number above which money goes to the National Wealth Fund.) This means the budget will receive less money from oil sales. Incidentally, it will be
impossible to use incoming National Wealth Funds to cover the growing deficit once the practice is banned in 2026.
[Execution of Russian Federal Budget] [8]
_(click to enlarge)_ [9]
It's no surprise, then, that the Kremlin is seeking other ways to earn revenue. Non-oil sectors account for up to two-thirds of the federal budget. Russia has already taken measures to increase
personal income tax revenues, including a five-tiered tax scale that came into effect in 2025. This, along with rising wages, led to an increase in tax revenue but had very little impact (less than 1
percent) on the overall budget. A much more effective tool for containing the budget deficit could be reforms to the value-added tax, which accounts for more than half of non-oil and gas budget
revenue. In amendments submitted to the government for consideration, the Ministry of Finance has suggested increasing the VAT rate from 20 percent to 22 percent for all VAT-paying companies and
lowering the VAT exemption threshold for businesses from 60 million rubles to 10 million rubles. It’s unclear when this will happen, but considering the circumstances, it’s only a matter of time.
What does this mean for Russian consumers? The VAT increase will raise the tax burdens on businesses, which, by all the laws of economics, will pass the increase on to the end consumer. This means
higher retail prices, accelerated inflation, and, ultimately, an increase in the key interest rate – which will place some pressure on non-defense-related businesses. Inflation is inevitable, but
unlike the unreliable, one-time injections of funds from the National Wealth Fund into the economy, this is more predictable and accountable. Public discontent will rise too, but the government is
counting on the increase in nominal wages over the past year to mitigate the impact and prevent protests.
The trap the state is gradually driving itself into is closing as Russia continues to channel huge cash flows to the front during a cooling economy for which there is no stable outside income.
Uncertainty is becoming a serious challenge for the Russian economy. The question is how long Russia can sustain itself before it goes to the negotiating table.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia is about to=
 make tough decisions as it sets its federal budget for 2026. In simple ter=
ms, the budget defines revenues and expenditures and, since 2022, assesses =
how much the state can spend on the economy without hurting the war effort =
in Ukraine. The Kremlin knows it has little room for error as it supports b=
oth civilian and military economies while earning enough money to replenish=
 the National Wealth Fund and forestalling a major deficit. (The fund compr=
ises oil and gas revenues and is used as a sort of emergency fund to ensure=
 stability and support major infrastructure projects.) And as the pressure =
from sanctions rises, so does the pressure on decision-makers and civilians=
 alike.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">From a geopolitica=
l perspective, the federal budget is viewed by the ruling authorities as a =
tool for achieving one of their geopolitical imperatives: maintaining publi=
c loyalty by setting a certain standard of living. The Kremlin has, therefo=
re, traditionally earmarked the majority of its spending on economic stimul=
us and social services =E2=80=93 health care, education, law enforcement an=
d the like. According to the 2022 census, one in three Russians was depende=
nt on state payments =E2=80=93 that is, pensions, unemployment payments, so=
cial benefits, subsidies and other benefits. The percentage dramatically in=
creases when it includes public sector workers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The conflict in Uk=
raine, however, has turned the Russian market economy into a war economy. D=
efense and security are now the top priorities of the new Russian budget. N=
ational defense spending has climbed to 32.5 percent of the federal budget,=
 up from 15 percent in 2021. Meanwhile, Moscow has to continue to fulfill i=
ts social obligations to Russian citizens, leading to a growing budget defi=
cit. For a few years, the Kremlin was able to finance essential sectors thr=
ough the National Wealth Fund, loans, and oil and gas revenue, which accoun=
ts for roughly a third of total state revenue.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The government is =
no longer confident that it can sufficiently meet all its financial obligat=
ions. The 2025 budget was calculated back in November 2024 based on a numbe=
r of now-outdated economic criteria. The 2026 budget is being calculated wi=
th lower gross domestic product and growth expectations, a stronger ruble, =
reduced export volumes and higher inflation.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The budget process=
 is also complicated by the uncertainty surrounding sanctions and the war i=
n Ukraine. In the absence of peace talks that would satisfy the Kremlin, an=
d with NATO's increased activity near Russia's borders, it seems unlikely t=
he war will end in the near future. That means that sanctions will probably=
 continue, and that the next budget will be a military budget =E2=80=93 not=
 just something that pays for equipment and service but a fund that support=
s =E2=80=9Ccare infrastructure=E2=80=9D for soldiers, veterans and their fa=
milies until the war ends.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s uncle=
ar how the Kremlin will maintain such high spending without relying on the =
budget replenishment and deficit financing methods used in previous years. =
Although the 2026 plan calls for a gradual decline in oil and gas revenue, =
this sector will still account for 25 percent of the state budget (down fro=
m 30 percent in the 2024 budget). And there is uncertainty in the sector to=
o: insufficient long-term contracts, fluctations in price and demand, and l=
ogistics. The price of oil itself and the Russian ruble affect the amount o=
f revenue coming into the budget. Given the tightening of sanctions, the st=
rict price cap and the price dynamics of Urals (currently at around $60 per=
 barrel), it=E2=80=99s unlikely that Russia will be able to secure a steady=
 stream of oil and gas revenue, especially now with the ruble as high as it=
 is.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Russia is concerne=
d that new sanctions will deprive it of oil and gas revenue, but it also kn=
ows it will be difficult and painful to take Russian oil off the market ent=
irely. Partly this is because there are no good alternatives for the qualit=
y and quantity of Russian crude. The bigger issue for Moscow is that Russia=
 needs to prop up its National Wealth Fund, which in recent years has been =
partially depleted. In June, the fund held 11.6 trillion rubles ($16.7 bill=
ion) =E2=80=93 1.4 trillion rubles less than in December 2024. (Of this amo=
unt, 1.3 trillion rubles financed the 2024 state budget deficit.) By August=
, Russia managed to increase the fund's holdings to 13 trillion rubles, but=
 the government is in no rush to spend the reserve funds it only now accumu=
lated. And in any case, cash injections are one-time measures that can=E2=
=80=99t be accurately predicted, and pumping too much cash into the economy=
 without a corresponding increase in production can raise inflation. Theref=
ore, the government will give preference to funding large infrastructure pr=
ojects that will boost the slowing economy and stimulate trade flows rather=
 than allowing the budget hole to be covered again with money from the Nati=
onal Welfare Fund.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The government is =
now trying to come up with safety nets for the fund. Finance Minister Anton=
 Siluanov recently noted that the oil cutoff price under the budget will be=
 gradually reduced from the current $60 per barrel to $55 by 2030. (This is=
 the number above which money goes to the National Wealth Fund.) This means=
 the budget will receive less money from oil sales. Incidentally, it will b=
e impossible to use incoming National Wealth Funds to cover the growing def=
icit once the practice is banned in 2026.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It's no surprise, =
then, that the Kremlin is seeking other ways to earn revenue. Non-oil secto=
rs account for up to two-thirds of the federal budget. Russia has already t=
aken measures to increase personal income tax revenues, including a five-ti=
ered tax scale that came into effect in 2025. This, along with rising wages=
, led to an increase in tax revenue but had very little impact (less than 1=
 percent) on the overall budget. A much more effective tool for containing =
the budget deficit could be reforms to the value-added tax, which accounts =
for more than half of non-oil and gas budget revenue. In amendments submitt=
ed to the government for consideration, the Ministry of Finance has suggest=
ed increasing the VAT rate from 20 percent to 22 percent for all VAT-paying=
 companies and lowering the VAT exemption threshold for businesses from 60 =
million rubles to 10 million rubles. It=E2=80=99s unclear when this will ha=
ppen, but considering the circumstances, it=E2=80=99s only a matter of time=
.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">What does this mea=
n for Russian consumers? The VAT increase will raise the tax burdens on bus=
inesses, which, by all the laws of economics, will pass the increase on to =
the end consumer. This means higher retail prices, accelerated inflation, a=
nd, ultimately, an increase in the key interest rate =E2=80=93 which will p=
lace some pressure on non-defense-related businesses. Inflation is inevitab=
le, but unlike the unreliable, one-time injections of funds from the Nation=
al Wealth Fund into the economy, this is more predictable and accountable. =
Public discontent will rise too, but the government is counting on the incr=
ease in nominal wages over the past year to mitigate the impact and prevent=
 protests.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The trap the state=
 is gradually driving itself into is closing as Russia continues to channel=
 huge cash flows to the front during a cooling economy for which there is n=
o stable outside income. Uncertainty is becoming a serious challenge for th=
e Russian economy. The question is how long Russia can sustain itself befor=
e it goes to the negotiating table.</p>
