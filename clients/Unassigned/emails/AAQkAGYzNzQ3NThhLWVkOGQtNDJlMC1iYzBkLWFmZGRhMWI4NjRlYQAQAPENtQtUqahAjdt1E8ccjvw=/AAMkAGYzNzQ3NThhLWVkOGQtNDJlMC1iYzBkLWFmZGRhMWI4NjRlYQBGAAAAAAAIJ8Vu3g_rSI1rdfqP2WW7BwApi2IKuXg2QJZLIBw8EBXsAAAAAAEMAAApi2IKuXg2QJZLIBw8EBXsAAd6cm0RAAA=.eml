JORDAN AND THE NEXT MIDDLE EASTERN WAR [3]
ISRAEL’S PURSUIT OF SECURITY IN SOUTHERN SYRIA AND THE WEST BANK COULD UPSET THE REGION.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
While the latest war between Israel and Hamas nears its second anniversary, yet another conflict is taking shape to Israel’s east. Israeli plans to annex large parts of the West Bank, the Israeli
military’s expanding buffer zone northeast of the Golan Heights and clashes in Druze-majority areas of southern Syria together point to a new arc of instability. Unlike the Israel-Hamas war, which
has remained largely contained within Gaza, military operations in these adjacent theaters could directly destabilize Jordan and beyond.
[Middle East] [4]

Despite the risks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is forging ahead. On Sept. 2, The New York Times reported that the Israeli military’s chief of staff, the head of the Mossad spy agency,
the national security adviser and the foreign minister all oppose Netanyahu’s plans for a new Gaza offensive. He is preparing to convene his security Cabinet on Sept. 4 to discuss the possibility of
annexing parts of the West Bank in response to international efforts to recognize a Palestinian state. Israeli forces remain on the ground in southern Lebanon, where the U.S. is leading diplomatic
efforts to disarm Hezbollah. And a week ago, Netanyahu outlined three ambitious Israeli objectives in Syria: protecting the Druze community in Sweida province and surrounding areas, extending a
demilitarized zone south of Damascus to Druze-majority areas along Jordan’s northern border, and establishing a humanitarian corridor to supply food, medical aid and construction materials. This was
one day after Israeli forces conducted a raid near the Syrian capital – a rare ground operation well beyond the buffer zone Israel created after the Assad regime fell last December.
Surrounded by adversaries, Israel’s strategic imperative is to drive back all potential threats along its borders. Although military operations are ongoing in Gaza and southern Lebanon, attention in
both theaters is increasingly on post-conflict arrangements. Therefore, the focus of Israel’s kinetic operations is shifting toward its northeastern and eastern frontiers.
In Syria, Israel has established a buffer zone that spans from Lebanon in the north to Jordan in the south. It stretches between two key tri-border areas: Mount Hermon, where Israel and Syria meet
Lebanon, and the Yarmouk Valley, where Israel and Syria meet Jordan. The buffer zone’s core area in Syria’s Quneitra province covers 450-500 square miles (1,165-1,300 square kilometers), while the
expanded operational zone, extending into Daraa and Sweida provinces, encompasses 1,800-2,000 square miles. The buffer zone is designed to insulate Israel from potential attacks by Sunni Islamist
factions aligned with the new Syrian government of President Ahmad al-Sharaa.
[Israel, Syria & Jordan] [6]
_(click to enlarge)_ [7]
Backed by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration, al-Sharaa is trying to establish a new political economy in the Levantine nation. The Israeli buffer zone represents a major challenge to
his nascent authority. For this reason, Damascus has been negotiating with Israel under Washington's mediation. Al-Sharaa has no interest in a clash with Israel, which would prevent him from
consolidating power.
However, Israel sees the emerging order in Syria as a long-term threat. To prevent Damascus from bringing southern Syria under its control, Israel has been supporting Sweida-based rebel Druze factions
that are clashing with local Arab tribes and Islamist factions allied with the al-Sharaa government. As a next step, Israel will have to expand its buffer zone to include Sweida. Indeed, the Netanyahu
government’s stated plan is to establish a demilitarized zone encompassing much of Syria’s three southernmost provinces: Quneitra, Daraa and Sweida.
[Syrian Ethnic and Sectarian Groups] [8]
_(click to enlarge)_ [9]
Such a plan clearly undercuts al-Sharaa’s efforts to unite Syria’s various religious and ethnic minorities under a new political regime. The most significant of these minorities are the Alawites
in the northwestern coastal region and, even more critically, the Kurds in the northeast, who are Syria’s largest minority group and who have enjoyed de facto self-rule for more than a decade. The
fate of Syria’s Kurds is the primary concern for al-Sharaa’s main backer, Turkey, which has its own Kurdish separatism problem.
If Damascus cannot get a handle on the Druze rebellion, it sets a bad precedent and works against efforts toward building a Syrian nation-state. Thus, al-Sharaa’s government has no choice but to
ensure that it does not lose control of the three provinces south of the capital. Either it reaches an accord with Israel, or southern Syria will be a conflict zone for the foreseeable future.
There is a serious risk that such a conflict would spill over into Jordan, particularly the northern provinces of Mafraq and Irbid. Jordan is already concerned about how the situation in the
Palestinian territories might affect domestic stability. Given that as many as 60 percent of Jordanians are of Palestinian heritage, Amman has worked hard to contain any fallout from the war in Gaza.
The worsening situation in the West Bank, with the expansion of Jewish settlements under the current right-wing Israeli government, is a far more immediate concern for Jordan. Should Israel follow
through on its plans to annex large parts of the West Bank, the ensuing conflict could affect Balqa and Madaba, two provinces that border the Palestinian region and are not far from the capital,
Amman.
In essence, there is a growing risk of conflict over a wide area from southern Syria to northwestern Jordan and involving both state and nonstate actors. This turn of events would be a major setback
for Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which have a shared interest in stabilizing Syria. Though Turkey is doing the heavy lifting in Syria, instability in Jordan would be perilously close for Saudi Arabia.
Already asserting itself as a regional leader [10], Riyadh will likely have to spearhead a new security initiative.

parts of the West Bank, the Israeli military=E2=80=99s expanding buffer zon=
e northeast of the Golan Heights and clashes in Druze-majority areas of sou=
thern Syria together point to a new arc of instability. Unlike the Israel-H=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Despite the risks,=
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is forging ahead. On Sept. 2, Th=
e New York Times reported that the Israeli military=E2=80=99s chief of staf=
f, the head of the Mossad spy agency, the national security adviser and the=
 foreign minister all oppose Netanyahu=E2=80=99s plans for a new Gaza offen=
sive. He is preparing to convene his security Cabinet on Sept. 4 to discuss=
 the possibility of annexing parts of the West Bank in response to internat=
ional efforts to recognize a Palestinian state. Israeli forces remain on th=
e ground in southern Lebanon, where the U.S. is leading diplomatic efforts =
to disarm Hezbollah. And a week ago, Netanyahu outlined three ambitious Isr=
aeli objectives in Syria: protecting the Druze community in Sweida province=
 and surrounding areas, extending a demilitarized zone south of Damascus to=
 Druze-majority areas along Jordan=E2=80=99s northern border, and establish=
ing a humanitarian corridor to supply food, medical aid and construction ma=
terials. This was one day after Israeli forces conducted a raid near the Sy=
rian capital =E2=80=93 a rare ground operation well beyond the buffer zone =
Israel created after the Assad regime fell last December.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Surrounded by adve=
rsaries, Israel=E2=80=99s strategic imperative is to drive back all potenti=
al threats along its borders. Although military operations are ongoing in G=
aza and southern Lebanon, attention in both theaters is increasingly on pos=
t-conflict arrangements. Therefore, the focus of Israel=E2=80=99s kinetic o=
perations is shifting toward its northeastern and eastern frontiers.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In Syria, Israel h=
as established a buffer zone that spans from Lebanon in the north to Jordan=
 in the south. It stretches between two key tri-border areas: Mount Hermon,=
 where Israel and Syria meet Lebanon, and the Yarmouk Valley, where Israel =
and Syria meet Jordan. The buffer zone=E2=80=99s core area in Syria=E2=80=
=99s Quneitra province covers 450-500 square miles (1,165-1,300 square kilo=
meters), while the expanded operational zone, extending into Daraa and Swei=
da provinces, encompasses 1,800-2,000 square miles. The buffer zone is desi=
gned to insulate Israel from potential attacks by Sunni Islamist factions a=
ligned with the new Syrian government of President Ahmad al-Sharaa.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Backed by Turkey, =
Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration, al-Sharaa is trying to establish=
 a new political economy in the Levantine nation. The Israeli buffer zone r=
epresents a major challenge to his nascent authority. For this reason, Dama=
scus has been negotiating with Israel under Washington's mediation. Al-Shar=
aa has no interest in a clash with Israel, which would prevent him from con=
solidating power.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">However, Israel se=
es the emerging order in Syria as a long-term threat. To prevent Damascus f=
rom bringing southern Syria under its control, Israel has been supporting S=
weida-based rebel Druze factions that are clashing with local Arab tribes a=
nd Islamist factions allied with the al-Sharaa government. As a next step, =
Israel will have to expand its buffer zone to include Sweida. Indeed, the N=
etanyahu government=E2=80=99s stated plan is to establish a demilitarized z=
one encompassing much of Syria=E2=80=99s three southernmost provinces: Qune=
itra, Daraa and Sweida.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Such a plan clearl=
y undercuts al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s efforts to unite Syria=E2=80=99s various re=
ligious and ethnic minorities under a new political regime. The most signif=
icant of these minorities are the Alawites in the northwestern coastal regi=
on and, even more critically, the Kurds in the northeast, who are Syria=E2=
=80=99s largest minority group and who have enjoyed de facto self-rule for =
more than a decade. The fate of Syria=E2=80=99s Kurds is the primary concer=
n for al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s main backer, Turkey, which has its own Kurdish se=
paratism problem.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">If Damascus cannot=
 get a handle on the Druze rebellion, it sets a bad precedent and works aga=
inst efforts toward building a Syrian nation-state. Thus, al-Sharaa=E2=80=
=99s government has no choice but to ensure that it does not lose control o=
f the three provinces south of the capital. Either it reaches an accord wit=
h Israel, or southern Syria will be a conflict zone for the foreseeable fut=
ure.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There is a serious=
 risk that such a conflict would spill over into Jordan, particularly the n=
orthern provinces of Mafraq and Irbid. Jordan is already concerned about ho=
w the situation in the Palestinian territories might affect domestic stabil=
ity. Given that as many as 60 percent of Jordanians are of Palestinian heri=
tage, Amman has worked hard to contain any fallout from the war in Gaza. Th=
e worsening situation in the West Bank, with the expansion of Jewish settle=
ments under the current right-wing Israeli government, is a far more immedi=
ate concern for Jordan. Should Israel follow through on its plans to annex =
large parts of the West Bank, the ensuing conflict could affect Balqa and M=
adaba, two provinces that border the Palestinian region and are not far fro=
m the capital, Amman.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In essence, there =
is a growing risk of conflict over a wide area from southern Syria to north=
western Jordan and involving both state and nonstate actors. This turn of e=
vents would be a major setback for Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which have a sh=
ared interest in stabilizing Syria. Though Turkey is doing the heavy liftin=
g in Syria, instability in Jordan would be perilously close for Saudi Arabi=
a. Already <a href=3D"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/mailster/411755/5e270=
