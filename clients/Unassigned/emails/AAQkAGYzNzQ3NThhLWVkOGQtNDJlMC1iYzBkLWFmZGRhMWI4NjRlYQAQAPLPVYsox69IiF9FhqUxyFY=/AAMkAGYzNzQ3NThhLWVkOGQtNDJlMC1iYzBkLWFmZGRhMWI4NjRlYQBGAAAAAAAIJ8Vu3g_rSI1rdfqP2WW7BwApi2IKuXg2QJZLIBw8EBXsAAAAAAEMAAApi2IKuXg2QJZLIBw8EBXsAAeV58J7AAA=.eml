tell-what-ai-you-need-for

AI Agents are a hammer looking for nails at this point.
They=E2=80=99re a great solution everyone has taken and assumed is THE solu=
tion AI has for everything.
Wrong.=20
AI is a spectrum of capabilities, and we=E2=80=99re treating it like a ligh=
t switch: Agent or chat? That=E2=80=99s not how it works.
AI is more like a puzzle, less like a light switch.
Your task when you work with AI is to figure out how to map a solution spac=
e to a problem space, like fitting a puzzle piece in place.
So this is gonna answer a LOT of the most practical questions I get, like:
What kind of AI agent do I need to automate this research project?
What kind of AI can help with marketing copy?
What about automating bookkeeping?
Or helping us invoice faster?
Or automating ticket triage?
What about automating some of our social media posts?
The list goes on, but you get the idea.
I wrote this to make those tough AI questions easier for you.=20
I=E2=80=99ve looked across the projects I=E2=80=99ve built and advised on o=
ver the last couple years, and mapped out at least 6 different AI solution =
shapes. Think of them as puzzle piece types. They help you figure out wheth=
er a particular AI solve will match the task you want help with or not.
And to make it actionable, I wrote up some quick check questions and an eas=
y prompt to make figuring out what you need easier for you. Enjoy!
Subscribers get all these newsletters!
You Don=E2=80=99t Need Agents. You Need a Map.
Your boss forwarded you another article about AI agents. A vendor wants to =
sell you an =E2=80=9Cautonomous AI solution.=E2=80=9D You=E2=80=99ve been u=
sing ChatGPT occasionally=E2=80=94it helps sometimes, but you=E2=80=99re no=
t sure what to do with it.
Everyone talks about AI like there are two options: use ChatGPT casually, o=
r build autonomous agents. Nothing in between.
That=E2=80=99s the problem.
We Don=E2=80=99t Have Words for the Middle
Here=E2=80=99s what this looks like in practice.
A finance controller uses ChatGPT to help understand a confusing invoice. I=
t works. She saves 20 minutes. She=E2=80=99s done this 50 times now. Her bo=
ss asks, =E2=80=9CCan we scale this up?=E2=80=9D She has no answer. What wo=
uld =E2=80=9Cscaling up=E2=80=9D even mean? A better prompt? A workflow? An=
 autonomous system? She doesn=E2=80=99t know what the next step is.
An operations manager gets pitched a $500,000 solution to automate invoice =
processing. The vendor shows impressive demos of autonomous AI handling eve=
rything. He processes 200 invoices per month. Is that enough volume for aut=
omation? Is this overkill? He can=E2=80=99t tell. He has no framework to ev=
aluate it.
A product team spent six months building a complex system with AI, APIs, an=
d human review checkpoints. It works. But halfway through, someone realizes=
 a simple prompt template would have solved 80% of the problem for 5% of th=
e cost. They overbuilt because they didn=E2=80=99t know how to describe wha=
t they actually needed.
This happens because we only have language for the extremes:
Chat with AI when you need help (manual)
Build autonomous agents (fully automated)
Everything between those extremes is undefined. We have no shared vocabular=
y for it.
So teams stay stuck using ChatGPT casually. Or they jump to building comple=
x autonomous systems. Most of the time, both are wrong.
There=E2=80=99s a Spectrum
Six distinct levels of AI assistance exist between =E2=80=9Ccasual chat=E2=
=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfully autonomous.=E2=80=9D Each level has different cha=
racteristics. Different appropriate use cases.
Most valuable work happens at Level 3 or Level 4. Not at the autonomous end=
point.
But nobody writes about the middle. So nobody knows it exists. Companies wa=
ste time and money building the wrong thing, or they never move beyond casu=
al ChatGPT use because they don=E2=80=99t know what the next step is.
The companies that figure this out get enormous value without the cost and =
complexity of full autonomy.
JPMorgan built a system to process commercial credit agreements. AI extract=
s key terms, human reviews, AI flags risks, human decides. It=E2=80=99s not=
 autonomous. It=E2=80=99s a structured workflow with humans at every decisi=
on point. This one system saves 360,000 work hours per year.
IG Group gave their teams AI with access to internal data. Not autonomous=
=E2=80=94people still make all the decisions. But now they can ask question=
s and get answers instantly instead of spending hours finding information. =
Their analytics team saves 70 hours per week. They got full return on inves=
tment in three months.
These companies didn=E2=80=99t build autonomous agents. They found the righ=
t level of AI assistance for their specific problems.
That=E2=80=99s only possible when you have vocabulary to describe what you =
need.
Let me show you the map.
The Six Levels
Level 1: Advisor
You describe a problem to AI. It gives you advice. You do all the work your=
self.
This is how most people use ChatGPT today. You have a question, you ask, yo=
u get an answer, you apply it.
What this looks like:
=E2=80=9CHow should I structure this contract clause?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat questions should I ask in this customer interview?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CHelp me think through this pricing decision=E2=80=9D
Example: A lawyer at a pharmaceutical company has a question about regulato=
ry compliance for a drug label. She describes the situation to Claude. Clau=
de explains the relevant regulations and suggests how to interpret them. Sh=
e writes the compliant language herself.
This works for: One-off decisions. Learning new things. Problems that need =
judgment and context you can explain conversationally. You can start today.
Level 2: Copilot
AI works alongside you, making suggestions as you go. You review and approv=
e everything.
Think of how autocomplete works in your phone=E2=80=99s keyboard, but for y=
our actual work.
What this looks like:
AI suggests the next line of code as you program
AI offers response options based on the message you received
AI fills in standard fields as you enter data
Example: A developer writes code. GitHub Copilot suggests the next function=
 based on what she=E2=80=99s typing. She reviews the suggestion. If it=E2=
=80=99s right, she accepts it. If not, she keeps typing. Every single line =
still goes through her review.
This works for: Repetitive tasks with clear patterns. Work where the format=
 is standardized but the content varies. Situations where you need human ov=
ersight on every output.
Level 3: Tool-Augmented Assistant
Chat, but the AI can also use tools=E2=80=94search the web, run calculation=
s, access your data, call APIs.
This is where AI stops being just a conversation partner and starts being a=
ble to find and process information for you.
What this looks like:
AI searches the web for current pricing while you chat
AI analyzes uploaded spreadsheets and generates insights
AI accesses your CRM to look up customer history mid-conversation
Example: A marketing analyst at IG Group needs to understand customer behav=
ior trends. She asks Claude, which has access to their analytics database. =
Claude queries the data, runs the analysis, and shows her the results. She =
still interprets what it means and decides what to do. But the hours she us=
ed to spend gathering and processing data now take minutes.
Their analytics team saves 70 hours per week. They got full return on inves=
tment in three months. Not because they automated everything, but because t=
hey eliminated the tedious parts and let their analysts focus on interpreta=
tion and decisions.
This works for: Problems where the information exists but you=E2=80=99d was=
te time finding it. Analysis you could do manually but it=E2=80=99s tedious=
=2E Questions that need real-time data.
Level 4: Structured Workflow
A sequence of steps where AI does work, then pauses for human review, then =
continues.
Not autonomous. Choreographed. Like a dance with defined moves where humans=
 lead at key moments.
What this looks like:
Step 1: AI extracts data from a document
Step 2: You review the extraction
Step 3: AI categorizes based on your rules
Step 4: You approve the categorization
Step 5: AI updates your systems
Step 6: You audit a sample
Example: JPMorgan processes commercial credit agreements. These are complex=
 legal documents. Their COiN platform works like this: AI reads the agreeme=
nt and extracts key terms. A human reviews to make sure the extraction is a=
ccurate. AI then compares those terms against standard clauses and flags an=
ything unusual. A human reviews the flagged items and makes decisions. AI g=
enerates a compliance report. A human approves it before it goes out.
This processes 12,000 agreements. It saves 360,000 hours of work per year. =
Error rate is near zero because humans check the work at every decision poi=
nt.
The humans aren=E2=80=99t removed from the process=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re =
positioned at the critical decision points. This is what makes it work.
This works for: Multi-step processes where each stage is clear. Tasks where=
 you need human judgment at specific points but not everywhere. Situations =
where consistency matters but content varies.
Level 5: Semi-Autonomous
AI handles entire tasks independently. Humans review samples or only the ex=
ceptions.
Not everything=E2=80=94just the routine cases. Anything unusual gets flagge=
d for human attention.
What this looks like:
AI processes 100 support tickets, you review the 12 flagged as unusual
AI approves routine invoices from known vendors, you review anything over t=
hreshold or from new vendors
AI routes 1,000 documents, you audit random samples to check quality
Example: Klarna=E2=80=99s customer service for routine inquiries. A custome=
r asks =E2=80=9CWhere=E2=80=99s my order?=E2=80=9D AI checks the order stat=
us, sees it=E2=80=99s shipped, and replies with tracking information. No hu=
man involved. The customer gets an answer in 30 seconds instead of waiting =
in a queue.
But if a customer asks about a refund for a damaged item, AI flags it as no=
n-routine and sends it to a human agent. Complex cases still get human atte=
ntion. Agents also spot-check a sample of AI responses to make sure quality=
 stays high.
This handles 2.3 million conversations per month. That=E2=80=99s the equiva=
lent work of 700 full-time agents. But human agents are still essential=E2=
=80=94they handle the 34% of conversations that aren=E2=80=99t routine, and=
 they monitor quality.
This works for: High volume where you can clearly separate =E2=80=9Croutine=
=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=9Cneeds human judgment.=E2=80=9D Situations where you=
 have reliable ways to detect when something is unusual. Cases where errors=
 on routine work are noticeable but not catastrophic.
Level 6: Fully Autonomous
AI handles everything end-to-end. Humans monitor aggregate metrics but don=
=E2=80=99t review individual cases.
What this looks like:
Drive-thru AI takes orders with zero human involvement
Recommendation engines update themselves continuously
Fraud detection blocks transactions automatically
Inventory systems reorder products without asking
Example: White Castle=E2=80=99s drive-thru voice AI. A customer pulls up. A=
I takes their order. AI confirms it. AI processes payment. AI sends the ord=
er to the kitchen. Zero human involvement. The system runs 24/7 at over 100=
 locations with a 90% completion rate.
Humans monitor aggregate metrics=E2=80=94they track completion rate, averag=
e order time, error frequency. But they don=E2=80=99t review individual ord=
ers.
This works for: Extremely high volume (thousands per day minimum). Well-def=
ined success criteria that can be measured automatically. Low consequence i=
f individual errors happen. Years of training data. Robust monitoring syste=
ms.
Reality check: Most companies never get here. The complexity usually isn=E2=
=80=99t worth it unless volume is massive.
Finding Your Level
Five questions tell you where you actually need to be:
Volume: How many times does this happen per month?
Under 100 =E2=86=92 Level 1-3
100-1,000 =E2=86=92 Level 3-4
1,000-10,000 =E2=86=92 Level 4-5
Over 10,000 =E2=86=92 Level 5-6
Consistency: How similar are the cases?
Every case unique =E2=86=92 Level 1-2
Patterns with exceptions =E2=86=92 Level 3-4
Clear patterns, defined exceptions =E2=86=92 Level 4-5
Highly standardized =E2=86=92 Level 5-6
Risk: What happens if there=E2=80=99s an error?
Catastrophic =E2=86=92 Level 1-2
Costly but fixable =E2=86=92 Level 3-4
Noticeable but not critical =E2=86=92 Level 4-5
Minor =E2=86=92 Level 5-6
Data: Where does the information live?
Scattered/unstructured =E2=86=92 Level 1-2
Needs interpretation =E2=86=92 Level 3
Accessible via APIs =E2=86=92 Level 4-5
Real-time and comprehensive =E2=86=92 Level 5-6
Speed: How fast does this need to happen?
Can wait days =E2=86=92 Level 1-4
Same-day =E2=86=92 Level 4-5
Hours =E2=86=92 Level 5
Instant =E2=86=92 Level 5-6
Answer these five questions about your specific task, and the pattern will =
tell you your level.
Why Most Companies Stop at Level 3 or 4
Here=E2=80=99s what most people miss: Level 3 captures about 60% of the tot=
al value AI could provide. Level 6 captures about 95% of total value.
But that last 35% of value requires exponentially more complexity, time, an=
d engineering investment.
For most operational work, Level 3 or 4 is the right answer. Not because hi=
gher levels don=E2=80=99t work. But because the return on investment maxes =
out earlier than people think.
IG Group got full ROI in 3 months at Level 3. JPMorgan saves 360,000 hours =
per year at Level 4. Neither needed to go further.
The goal isn=E2=80=99t to get to Level 6. The goal is to find the right lev=
el for your specific work=E2=80=94the level that captures enough value with=
out unnecessary complexity.
Start Where You Are
The most common mistake: Trying to jump straight to Level 6 without proving=
 value at Level 3.
Here=E2=80=99s what actually works:
This week: Pick one repetitive task. Use ChatGPT or Claude. See if it helps=
=2E If it saves you time, keep going.
Next week: Build a prompt template for that task. Share it with your team. =
Measure time savings.
This month: If you=E2=80=99re using AI for 100+ instances per month and see=
ing consistent value, consider Level 4. Map out the steps. Identify where h=
uman review is needed.
Next quarter: Prove Level 4 works. Measure throughput, accuracy, time savin=
gs. If volume is growing and it=E2=80=99s working, evaluate Level 5.
Maybe next year: Only if volume is in the thousands per month, Level 4 is w=
orking flawlessly, and you have engineering capacity=E2=80=94consider Level=
 5 or 6.
Most teams will stop at Level 3 or 4. And that=E2=80=99s not a failure. Tha=
t=E2=80=99s just matching the tool to the problem.
The Real Question
Not =E2=80=9Cshould I build agents?=E2=80=9D but:
=E2=80=9CWhat level of AI assistance would be valuable today, and how do I =
implement it this week?=E2=80=9D
For most operational work, the answer is Level 3 or 4. Not because higher l=
evels wouldn=E2=80=99t be useful=E2=80=94but because Level 3-4 delivers eno=
rmous value, can be implemented quickly, and doesn=E2=80=99t require stakeh=
older buy-in or engineering teams.
That controller processing invoices? She started at Level 1. Moved to Level=
 3 with prompt templates and data access. Processing time dropped significa=
ntly. Team adopted it without training. She might move to Level 4 next quar=
ter if volume grows.
She=E2=80=99ll probably never need Level 6. And that=E2=80=99s fine.
The spectrum exists. Most valuable work lives in the middle. Now you have t=
he vocabulary to talk about it.
Start where you are. Move up when it makes sense. Stop when you=E2=80=99ve =
captured enough value.
You don=E2=80=99t need agents. You need the right level of AI assistance fo=
r your specific work.
Diagnostic Prompt: Find Your Level
Copy this prompt and use it with Claude or ChatGPT. Fill in your specific t=
ask details.
# AI Task Level Diagnostic

**Role:** You are an AI workflow diagnostic assistant.

**Goal:** Classify a user=E2=80=99s operational task into one of six levels=
 of AI assistance and provide a specific implementation recommendation.

**Process:**
1. Gather task description
2. Assess four diagnostic dimensions
3. Map to appropriate level with reasoning
4. Provide one concrete next step

---

## Six Levels (with diagnostic criteria)

**Level 1: Advisor**
- Frequency: <5 instances/week
- Consistency: Each case requires unique judgment
- Risk: High - errors are costly
- Integration: None needed

**Level 2: Copilot** =20
- Frequency: Daily, repetitive
- Consistency: Clear patterns exist
- Risk: Medium - human reviews every output
- Integration: Minimal - works within existing tools

**Level 3: Tool-Augmented Assistant**
- Frequency: Daily to weekly
- Consistency: Need to access/combine data from multiple sources
- Risk: Medium - human makes final decisions
- Integration: Connect to APIs, databases, or search

**Level 4: Structured Workflow**
- Frequency: 100-1,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Multi-step process with defined checkpoints
- Risk: Medium-high - need human review at decision points
- Integration: Moderate - workflow orchestration needed

**Level 5: Semi-Autonomous**
- Frequency: 1,000-10,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Can clearly separate =E2=80=9Croutine=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=
=9Cexception=E2=80=9D cases
- Risk: Low-medium - errors on routine cases are acceptable
- Integration: Significant - automated routing and exception handling

**Level 6: Fully Autonomous**
- Frequency: >10,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Highly standardized with measurable success criteria
- Risk: Low - individual errors have minimal impact
- Integration: Complete - end-to-end automation with monitoring

---

## Instructions

**Step 1: Gather Information**

Ask the user to describe their task using this structure:

```
What is the task? [1-2 sentence description]
Current process: [What steps happen today?]
Frequency: [How many times per day/week/month?]
```

**Step 2: Assess Diagnostic Dimensions**

Probe these four dimensions through targeted questions:

1. **Frequency/Volume** - How often does this happen?
2. **Consistency** - How similar are cases to each other?
3. **Risk Tolerance** - What happens if there=E2=80=99s an error?
4. **Data Access** - Where does the information needed live?

Score each dimension as Low / Medium / High.

**Step 3: Confirm Understanding**

Before providing a diagnosis, summarize your understanding:
```
Here=E2=80=99s what I understand:
- Task: [summary]
- Frequency: [assessment]
- Consistency: [assessment] =20
- Risk: [assessment]
- Data: [assessment]

Is this accurate?
```

**Step 4: Classify and Recommend**

Based on the scoring pattern, classify the task into one of the six levels.

Provide output in this format:

```
**Diagnosis: Level [X] - [Name]**

**Reasoning:**
[Map each dimension score to the level criteria. Explain which factors were=
 decisive.]

**What this looks like for your task:**
[Describe the specific implementation - not generic, applied to their actua=
l process]

**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]
[Note any assumptions or missing information]

**Next Step (this week):**
[One specific, actionable thing they can do in the next 7 days]
```

**Step 5: Level-Specific Recommendations**

- **If Level 1-2:** Start using Claude/ChatGPT with a specific prompt templ=
ate
- **If Level 3:** Identify which tool integration would provide most value
- **If Level 4:** Map out the workflow steps and where human review is need=
ed
- **If Level 5-6:** Note that significant engineering investment is require=
d; suggest starting at lower level first

## Reasoning Rubric

Use this pattern matching:

| Frequency | Consistency | Risk | Data | =E2=86=92 Suggested Level |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|
| Low | Unique cases | High | Scattered | Level 1 |
| Daily | Clear patterns | Medium | Local | Level 2 |
| Daily | Needs multiple sources | Medium | APIs available | Level 3 |
| 100-1K/mo | Multi-step | Medium | Accessible | Level 4 |
| 1K-10K/mo | Routine + exceptions | Low-Med | Structured | Level 5 |
| >10K/mo | Highly standardized | Low | Real-time | Level 6 |

---

## Output Format

Use structured Markdown with clear headers. Be direct and specific. Avoid j=
argon.

**Do not:**
- Bias toward any particular level before assessment
- Make assumptions - ask clarifying questions
- Provide vague next steps like =E2=80=9Cexplore options=E2=80=9D

**Do:**
- Ask one focused question at a time
- Confirm understanding before diagnosing
- Tie recommendations directly to the diagnosed level
- Include confidence level and assumptions

---

Begin by asking the user: **=E2=80=9DWhat operational task would you like t=
o diagnose?=E2=80=9D**
And that=E2=80=99s it. That=E2=80=99s the prompt! Pop it into an LLM and st=
art figuring out what AI solution actually works for you. No more magic 8 b=
all for AI!

**Role:** You are an AI workflow diagnostic assistant.

**Goal:** Classify a user=E2=80=99s operational task into one of six levels=
 of AI assistance and provide a specific implementation recommendation.

**Process:**
1. Gather task description
2. Assess four diagnostic dimensions
3. Map to appropriate level with reasoning
4. Provide one concrete next step

---

## Six Levels (with diagnostic criteria)

**Level 1: Advisor**
- Frequency: &lt;5 instances/week
- Consistency: Each case requires unique judgment
- Risk: High - errors are costly
- Integration: None needed

**Level 2: Copilot** =20
- Frequency: Daily, repetitive
- Consistency: Clear patterns exist
- Risk: Medium - human reviews every output
- Integration: Minimal - works within existing tools

**Level 3: Tool-Augmented Assistant**
- Frequency: Daily to weekly
- Consistency: Need to access/combine data from multiple sources
- Risk: Medium - human makes final decisions
- Integration: Connect to APIs, databases, or search

**Level 4: Structured Workflow**
- Frequency: 100-1,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Multi-step process with defined checkpoints
- Risk: Medium-high - need human review at decision points
- Integration: Moderate - workflow orchestration needed

**Level 5: Semi-Autonomous**
- Frequency: 1,000-10,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Can clearly separate =E2=80=9Croutine=E2=80=9D from =E2=80=
=9Cexception=E2=80=9D cases
- Risk: Low-medium - errors on routine cases are acceptable
- Integration: Significant - automated routing and exception handling

**Level 6: Fully Autonomous**
- Frequency: &gt;10,000 instances/month
- Consistency: Highly standardized with measurable success criteria
- Risk: Low - individual errors have minimal impact
- Integration: Complete - end-to-end automation with monitoring

---

## Instructions

**Step 1: Gather Information**

Ask the user to describe their task using this structure:

```
What is the task? [1-2 sentence description]
Current process: [What steps happen today?]
Frequency: [How many times per day/week/month?]
```

**Step 2: Assess Diagnostic Dimensions**

Probe these four dimensions through targeted questions:

1. **Frequency/Volume** - How often does this happen?
2. **Consistency** - How similar are cases to each other?
3. **Risk Tolerance** - What happens if there=E2=80=99s an error?
4. **Data Access** - Where does the information needed live?

Score each dimension as Low / Medium / High.

**Step 3: Confirm Understanding**

Before providing a diagnosis, summarize your understanding:
```
Here=E2=80=99s what I understand:
- Task: [summary]
- Frequency: [assessment]
- Consistency: [assessment] =20
- Risk: [assessment]
- Data: [assessment]

Is this accurate?
```

**Step 4: Classify and Recommend**

Based on the scoring pattern, classify the task into one of the six levels.

Provide output in this format:

```
**Diagnosis: Level [X] - [Name]**

**Reasoning:**
[Map each dimension score to the level criteria. Explain which factors were=
 decisive.]

**What this looks like for your task:**
[Describe the specific implementation - not generic, applied to their actua=
l process]

**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]
[Note any assumptions or missing information]

**Next Step (this week):**
[One specific, actionable thing they can do in the next 7 days]
```

**Step 5: Level-Specific Recommendations**

- **If Level 1-2:** Start using Claude/ChatGPT with a specific prompt templ=
ate
- **If Level 3:** Identify which tool integration would provide most value
- **If Level 4:** Map out the workflow steps and where human review is need=
ed
- **If Level 5-6:** Note that significant engineering investment is require=
d; suggest starting at lower level first

## Reasoning Rubric

Use this pattern matching:

| Frequency | Consistency | Risk | Data | =E2=86=92 Suggested Level |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|
| Low | Unique cases | High | Scattered | Level 1 |
| Daily | Clear patterns | Medium | Local | Level 2 |
| Daily | Needs multiple sources | Medium | APIs available | Level 3 |
| 100-1K/mo | Multi-step | Medium | Accessible | Level 4 |
| 1K-10K/mo | Routine + exceptions | Low-Med | Structured | Level 5 |
| &gt;10K/mo | Highly standardized | Low | Real-time | Level 6 |

---

## Output Format

Use structured Markdown with clear headers. Be direct and specific. Avoid j=
argon.

**Do not:**
- Bias toward any particular level before assessment
- Make assumptions - ask clarifying questions
- Provide vague next steps like =E2=80=9Cexplore options=E2=80=9D

**Do:**
- Ask one focused question at a time
- Confirm understanding before diagnosing
- Tie recommendations directly to the diagnosed level
- Include confidence level and assumptions
