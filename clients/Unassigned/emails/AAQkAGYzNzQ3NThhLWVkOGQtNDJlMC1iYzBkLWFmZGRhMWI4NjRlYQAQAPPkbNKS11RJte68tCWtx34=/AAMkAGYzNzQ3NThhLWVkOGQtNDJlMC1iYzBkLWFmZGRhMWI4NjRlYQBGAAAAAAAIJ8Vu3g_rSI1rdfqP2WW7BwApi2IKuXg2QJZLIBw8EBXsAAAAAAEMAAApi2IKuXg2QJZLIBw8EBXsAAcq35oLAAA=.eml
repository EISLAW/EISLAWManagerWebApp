ISRAEL’S DRUZE POLICY AND DISMANTLING OF SYRIA [3]
NETANYAHU IS EXPLOITING THE WEAKNESS OF THE DAMASCUS REGIME AND ITS LACK OF CONTROL OVER LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.
BY: HILAL KHASHAN
Since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime last December, Israel has carried out more than 500 airstrikes to prevent the former regime's weapons from reaching the new Syrian authorities, whom it
describes as jihadists. Israel also took control of the demilitarized zone in the Syrian Golan Heights, including the strategic summit of Mount Hermon. In southern Syria, Israeli forces have advanced
to less than 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the derelict Mezzeh air base, southeast of Damascus' old sector. The Israeli military said it was deployed in southern Syria to prevent enemy forces from
entering areas inhabited by the Druze minority. Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened more than two months ago to intervene militarily if the new Syrian government harmed the Druze, who comprise 3
percent of Syria’s population (and about half that share of the Israeli population).
This commitment was put to the test at the end of April, when sectarian clashes erupted in the suburbs of Damascus after an audio recording attributed to a Druze man surfaced online that included
insults of the Prophet Muhammad. Israel responded with what officials described as cautionary strikes against government security forces in a mostly Druze town on the capital’s outskirts. The
sectarian violence largely ended a short time later, having left more than 100 dead in two days. Nevertheless, two days later, Israeli warplanes conducted massive airstrikes against Syrian military
targets, including an area adjacent to the presidential palace in Damascus. Announcing the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge to protect the Druze community.
The Israeli claim to defend the Druze seems to conceal a deeper agenda aimed at redrawing the Syrian map, part of Netanyahu’s vow on Oct. 8, 2023, to transform the Middle East. Hours before the more
recent Israeli bombing, Druze religious authorities and military factions rejected secession and affirmed that they are an integral part of Syria. They also endorsed the government’s activation of
the Interior Ministry and judicial police in Sweida province, a stronghold of the Druze community, to ensure public security and stability. Sweida’s governor confirmed their appeals for civil peace
and rejection of violence.
SEEING BEYOND THE DRUZE
Israel seems to be operating under the assumption that dismantling Syria – which Israel’s finance minister listed as one of the country’s goals several days before the belated bombing – would
shield Israel from its adversaries, ending the more than century-old conflict with Arabs. Netanyahu also fears that inaction would leave Syria’s fate to be decided by Turkey, a key ally of the new
Syrian regime, but wants to avoid a direct conflict with Ankara.

Israel is exploiting the weakness of the Syrian regime and its lack of control over large areas, including the Alawite-dominated coast, regions controlled by Turkey and the Kurds in the north, and the
Bedouin areas in the southeast. It is operating in southern Syria because this region is not a priority for Damascus at the moment, enabling Israel to impose a new reality on the ground. Eventually,
it hopes to encourage the Alawites and Ismailis, not to mention the Kurds, to form their own entities as part of Netanyahu's plan to remake the region.
Israel’s long-standing involvement with the Druze community, dating to the country’s formation in 1948, supports this endeavor. Israel believes it can foster a separatist Druze identity within
Syria with the help of Druze Israeli leaders, given their ability to communicate directly with the Druze in Syria. By emphasizing the blood alliance between the Jewish state and the Druze, Israel
seeks to consolidate its permanent presence in southern Syria.
TERRORISM CHARGE
Israel’s opportunity to intervene directly in Syria came immediately after the collapse of Assad’s regime in December. As part of its effort to undermine the new government in Damascus, Netanyahu
has repeatedly accused Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, of leading terrorist organizations bent on Israel’s destruction. But although al-Sharaa’s former group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is a
jihadist movement, its ambitions are not transnational – as Israel well knows.
The 1967 Six-Day War served as a watershed in the ideological orientation of Islamic jihadism. Before the war, transnational movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Liberation Party
operated in many Arab and Muslim countries with the goal of resurrecting the caliphate state, which was dismantled after the Ottoman Empire's collapse in 1918. After the 1967 war, emerging Islamic
movements focused on the near enemy – i.e., the corrupt national political system – aiming to topple it and build a sharia-guided political system in its ruins. (Al-Qaida was probably the only
exception. Osama bin Laden turned against the U.S. after the 1990 Gulf War. It was not that bin Laden supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait – he proposed forming an Islamic army to drive out the
Iraqis and reinstate Kuwait's independence – but he viewed the stationing of more than half a million U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia as an insult to the Islamic purity of the Arabian Peninsula.)
“Hayat Tahrir al-Sham” translates as “Organization for the Liberation of Greater Syria.” It never targeted Israel or Western interests. In fact, Israel used to treat its wounded in southwest
Syria before its expulsion and confinement to Idlib in northwestern Syria in 2016. Even the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (a reference to Greater Syria) had no interest in targeting Israel,
preferring instead to focus on the Syrian government and competing Islamic movements.
SYRIA'S IDENTITY CRISIS
Although they now lead the government in Damascus, the “liberation” of the Levant remains the end goal for al-Sharaa and his comrades. Geographically and demographically, Syria and Iraq form a
single unit – the Fertile Crescent. They were united from the dawn of history until Britain and France carved the region into areas of influence with the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, with the
former claiming Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan and the latter Syria and Lebanon. This division, formalized by the 1920 San Remo Conference, was arbitrary and illogical, intended to shatter the hopes
of the region’s inhabitants of forming a modern state.
Arabs in both Syria and Iraq opposed the arrangement. In 1919, Faisal bin Hussein, leader of the Arab delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, rejected the Treaty of Versailles and demanded the
implementation of the King-Crane Commission’s recommendations. Authorized by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to survey local opinion, the commission called for establishing an Arab state in Greater
Syria and restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine, citing Arabs’ categorical rejection of a Jewish state in Palestine.
In March 1920, the Syrian National Congress declared the birth of the Arab Kingdom of Syria and appointed Faisal as its king. His Advisory Council in Damascus included members from all of Syria's
natural regions as well as Iraq, such as Nuri Pasha al-Said, Taha Pasha al-Hashimi and Yassin Pasha al-Hashimi. However, four months later, French forces defeated his army at the Battle of Maysalun.
Faisal fled to London, and in 1921 the British installed him as king of Iraq.
Immediately after his coronation, King Faisal I adopted a rigorous pan-Arab policy that extended beyond West Asia to include Egypt and the Maghreb region. He entrusted Sati al-Husri, whom he appointed
minister of education, to formulate a doctrine of Arab nationalism. He also sought to unite Syria and Iraq, but Britain and France blocked all attempts until his death in 1933. His son Ghazi succeeded
him. A staunch pan-Arabist, King Ghazi drew close to Germany, which gifted him a radio station that he used to broadcast anti-British political commentaries and promote unification between Iraq and
Syria. Alarmed by the threat to British interests, Ambassador Maurice Patterson urged Britain to control or depose him. On April 4, 1939, the Iraqi government announced Ghazi’s death in a car
accident, though many Iraqis believe the British orchestrated his killing.
In the 1940s and 1950s, unity between Iraq and the Levant was a pivotal issue for both domestic politics and the region. After Egypt signed the Camp David Accords in 1978, the Baathist regimes in
Syria and Iraq attempted to unify. However, their presidents – both of whom hailed from the ruling minority sects in their respective countries (Sunni Saddam Hussein and Alawite Hafez Assad) –
pursued narrow personal politics that derailed talks. Nevertheless, the dream of a united Iraq and Syria resides permanently in the collective consciousness of most Iraqis and Syrians.
ISRAEL’S DILEMMA
When Theodor Herzl published “The Jewish State” pamphlet in 1896, advocating a sovereign Jewish homeland to protect Jews from European antisemitism and rejection, he viewed Palestine as the ideal
place to ensure the Jewish people's security. Frequent attacks on Jewish immigrants by Palestinians led Zeev Jabotinsky and Eliyahu Golomb to establish the Haganah, a Jewish self-defense organization
in 1920. The following year, large-scale anti-Jewish riots in Jaffa initiated a spate of mutual violence that still has not subsided, even after the founding of the Jewish state in May 1948. The fact
that Israel has not enjoyed security after more than three-quarters of a century of existence raises fundamental questions that lie outside the scope of this essay.
The day after Hamas launched its massive Oct. 7 attack, Netanyahu said Israel would transform the Middle East by the time the war ends. However, there is no guarantee that such a transformation will
enhance Israel's security. Israel's present approach to regional peace assumes that resolution must be zero-sum and that Israel has won, but for Arabs – just as much as for Israelis – this is a
battle of identities. In such a conflict, victory is elusive even in the long run.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Since the fall of =
Bashar Assad=E2=80=99s regime last December, Israel has carried out more th=
an 500 airstrikes to prevent the former regime's weapons from reaching the =
new Syrian authorities, whom it describes as jihadists. Israel also took co=
ntrol of the demilitarized zone in the Syrian Golan Heights, including the =
strategic summit of Mount Hermon. In southern Syria, Israeli forces have ad=
vanced to less than 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the derelict Mezzeh air=
 base, southeast of Damascus' old sector. The Israeli military said it was =
deployed in southern Syria to prevent enemy forces from entering areas inha=
bited by the Druze minority. Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened more t=
han two months ago to intervene militarily if the new Syrian government har=
med the Druze, who comprise 3 percent of Syria=E2=80=99s population (and ab=
out half that share of the Israeli population).</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">This commitment wa=
s put to the test at the end of April, when sectarian clashes erupted in th=
e suburbs of Damascus after an audio recording attributed to a Druze man su=
rfaced online that included insults of the Prophet Muhammad. Israel respond=
ed with what officials described as cautionary strikes against government s=
ecurity forces in a mostly Druze town on the capital=E2=80=99s outskirts. T=
he sectarian violence largely ended a short time later, having left more th=
an 100 dead in two days. Nevertheless, two days later, Israeli warplanes co=
nducted massive airstrikes against Syrian military targets, including an ar=
ea adjacent to the presidential palace in Damascus. Announcing the strikes,=
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge to protect=
 the Druze community.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The Israeli claim =
to defend the Druze seems to conceal a deeper agenda aimed at redrawing the=
 Syrian map, part of Netanyahu=E2=80=99s vow on Oct. 8, 2023, to transform =
the Middle East. Hours before the more recent Israeli bombing, Druze religi=
ous authorities and military factions rejected secession and affirmed that =
they are an integral part of Syria. They also endorsed the government=E2=80=
=99s activation of the Interior Ministry and judicial police in Sweida prov=
ince, a stronghold of the Druze community, to ensure public security and st=
ability. Sweida=E2=80=99s governor confirmed their appeals for civil peace =
and rejection of violence.</p>

ond the Druze</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel seems to be=
 operating under the assumption that dismantling Syria =E2=80=93 which Isra=
el=E2=80=99s finance minister listed as one of the country=E2=80=99s goals =
several days before the belated bombing =E2=80=93 would shield Israel from =
its adversaries, ending the more than century-old conflict with Arabs. Neta=
nyahu also fears that inaction would leave Syria=E2=80=99s fate to be decid=
ed by Turkey, a key ally of the new Syrian regime, but wants to avoid a dir=
ect conflict with Ankara.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel is exploiti=
ng the weakness of the Syrian regime and its lack of control over large are=
as, including the Alawite-dominated coast, regions controlled by Turkey and=
 the Kurds in the north, and the Bedouin areas in the southeast. It is oper=
ating in southern Syria because this region is not a priority for Damascus =
at the moment, enabling Israel to impose a new reality on the ground. Event=
ually, it hopes to encourage the Alawites and Ismailis, not to mention the =
Kurds, to form their own entities as part of Netanyahu's plan to remake the=
 region.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s l=
ong-standing involvement with the Druze community, dating to the country=E2=
=80=99s formation in 1948, supports this endeavor. Israel believes it can f=
oster a separatist Druze identity within Syria with the help of Druze Israe=
li leaders, given their ability to communicate directly with the Druze in S=
yria. By emphasizing the blood alliance between the Jewish state and the Dr=
uze, Israel seeks to consolidate its permanent presence in southern Syria.<=

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Terrorism =
Charge</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Israel=E2=80=99s o=
pportunity to intervene directly in Syria came immediately after the collap=
se of Assad=E2=80=99s regime in December. As part of its effort to undermin=
e the new government in Damascus, Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Syria=E2=
=80=99s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, of leading terrorist organizations bent=
 on Israel=E2=80=99s destruction. But although al-Sharaa=E2=80=99s former g=
roup, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is a jihadist movement, its ambitions are not t=
ransnational =E2=80=93 as Israel well knows.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The 1967 Six-Day W=
ar served as a watershed in the ideological orientation of Islamic jihadism=
. Before the war, transnational movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood an=
d the Islamic Liberation Party operated in many Arab and Muslim countries w=
ith the goal of resurrecting the caliphate state, which was dismantled afte=
r the Ottoman Empire's collapse in 1918. After the 1967 war, emerging Islam=
ic movements focused on the near enemy =E2=80=93 i.e., the corrupt national=
 political system =E2=80=93 aiming to topple it and build a sharia-guided p=
olitical system in its ruins. (Al-Qaida was probably the only exception. Os=
ama bin Laden turned against the U.S. after the 1990 Gulf War. It was not t=
hat bin Laden supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait =E2=80=93 he proposed for=
ming an Islamic army to drive out the Iraqis and reinstate Kuwait's indepen=
dence =E2=80=93 but he viewed the stationing of more than half a million U.=
S. troops in Saudi Arabia as an insult to the Islamic purity of the Arabian=
 Peninsula.)</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">=E2=80=9CHayat Tah=
rir al-Sham=E2=80=9D translates as =E2=80=9COrganization for the Liberation=
 of Greater Syria.=E2=80=9D It never targeted Israel or Western interests. =
In fact, Israel used to treat its wounded in southwest Syria before its exp=
ulsion and confinement to Idlib in northwestern Syria in 2016. Even the Isl=
amic State in Iraq and the Levant (a reference to Greater Syria) had no int=
erest in targeting Israel, preferring instead to focus on the Syrian govern=
ment and competing Islamic movements.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Syria's Id=
entity Crisis</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Although they now =
lead the government in Damascus, the =E2=80=9Cliberation=E2=80=9D of the Le=
vant remains the end goal for al-Sharaa and his comrades. Geographically an=
d demographically, Syria and Iraq form a single unit =E2=80=93 the Fertile =
Crescent. They were united from the dawn of history until Britain and Franc=
e carved the region into areas of influence with the Sykes-Picot Agreement =
of 1916, with the former claiming Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan and the l=
atter Syria and Lebanon. This division, formalized by the 1920 San Remo Con=
ference, was arbitrary and illogical, intended to shatter the hopes of the =
region=E2=80=99s inhabitants of forming a modern state.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Arabs in both Syri=
a and Iraq opposed the arrangement. In 1919, Faisal bin Hussein, leader of =
the Arab delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, rejected the Treaty of V=
ersailles and demanded the implementation of the King-Crane Commission=E2=
=80=99s recommendations. Authorized by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to sur=
vey local opinion, the commission called for establishing an Arab state in =
Greater Syria and restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine, citing Arabs=
=E2=80=99 categorical rejection of a Jewish state in Palestine.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In March 1920, the=
 Syrian National Congress declared the birth of the Arab Kingdom of Syria a=
nd appointed Faisal as its king. His Advisory Council in Damascus included =
members from all of Syria's natural regions as well as Iraq, such as Nuri P=
asha al-Said, Taha Pasha al-Hashimi and Yassin Pasha al-Hashimi. However, f=
our months later, French forces defeated his army at the Battle of Maysalun=
. Faisal fled to London, and in 1921 the British installed him as king of I=
raq.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Immediately after =
his coronation, King Faisal I adopted a rigorous pan-Arab policy that exten=
ded beyond West Asia to include Egypt and the Maghreb region. He entrusted =
Sati al-Husri, whom he appointed minister of education, to formulate a doct=
rine of Arab nationalism. He also sought to unite Syria and Iraq, but Brita=
in and France blocked all attempts until his death in 1933. His son Ghazi s=
ucceeded him. A staunch pan-Arabist, King Ghazi drew close to Germany, whic=
h gifted him a radio station that he used to broadcast anti-British politic=
al commentaries and promote unification between Iraq and Syria. Alarmed by =
the threat to British interests, Ambassador Maurice Patterson urged Britain=
 to control or depose him. On April 4, 1939, the Iraqi government announced=
 Ghazi=E2=80=99s death in a car accident, though many Iraqis believe the Br=
itish orchestrated his killing.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In the 1940s and 1=
950s, unity between Iraq and the Levant was a pivotal issue for both domest=
ic politics and the region. After Egypt signed the Camp David Accords in 19=
78, the Baathist regimes in Syria and Iraq attempted to unify. However, the=
ir presidents =E2=80=93 both of whom hailed from the ruling minority sects =
in their respective countries (Sunni Saddam Hussein and Alawite Hafez Assad=
) =E2=80=93 pursued narrow personal politics that derailed talks. Neverthel=
ess, the dream of a united Iraq and Syria resides permanently in the collec=
tive consciousness of most Iraqis and Syrians.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Israel=E2=
=80=99s Dilemma</strong></p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">When Theodor Herzl=
 published =E2=80=9CThe Jewish State=E2=80=9D pamphlet in 1896, advocating =
a sovereign Jewish homeland to protect Jews from European antisemitism and =
rejection, he viewed Palestine as the ideal place to ensure the Jewish peop=
le's security. Frequent attacks on Jewish immigrants by Palestinians led Ze=
ev Jabotinsky and Eliyahu Golomb to establish the Haganah, a Jewish self-de=
fense organization in 1920. The following year, large-scale anti-Jewish rio=
ts in Jaffa initiated a spate of mutual violence that still has not subside=
d, even after the founding of the Jewish state in May 1948. The fact that I=
srael has not enjoyed security after more than three-quarters of a century =
of existence raises fundamental questions that lie outside the scope of thi=
s essay.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The day after Hama=
s launched its massive Oct. 7 attack, Netanyahu said Israel would transform=
 the Middle East by the time the war ends. However, there is no guarantee t=
hat such a transformation will enhance Israel's security. Israel's present =
approach to regional peace assumes that resolution must be zero-sum and tha=
t Israel has won, but for Arabs =E2=80=93 just as much as for Israelis =E2=
=80=93 this is a battle of identities. In such a conflict, victory is elusi=
ve even in the long run.</p>
