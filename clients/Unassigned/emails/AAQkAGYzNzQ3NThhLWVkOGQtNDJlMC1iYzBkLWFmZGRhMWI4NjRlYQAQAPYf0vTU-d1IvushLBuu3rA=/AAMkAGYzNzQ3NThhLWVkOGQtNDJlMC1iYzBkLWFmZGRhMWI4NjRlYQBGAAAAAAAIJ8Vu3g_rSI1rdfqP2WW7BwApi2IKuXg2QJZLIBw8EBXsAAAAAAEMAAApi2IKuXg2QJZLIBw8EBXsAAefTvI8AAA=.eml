DAILY MEMO: US TO WITHDRAW SOME TROOPS FROM ROMANIA [3]
IT'S PART OF A BROADER PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN EUROPE.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
DOWNSIZING. The U.S. plans to withdraw 800 soldiers stationed in Romania, according to Romanian officials [4], as part of a broader restructuring of its forces in Europe. U.S. officials reportedly
informed NATO allies of the decision in a recent meeting, reassuring them that around 1,000 U.S. troops (in addition to aircraft, drones and other assets) would remain at Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base.
Relatedly, the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division took over [5] command of the U.S. mission in Romania on Monday. In a ceremony at Mihail Kogalniceanu, the unit replaced the 1st Armored Division to
become an integral part of NATO’s eastern flank defense and America's forward presence in the Black Sea region. It will lead a task force of about 3,000 soldiers on a nine-month deployment,
spearheading missions across Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
SANCTIONS FALLOUT. India’s largest oil refiner, Indian Oil Corp., said [6] it will not stop purchasing Russian oil despite new U.S. sanctions targeting major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil.
According to the company’s chief financial officer, the firm plans to comply with international sanctions and will source crude from non-sanctioned Russian suppliers. However, according to Reuters
[7], many Indian refineries have already suspended new orders for Russian oil following the U.S. announcement of the sanctions last week.
CHINESE PURCHASES. Shandong Yulong Petrochemical, China’s newest refinery, has increased [8] its purchases of Russian oil after being placed earlier this month on an expanded list of sanctioned
companies by the U.K. and the EU. The refinery, which is running at 90 percent capacity, has ordered upward of 350,000 barrels per day of Russian oil for November. It has a total processing capacity
of 400,000 bpd.
FRAGILE CEASEFIRE. Israel reportedly plans [9] to expand its control of the Gaza Strip beyond the so-called yellow line. The decision was made after the Israeli government on Tuesday accused Hamas of
attacking Israeli soldiers in the city of Rafah and violating its agreement to return the bodies of Israeli hostages. In response to the Rafah clashes, Israel conducted [10] a wave of airstrikes on
Gaza on Tuesday night but said Wednesday it would resume its compliance with the ceasefire deal.
RUSSIA AND VENEZUELA. More than 500 business leaders are participating [11] in a Russia-Venezuela business forum in Caracas this week. The event will focus on nine strategic areas of bilateral
cooperation: industry, finance, mining, transport, tourism, education, agriculture, technology and hydrocarbons. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro described it as a sign of enhanced relations with
Moscow.
CLASHES IN BRAZIL. Brazilian police raided [12] a series of residential complexes in the favelas of northern Rio de Janeiro in search of members of the Comando Vermelho gang. At least 64 people were
killed in the operation, which involved 2,500 officers and special forces and led to members of the gang opening fire, setting barricades ablaze and using armed drones to drop explosives on special
forces units. The regional governor said [13] it was the largest police operation in the region since 2010 and declared that the city was “at war.”
LIBYA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS. Libyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid Dbeibah met [14] with representatives of U.S. energy giant Chevron. They discussed plans to expand the company’s activities in the
country. Oil and Gas Minister Khalifa Abdel Sadiq and the head of the Libyan National Oil Co. also participated in the talks. Last week, the head of the armed forces of eastern Libya, Khalifa Haftar,
met [15] in Athens with the Greek defense minister and the chief of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff. Though the Greek government did not issue any official statements on the talks, the
Libyan contingent said they discussed ways to expand military cooperation and strengthen coordination on security and defense issues.
RUSSIA AND SYRIA. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov met [16] with his Syrian counterpart, Murhaf Abu Qasra, in Moscow. Belousov noted that he had spoken with Qasra previously, during a recent
meeting between the two countries’ presidents, also in Moscow. He said the talks were “meaningful” and had “great potential.”
PYONGYANG MAKES A STATEMENT. North Korea announced [17] that it test-fired sea-to-surface strategic cruise missiles in the Yellow Sea on Tuesday, hours before U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to
South Korea for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The launch was reported by the official Korean Central News Agency but not by state media focused on domestic audiences.
IRANIAN MEDIATION. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met [18] in Tehran with Pakistan’s interior minister. Pezeshkian said his country was ready to help resolve Pakistan’s differences with its
neighbor, Afghanistan, amid recent clashes.
