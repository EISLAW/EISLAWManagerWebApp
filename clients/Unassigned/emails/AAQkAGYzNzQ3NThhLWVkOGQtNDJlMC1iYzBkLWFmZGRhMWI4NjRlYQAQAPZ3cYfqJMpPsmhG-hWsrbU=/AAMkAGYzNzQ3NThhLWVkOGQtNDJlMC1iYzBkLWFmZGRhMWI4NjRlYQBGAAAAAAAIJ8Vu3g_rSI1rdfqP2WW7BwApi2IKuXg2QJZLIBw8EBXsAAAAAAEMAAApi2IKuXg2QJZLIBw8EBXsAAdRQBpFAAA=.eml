DAILY MEMO: UNPRECEDENTED TAIWAN DRILLS, US CUTS SOME UKRAINE ARMS SHIPMENTS [3]
TAIWAN'S LARGEST-EVER DRILLS WILL SIMULATE A CHINESE BLOCKADE AND INVASION.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
SIMULATED INVASION. Taiwan will conduct its largest military exercises [4] in history next week, simulating a Chinese blockade and invasion of the island. More than 22,000 reservists will participate
in the 10-day drills beginning July 9. Military officials said scenarios will include a “joint fire attack” and a simulated amphibious assault by the People’s Liberation Army. Taiwan’s forces
will practice precision attacks from both air and sea.
DEPLETED STOCKS. The United States is halting certain weapons shipments to Ukraine [5] that had been promised by the Biden administration. The Pentagon did not specify which systems are affected but
cited concerns over depleted U.S. stockpiles. In Kyiv, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa invited the acting U.S. charge d'affaires, John Hinkel, to the Foreign Ministry, where she warned
that delays in defense assistance [6] would “only encourage the aggressor to continue its war and terror rather than seek peace.” The ministry emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine’s
military capacity and coordinate greater trans-Atlantic pressure on Russia.
FRANCE AND RUSSIA. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone on Tuesday, their first conversation in nearly three years. According to the Kremlin [7], the
two discussed the Israel-Iran war and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Both leaders reaffirmed the importance of respecting Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear development under the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and urged Tehran’s continued cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Kremlin said. Additionally, Putin blamed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the
West, which he said had ignored Russian security concerns and fostered an “anti-Russian bridgehead” in Ukraine. Immediately after the call, Macron called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
and shared the details of his conversation [8] with Putin.
SHORTAGE OF YOUTH. Ukraine is facing a growing social crisis [9] due to the mass emigration of young people, particularly school-age children and university students, according to the investigative
outlet NGL.media. At the start of the 2024-25 school year, only 3.74 million students remained in Ukraine’s education system, the lowest figure in 30 years. The report estimates that about 720,000
Ukrainian schoolchildren are now studying abroad. The trend is expected to accelerate, as young men seek to avoid conscription and women pursue better opportunities overseas. This outflow threatens
not only higher education but also the future labor market.
AZERBAIJAN AND RUSSIA. Relations between Moscow and Baku have deteriorated thanks to the arrest of eight Russian nationals on charges of drug trafficking and cybercrimes and the detention of two
Russian Sputnik journalists. Russia’s Investigative Committee is coordinating [10] with Azerbaijan’s prosecutor general, and the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the Azerbaijani ambassador,
demanding the journalists’ immediate release. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of trying to destabilize Russia’s relationship with Azerbaijan and said Russia would defend its
citizens [11] through all available diplomatic channels. Similarly, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova emphasized the strategic value of the bilateral relationship [12] and implied
that the crackdown on Sputnik were politically motivated. However, the frictions may stem partly from Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian oil refineries that processed Azerbaijani crude [13].
FOR SALE. Russia is considering the sale of a 49 percent stake in the Akkuyu nuclear power plant [14] in Turkey, a $25 billion project managed by a Rosatom subsidiary. Investor interest is reportedly
rising ahead of the launch of the plant’s first reactor. A previous attempt to sell shares in 2018 failed.
TURKEY AND KURDS. Turkey’s intelligence chief, Ibrahim Kalin, visited Erbil for talks with Kurdish political leaders [15]. Discussions focused on the regional fallout from the Iran-Israel war,
counterterrorism efforts, and the security and political inclusion of Iraqi Turkmen. Meanwhile, Turkish officials, Iraqi federal authorities and the Kurdistan Regional Government continue to work
together to monitor the disarmament of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The first group of 50 PKK militants reportedly will begin disarming [16] in the next several days.
HELP WANTED. Israel has urged China to use its economic and political leverage [17] to curb Iran’s military and nuclear ambitions. Oil revenues fund Iran’s destabilizing activities across the
region, Israel’s consul-general in Shanghai said, adding that Iran would “collapse” if China stopped buying its oil. China buys approximately 90 percent of the oil that Iran exports.
Additionally, a 2021 strategic partnership agreement between Tehran and Beijing includes up to $400 billion in Chinese investments over 25 years.
QUAD UNITY. The top diplomats from the U.S., Japan, India and Australia met for the second time this year and announced the launch of the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative [18], aimed at securing and
diversifying mineral supply chains in response to China’s export controls. Separately, Japan postponed a scheduled ministerial meeting with the U.S. after Washington demanded increased defense
spending and apparently issued new threats in ongoing trade talks. U.S. President Donald Trump said a U.S.-Japan trade deal was unlikely before his self-imposed July 9 deadline and floated raising
tariffs on Japanese goods [19] to 30-35 percent.
RISKY INVITATION. China has invited [20] South Korean President Lee Jae-myung to attend its upcoming military parade in September, marking the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan in World War II.
Seoul is “reviewing” the invitation, according to South Korean state media.
