just-laid-off-30000-peoplebut

Amazon dropped 30,000 people this week, and every headline I=E2=80=99ve rea=
d tells the exact same story: your job is next, AI is taking over, welcome =
to the future.
The coverage has been relentless. Article after article explaining how Amaz=
on is =E2=80=9Cembracing automation=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Crestructuring for=
 an AI-first world=E2=80=9D and how this is just the beginning of mass job =
displacement across every industry. The media is absolutely in love with th=
is narrative.
And look, I get it. It=E2=80=99s a compelling story. It=E2=80=99s scary. It=
 fits the moment.
But it=E2=80=99s wrong.
Not wrong because layoffs aren=E2=80=99t brutal. They absolutely are. But w=
rong about why this happened. And the gap between what actually happened an=
d what everyone=E2=80=99s reporting reveals something important about how w=
e=E2=80=99re all thinking about AI right now.
So let me walk you through what=E2=80=99s really going on. Because I spent =
years at Amazon, and I know exactly how this company makes decisions about =
money.
Subscribers get all these newsletters!    =20
Grab the prompt to read the next AI story [ https://substack.com/redirect/e=
5e4750c-6c75-4cf2-bfff-e4f1006cc0a0?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf=
9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
I=E2=80=99ll link it and talk about it down below, but if you want to get t=
he prompt that will help you decode future AI claims, it=E2=80=99s right he=
re. In fact, there=E2=80=99s two of them! One for Perplexity to do research=
, one for ChatGPT or another reasoner model to think through the real story=
 with you.
The AWS Problem Everyone=E2=80=99s Ignoring
First thing you need to know: Amazon doesn=E2=80=99t actually make money se=
lling you stuff.
I know that sounds crazy. You think =E2=80=9CAmazon=E2=80=9D and you think =
of the everything store, the cardboard boxes showing up on your doorstep, t=
he retail empire. But retail margins are terrible. Amazon could sell twice =
as much stuff tomorrow and it wouldn=E2=80=99t move the needle on profitabi=
lity.
The actual money comes from AWS. The cloud computing business is the whole =
game. Every quarter, Wall Street looks at exactly one number: AWS growth ra=
te. That number is everything.
And right now? That number is headed in the wrong direction.
AWS growth has been decelerating for years. They=E2=80=99re down to 18% yea=
r-over-year, and while that still sounds impressive, Wall Street hates the =
trend. Especially because Azure and Google Cloud have been closing the gap =
fast, powered almost entirely by AI infrastructure.
When companies want to build AI products today, they=E2=80=99re thinking ab=
out Azure. They=E2=80=99re thinking about Google Cloud. AWS has fallen to a=
 distant third place in the race that matters most for their future.
So Amazon has a problem. They need to prove they=E2=80=99re still serious a=
bout AI. And to do that, they need Nvidia GPUs. Lots of them, and they need=
 them now.
These aren=E2=80=99t normal chips. Each one costs about as much as a decent=
 car. And to compete at scale in AI infrastructure, you need thousands upon=
 thousands of them.
But here=E2=80=99s where it gets interesting from a finance perspective: Am=
azon can=E2=80=99t afford to let this GPU investment damage AWS margins. Th=
ose margins are literally the only reason the company has its current valua=
tion.
So you=E2=80=99ve got a massive capital expenditure problem. You need to bu=
y an enormous amount of expensive hardware, but you can=E2=80=99t let it hu=
rt your margins.
What do you do?
You cut somewhere else. And the biggest line item you can cut is salaries.
Amazon=E2=80=99s Real Problem: They Need GPUs. Now
Amazon didn=E2=80=99t lay off 30,000 people because AI was already doing th=
eir jobs. They laid off 30,000 people because they needed the cash right no=
w to buy GPUs and catch up in the AI cloud race.
That=E2=80=99s the whole story.
Now obviously, that doesn=E2=80=99t sound great from a PR perspective. So i=
nstead, Amazon positions it as forward-thinking efficiency gains through AI=
 automation. And tech journalists, who generally don=E2=80=99t understand e=
nterprise cloud economics, run with it.
But anyone who=E2=80=99s actually worked inside Amazon (and I have) knows t=
hat=E2=80=99s not reality. The internal systems are not some gleaming autom=
ated wonderland. They=E2=80=99re held together with duct tape and manual pr=
ocesses and workarounds that would shock you if you knew about them.
There is no magical AI automation system that Amazon just deployed that eli=
minated 30,000 roles overnight. The technology isn=E2=80=99t there yet. The=
 people who remain at Amazon are stressed and overwhelmed trying to pick up=
 the work.
Want to know how I know? Look at where the cuts landed.
MGM took a big hit. The Hollywood studio Amazon acquired a few years ago. I=
f Amazon had really made some breakthrough in AI automation that eliminated=
 tens of thousands of jobs, do you really think they applied it to MGM firs=
t? Of course not. MGM got cut because it=E2=80=99s an area where Amazon can=
 afford to operate leaner for a while without it directly impacting the AWS=
 competitive situation.
The cuts are happening in places where Amazon thinks they can take a risk o=
n getting less done with fewer people, because they desperately need to rea=
llocate that money to GPUs.
The Contradiction Hiding in Plain Sight
And here=E2=80=99s where this gets really frustrating for me.
Everywhere I look, I=E2=80=99m seeing two contradictory narratives at the s=
ame time:
AI is automating jobs at massive scale (look at Amazon!)
AI is a bubble and we=E2=80=99re all being fooled by hype
Pick one. You can=E2=80=99t have both.
If AI is genuinely automating jobs at the scale these headlines claim, then=
 by definition it=E2=80=99s not a bubble. And if we=E2=80=99re actually in =
a bubble, then companies wouldn=E2=80=99t be able to credibly blame layoffs=
 on AI automation. The automation wouldn=E2=80=99t be working well enough t=
o justify the cuts.
So which is it?=20
Well, let=E2=80=99s look at the actual demand signals. Amazon has a 25% sho=
rtfall in GPUs right now. Demand is vastly exceeding supply. They literally=
 cannot get enough chips to serve all their customers who want AI infrastru=
cture. Azure and Google Cloud are in the same position, massively expanding=
 data centers and still can=E2=80=99t keep up.
When you have customers lined up out the door and you physically cannot ser=
ve them all because you don=E2=80=99t have enough hardware, that is not a b=
ubble. That is genuine demand for genuine value.
So no, we=E2=80=99re not in an AI bubble. And no, AI hasn=E2=80=99t automat=
ed away 30,000 Amazon jobs.
What actually happened is that Amazon needed cash to buy GPUs to compete in=
 AI cloud, and they got that cash by cutting costs elsewhere. It=E2=80=99s =
corporate finance, not technological revolution.
But corporations love the automation story because it makes them sound inno=
vative. Wall Street loves it because they understand =E2=80=9Cefficiency ga=
ins.=E2=80=9D And tech journalists love it because it=E2=80=99s dramatic an=
d scary and gets clicks.
So everyone runs with a narrative that doesn=E2=80=99t hold up under five m=
inutes of scrutiny.
How to Think About What=E2=80=99s Coming
Look, none of this analysis makes losing your job any easier. Getting laid =
off is brutal. I=E2=80=99ve been through it.
If you=E2=80=99re one of the 30,000 people who got cut this week, the reaso=
n doesn=E2=80=99t change your immediate situation. You still lost your job =
either way. And to all the Amazon alumni reading this: you=E2=80=99re going=
 to land somewhere good. The community has your back.
But for everyone else trying to understand what=E2=80=99s happening, the re=
ason matters a lot.
Because the story you believe determines how you respond.
If you think AI is already automating jobs at massive scale, the rational r=
esponse is panic. Pull back. Hunker down. Stop investing in learning new th=
ings because what=E2=80=99s the point if it=E2=80=99s all getting automated=
 anyway.
But if you understand that we=E2=80=99re in a period where companies are ma=
king huge infrastructure bets on AI and sometimes funding those bets by cut=
ting costs in other areas, the rational response is completely different.
It=E2=80=99s to recognize that AI is creating real value (the GPU shortage =
proves that) but the technology isn=E2=80=99t mature enough to eliminate mo=
st roles yet. Companies are positioning for a future that=E2=80=99s coming,=
 and that positioning creates short-term chaos as they reallocate resources=
=2E
The smart move isn=E2=80=99t to panic. It=E2=80=99s to understand what=E2=
=80=99s actually valuable about AI, where the technology actually works tod=
ay versus where it=E2=80=99s still falling short, and how to position yours=
elf to benefit from the transition.
The people who understand what=E2=80=99s really happening will make much be=
tter decisions than the people who buy whatever narrative is trending on Tw=
itter.
How to Read Layoff News Without Losing Your Mind
If you want to get better at cutting through the spin when companies announ=
ce layoffs, I built something that might help: Tech Layoff News Decoder [ h=
ttps://substack.com/redirect/42c4552c-dec8-43e0-8099-76a5fa347727?j=3DeyJ1I=
joiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
It walks you through the questions that actually matter: What=E2=80=99s the=
 financial pressure? Where specifically are cuts happening? What=E2=80=99s =
the timeline? What=E2=80=99s the competitive context?
Because the official story (whether it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CAI automation=E2=
=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cefficiency improvements=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cstrategic r=
ealignment=E2=80=9D) is almost never the full truth. You have to look at th=
e money, the competitive dynamics, and the capital allocation to figure out=
 what=E2=80=99s really going on.
In Amazon=E2=80=99s case, following those questions leads you straight to t=
he GPU problem. The cuts are in areas that don=E2=80=99t help AWS compete i=
n AI. The timing aligns with massive infrastructure spending. The automatio=
n narrative doesn=E2=80=99t match the actual state of the technology.
Follow the money, not the PR.
Amazon didn=E2=80=99t fire 30,000 people because robots took their jobs. Th=
ey fired 30,000 people to free up cash to buy the hardware they need to sta=
y competitive in AI cloud.
It=E2=80=99s not a story about AI apocalypse. It=E2=80=99s a story about a =
company that fell behind and is trying to catch up.
Next time you see a headline screaming about AI and layoffs, ask yourself: =
does this narrative actually hold together? Can these claims all be true at=
 once? Or is someone trying to sell you a story that sounds good but falls =
apart when you think about it?
Because we=E2=80=99re getting a lot of stories right now. And most of them =
are wrong.
Good luck out there. Don=E2=80=99t get fooled.

 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

 you think of the everything store, the cardboard boxes showing up on your =
doorstep, the retail empire. But retail margins are terrible. Amazon could =
sell twice as much stuff tomorrow and it wouldn=E2=80=99t move the needle o=
n profitability.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);lin=
e-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The actual money comes from AWS. The cloud=
 computing business is the whole game. Every quarter, Wall Street looks at =
exactly one number: AWS growth rate. That number is everything.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

le=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: =
16px;">AWS growth has been decelerating for years. They=E2=80=99re down to =
18% year-over-year, and while that still sounds impressive, Wall Street hat=
es the trend. Especially because Azure and Google Cloud have been closing t=
he gap fast, powered almost entirely by AI infrastructure.</p><p style=3D"m=

When companies want to build AI products today, they=E2=80=99re thinking ab=
out Azure. They=E2=80=99re thinking about Google Cloud. AWS has fallen to a=
 distant third place in the race that matters most for their future.</p><p =
style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-siz=

 serious about AI. And to do that, they need Nvidia GPUs. Lots of them, and=
 they need them now.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55)=
;line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">These aren=E2=80=99t normal chips. Eac=
h one costs about as much as a decent car. And to compete at scale in AI in=
frastructure, you need thousands upon thousands of them.</p><p style=3D"mar=

 was already doing their jobs. They laid off 30,000 people because they nee=
ded the cash right now to buy GPUs and catch up in the AI cloud race.</p><p=
 style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-si=

0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Now obviously, t=
hat doesn=E2=80=99t sound great from a PR perspective. So instead, Amazon p=
ositions it as forward-thinking efficiency gains through AI automation. And=
 tech journalists, who generally don=E2=80=99t understand enterprise cloud =
economics, run with it.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,=
55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">But anyone who=E2=80=99s actually w=
orked inside Amazon (and I have) knows that=E2=80=99s not reality. The inte=
rnal systems are not some gleaming automated wonderland. They=E2=80=99re he=

shock you if you knew about them.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: =
rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">There is no magical AI au=
tomation system that Amazon just deployed that eliminated 30,000 roles over=
night. The technology isn=E2=80=99t there yet. The people who remain at Ama=
zon are stressed and overwhelmed trying to pick up the work.</p><p style=3D=

GM took a big hit. The Hollywood studio Amazon acquired a few years ago. If=
 Amazon had really made some breakthrough in AI automation that eliminated =
tens of thousands of jobs, do you really think they applied it to MGM first=
? Of course not. MGM got cut because it=E2=80=99s an area where Amazon can =
afford to operate leaner for a while without it directly impacting the AWS =
competitive situation.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,5=
5);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">The cuts are happening in places whe=
re Amazon thinks they can take a risk on getting less done with fewer peopl=
e, because they desperately need to reallocate that money to GPUs.</p><h2 c=

</ol><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;=

 AI is genuinely automating jobs at the scale these headlines claim, then b=
y definition it=E2=80=99s not a bubble. And if we=E2=80=99re actually in a =
bubble, then companies wouldn=E2=80=99t be able to credibly blame layoffs o=
n AI automation. The automation wouldn=E2=80=99t be working well enough to =
justify the cuts.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);li=

 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">Well, le=
t=E2=80=99s look at the actual demand signals. Amazon has a 25% shortfall i=
n GPUs right now. Demand is vastly exceeding supply. They literally cannot =
get enough chips to serve all their customers who want AI infrastructure. A=
zure and Google Cloud are in the same position, massively expanding data ce=
nters and still can=E2=80=99t keep up.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;co=
lor: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">When you have custom=
ers lined up out the door and you physically cannot serve them all because =
you don=E2=80=99t have enough hardware, that is not a bubble. That is genui=
ne demand for genuine value.</p><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(5=
4,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16px;">So no, we=E2=80=99re not in an=
 AI bubble. And no, AI hasn=E2=80=99t automated away 30,000 Amazon jobs.</p=
><p style=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font=
-size: 16px;">What actually happened is that Amazon needed cash to buy GPUs=
 to compete in AI cloud, and they got that cash by cutting costs elsewhere.=
 It=E2=80=99s corporate finance, not technological revolution.</p><p style=
=3D"margin: 0 0 20px 0;color: rgb(54,55,55);line-height: 26px;font-size: 16=

 innovative. Wall Street loves it because they understand =E2=80=9Cefficien=
