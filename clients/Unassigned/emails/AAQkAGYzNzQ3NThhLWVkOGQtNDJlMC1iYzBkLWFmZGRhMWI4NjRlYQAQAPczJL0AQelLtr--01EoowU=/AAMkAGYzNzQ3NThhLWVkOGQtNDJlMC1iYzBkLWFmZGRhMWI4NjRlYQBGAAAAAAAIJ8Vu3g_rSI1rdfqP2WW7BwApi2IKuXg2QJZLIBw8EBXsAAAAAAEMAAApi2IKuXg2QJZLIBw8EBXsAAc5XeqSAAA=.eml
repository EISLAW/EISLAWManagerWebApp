THE COMING COMPETITION IN DEEP-SEA MINING [3]
GETTING IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR WILL ALLOW COUNTRIES TO SET THE TERMS IN THE FUTURE.
BY: ALLISON FEDIRKA
It’s not every day that small, remote islands emerge as geopolitical inflection points. And yet places like American Samoa, Cook Islands and others are doing just that as they set precedent and lead
development in deep-sea mining. They can’t do it alone, of course. Just last week, the U.S. Department of the Interior took the first step toward lease sales that will allow for offshore mining in
non-continental U.S. territory. The move reflects the broader U.S. strategy to maximize the value of its vast offshore territory – that is, exclusive economic zones – and position itself as a
leader in the nascent deep-sea mining industry. Doing so now will help Washington position itself as a leader in this space.
In theory, the U.S. could jump-start this industry in any number of places in the ocean. But Washington has economic and legal reasons for focusing its efforts on EEZs in the Pacific. The United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) established that a nation has the sovereign right to explore, exploit and develop natural resources located in the seabed, subsoil and waters off the
coasts of its territory. The U.S. boasts the largest EEZ in the world – its offshore holdings are bigger than its territorial holdings – so Washington is ideally suited to exploit their potential,
especially in places like American Samoa that already have proven mineral deposits. Thus in 2018, the U.S. launched a new ocean policy aimed at advancing its economic, security and environmental
interests. The initiative prioritized economic prosperity, food security, maritime security and developing the technology needed for such efforts. The Trump administration’s recent executive orders
prioritizing deep-sea mining efforts build on this policy.

More, the legal status awarded to EEZs by the UNCLOS allows the U.S. to operate uncontested in clearly demarcated areas. Though the U.S. never signed the UNCLOS, it has sent observers to negotiations
at the International Seabed Authority, refrained from objecting to international regulation of the high seas, and generally avoided violating the convention. For now, it suits the U.S. to keep EEZ
rules in place because they give Washington free rein to explore and develop seabed mining within its territories. This approach is critical for private sector participation, which plays a major role
in the overall U.S. strategy. Under the UNCLOS, none of the 168 states that ratified the agreement can recognize the legitimacy of an unlicensed deep-sea mining claim. That means mining operations
need to be U.N.-compliant to facilitate the sale of their offtake. By beginning in EEZs, the U.S. reduces the risks associated with seabed exploration and exploitation in areas beyond national
jurisdiction. It also expedites the process of issuing licenses because this type of arrangement deals with the U.S. government alone, as opposed to an international body like the ISA whose members
may have different interests in a project.

The location of American Samoa in the Penrhyn Basin also works to the U.S. advantage. The basin is home to a large density of high-grade polymetallic nodules, making it the world’s second most
valuable source of such nodules behind the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Nodules in the Penrhyn Basin contain valuable materials – cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, titanium, tellurium, niobium,
yttrium, platinum and zirconium – that are vital in the manufacturing of batteries, electronics and defense equipment. Unlike other parts of the ocean, this area has virtually zero surface
nutrients; the basin cannot support sea life, and boasts very low biomass and low species richness. This means there are fewer environmental hurdles to jump there than in other seabed mining zones.

The advantages offered by EEZs and the Penrhyn Basin are available in other islands in the region. Cook Islands is exemplary in this regard, thanks to the amount of deposits located within its EEZ and
to the government’s efforts to develop them. The country has been conducting subsea survey cruises and gathering data for more than 50 years. It has also established a clear regulatory environment
that allows it to work with international partners who remain essential for moving these costly projects forward. The projects include plans to start trial harvesting permits along with exploration
licenses. They play a role in developing the technology to transport nodules from the seabed to the ocean surface, with a premium placed on cost efficiency, energy efficiency and low environmental
impact. Given its small size and limited resources, Cook Islands needs and has already worked with a variety of foreign partners including Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, the U.S. and China.
The promise of tapping into new natural resources that could aid economic development and diversification appeals to several island nations in the Penrhyn Basin. Tonga and Kiribati, too, have domestic
laws in place to regulate seabed mining in their territories. (Nauru and Papua New Guinea have expressed interest in developing seabed mining as well.) And because they rely on foreign partners to
spearhead these efforts, these projects raise the possibility of competition and conflict, particularly among islands that are not foreign-held territories. For example, the U.S. established
diplomatic relations with Cook Islands and Niue in 2023, both of whose EEZs border American Samoa’s. Washington explicitly stated that the strategic focus for bilateral relations was to counter
Chinese influence and cooperation in the area of seabed mining. Even so, in February 2025, Cook Islands signed a five-year agreement with China on deep-sea mining within its EEZ. Beijing is also
reportedly courting Kiribati for similar cooperation efforts. (Though the focus appears to be on the rights the island nation holds over deposits in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, interest in the EEZ
cannot be ruled out.) For its part, Tonga has issued seabed mining licenses to Canadian, Australian and Korean entities to operate within its EEZ. This practice of working with foreign partners sets
the precedent for other extra-regional actors to enter the competition for the South Pacific’s resources.

The biggest impediment to all-out competition for these islands’ mining rights is environmental concerns. Australia remains open to seabed mining with commercial applications, provided environmental
protections are first in place. Micronesia, Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium on seabed mining until a framework for its responsible development is in place. France
and New Zealand have called for a ban on deep-sea mining altogether – although France is perhaps still on the fence. Paris allocated 25 million euros ($28 million) to fund a deep-sea research
project to better understand the ocean seabed, and it allocated another 29 million euros to develop new tech and industry related to deep-sea activity. It is also exploring ways to loosen laws that
regulate EU environmental policy.
Deep-sea mining could have longer-term, indirect geopolitical implications. For example, tech development in countries like France, the U.S., South Korea, China, Belgium, Germany and Canada that would
be used in mining – surveillance, extraction and mineral processing – could spur advancements in things like artificial intelligence, data processing, machine learning, autonomous underwater
vehicles, robotic systems and sensors. The evolution of practices and precedents in Penrhyn Basin EEZs could also lead to activity in other EEZs with overlapping seabed deposits. The evolution in
deep-sea mining, moreover, comes as international alliances and institutions are being restructured or questioned altogether.
One way or another, the growing demand, potential commercial gains and resource competition endemic to deep-sea mining will have consequences. There is an implicit understanding that taking the lead
and occupying the space in these early stages will give stakeholders an upper hand in setting the terms of this nascent industry.

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It=E2=80=99s not e=
very day that small, remote islands emerge as geopolitical inflection point=
s. And yet places like American Samoa, Cook Islands and others are doing ju=
st that as they set precedent and lead development in deep-sea mining. They=
 can=E2=80=99t do it alone, of course. Just last week, the U.S. Department =
of the Interior took the first step toward lease sales that will allow for =
offshore mining in non-continental U.S. territory. The move reflects the br=
oader U.S. strategy to maximize the value of its vast offshore territory =
=E2=80=93 that is, exclusive economic zones =E2=80=93 and position itself a=
s a leader in the nascent deep-sea mining industry. Doing so now will help =
Washington position itself as a leader in this space.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">In theory, the U.S=
. could jump-start this industry in any number of places in the ocean. But =
Washington has economic and legal reasons for focusing its efforts on EEZs =
in the Pacific. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS=
) established that a nation has the sovereign right to explore, exploit and=
 develop natural resources located in the seabed, subsoil and waters off th=
e coasts of its territory. The U.S. boasts the largest EEZ in the world =E2=
=80=93 its offshore holdings are bigger than its territorial holdings =E2=
=80=93 so Washington is ideally suited to exploit their potential, especial=
ly in places like American Samoa that already have proven mineral deposits.=
 Thus in 2018, the U.S. launched a new ocean policy aimed at advancing its =
economic, security and environmental interests. The initiative prioritized =
economic prosperity, food security, maritime security and developing the te=
chnology needed for such efforts. The Trump administration=E2=80=99s recent=
 executive orders prioritizing deep-sea mining efforts build on this policy=
.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">More, the legal st=
atus awarded to EEZs by the UNCLOS allows the U.S. to operate uncontested i=
n clearly demarcated areas. Though the U.S. never signed the UNCLOS, it has=
 sent observers to negotiations at the International Seabed Authority, refr=
ained from objecting to international regulation of the high seas, and gene=
rally avoided violating the convention. For now, it suits the U.S. to keep =
EEZ rules in place because they give Washington free rein to explore and de=
velop seabed mining within its territories. This approach is critical for p=
rivate sector participation, which plays a major role in the overall U.S. s=
trategy. Under the UNCLOS, none of the 168 states that ratified the agreeme=
nt can recognize the legitimacy of an unlicensed deep-sea mining claim. Tha=
t means mining operations need to be U.N.-compliant to facilitate the sale =
of their offtake. By beginning in EEZs, the U.S. reduces the risks associat=
ed with seabed exploration and exploitation in areas beyond national jurisd=
iction. It also expedites the process of issuing licenses because this type=
 of arrangement deals with the U.S. government alone, as opposed to an inte=
rnational body like the ISA whose members may have different interests in a=
 project.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The location of Am=
erican Samoa in the Penrhyn Basin also works to the U.S. advantage. The bas=
in is home to a large density of high-grade polymetallic nodules, making it=
 the world=E2=80=99s second most valuable source of such nodules behind the=
 Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Nodules in the Penrhyn Basin contain valuable mat=
erials =E2=80=93 cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, titanium, tellurium, ni=
obium, yttrium, platinum and zirconium =E2=80=93 that are vital in the manu=
facturing of batteries, electronics and defense equipment. Unlike other par=
ts of the ocean, this area has virtually zero surface nutrients; the basin =
cannot support sea life, and boasts very low biomass and low species richne=
ss. This means there are fewer environmental hurdles to jump there than in =
other seabed mining zones.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The advantages off=
ered by EEZs and the Penrhyn Basin are available in other islands in the re=
gion. Cook Islands is exemplary in this regard, thanks to the amount of dep=
osits located within its EEZ and to the government=E2=80=99s efforts to dev=
elop them. The country has been conducting subsea survey cruises and gather=
ing data for more than 50 years. It has also established a clear regulatory=
 environment that allows it to work with international partners who remain =
essential for moving these costly projects forward. The projects include pl=
ans to start trial harvesting permits along with exploration licenses. They=
 play a role in developing the technology to transport nodules from the sea=
bed to the ocean surface, with a premium placed on cost efficiency, energy =
efficiency and low environmental impact. Given its small size and limited r=
esources, Cook Islands needs and has already worked with a variety of forei=
gn partners including Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, the U.S. and China.<=
/p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The promise of tap=
ping into new natural resources that could aid economic development and div=
ersification appeals to several island nations in the Penrhyn Basin. Tonga =
and Kiribati, too, have domestic laws in place to regulate seabed mining in=
 their territories. (Nauru and Papua New Guinea have expressed interest in =
developing seabed mining as well.) And because they rely on foreign partner=
s to spearhead these efforts, these projects raise the possibility of compe=
tition and conflict, particularly among islands that are not foreign-held t=
erritories. For example, the U.S. established diplomatic relations with Coo=
k Islands and Niue in 2023, both of whose EEZs border American Samoa=E2=80=
=99s. Washington explicitly stated that the strategic focus for bilateral r=
elations was to counter Chinese influence and cooperation in the area of se=
abed mining. Even so, in February 2025, Cook Islands signed a five-year agr=
eement with China on deep-sea mining within its EEZ. Beijing is also report=
edly courting Kiribati for similar cooperation efforts. (Though the focus a=
ppears to be on the rights the island nation holds over deposits in the Cla=
rion-Clipperton Zone, interest in the EEZ cannot be ruled out.) For its par=
t, Tonga has issued seabed mining licenses to Canadian, Australian and Kore=
an entities to operate within its EEZ. This practice of working with foreig=
n partners sets the precedent for other extra-regional actors to enter the =
competition for the South Pacific=E2=80=99s resources.</p>

<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The biggest impedi=
ment to all-out competition for these islands=E2=80=99 mining rights is env=
ironmental concerns. Australia remains open to seabed mining with commercia=
l applications, provided environmental protections are first in place. Micr=
onesia, Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium=
 on seabed mining until a framework for its responsible development is in p=
lace. France and New Zealand have called for a ban on deep-sea mining altog=
ether =E2=80=93 although France is perhaps still on the fence. Paris alloca=
ted 25 million euros ($28 million) to fund a deep-sea research project to b=
etter understand the ocean seabed, and it allocated another 29 million euro=
s to develop new tech and industry related to deep-sea activity. It is also=
 exploring ways to loosen laws that regulate EU environmental policy.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Deep-sea mining co=
uld have longer-term, indirect geopolitical implications. For example, tech=
 development in countries like France, the U.S., South Korea, China, Belgiu=
m, Germany and Canada that would be used in mining =E2=80=93 surveillance, =
extraction and mineral processing =E2=80=93 could spur advancements in thin=
gs like artificial intelligence, data processing, machine learning, autonom=
ous underwater vehicles, robotic systems and sensors. The evolution of prac=
tices and precedents in Penrhyn Basin EEZs could also lead to activity in o=
ther EEZs with overlapping seabed deposits. The evolution in deep-sea minin=
g, moreover, comes as international alliances and institutions are being re=
structured or questioned altogether.</p>
<p style=3D"line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">One way or another=
, the growing demand, potential commercial gains and resource competition e=
ndemic to deep-sea mining will have consequences. There is an implicit unde=
rstanding that taking the lead and occupying the space in these early stage=
s will give stakeholders an upper hand in setting the terms of this nascent=
 industry.</p>
