here are six things we=E2=80=99re very very good at that have tremendous ec=
onomic value that LLMs are just not getting better at.
Subscribers get all these pieces!
The Irreducible Human: Six Things We Still Do That Machines Can't
Field notes from the bleeding edge of human-machine collaboration
Here's the thing nobody tells you about working with frontier models: the v=
ertigo isn't from their intelligence per se. It's from watching the sheer p=
ace of gains in intelligence in very narrow lanes. It is an alien intellige=
nce.
This is the reality of spiky intelligence=E2=80=94brilliant in one dimensio=
n, inconsistent in another. Opus 4 can sustain focus for hours, producing c=
ode that actually runs in a remarkable percentage of cases and even fixing =
very hard bugs [ https://substack.com/redirect/13220dc4-179f-460b-a7df-48ba=
2bafd103?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw=
0 ]. But the gains are spiky. They don=E2=80=99t always work. We live in a =
universe where people can complain and praise Opus 4 at the same time. And =
that typically means inconsistency!
What=E2=80=99s going on here? First, this isn=E2=80=99t an Opus 4 issue! It=
=E2=80=99s an LLM issue. Frankly, we humans are also not all that consisten=
t [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a286a58-ac94-4838-b6d4-ce3ae5a234ba?j=3D=
eyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ].
We're not in a 1:1 capability race anymore. There are things LLMs are bette=
r at than us, and (critically) vice versa. So I think it=E2=80=99s more int=
eresting to say we=E2=80=99re mapping the topology of intelligence itself=
=E2=80=94finding the peaks and valleys, the smooth gradients and the sheer =
cliffs. And the most interesting terrain? The places where human cognition =
does something so weird, so inefficient, so magnificently context-dependent=
 that it works.
1. The Metaphor Engine (Or: Why Your Brain is a Kleptomaniac)
As an example: Thursday, 3 AM, debugging a distributed consensus problem [ =
https://substack.com/redirect/00b2e09f-57f8-4c15-9413-528dc543c9bc?j=3DeyJ1=
IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]. The traditio=
nal approaches are failing. The academic papers are useless. The LLM is gen=
erating variations on themes that don't work. Then your sleep-deprived brai=
n notices your daughter's friendship bracelet on my desk=E2=80=94those litt=
le beads that slide until you pull the strings tight=E2=80=94and suddenly y=
ou=E2=80=99re sketching a tension-based consensus mechanism that shouldn't =
work but does. (By the way, consensus problems have interesting application=
s in multi-LLM agent problems.)
This is the human superpower: grand theft cognition. We don't search our ex=
perience; we raid it. That sensor problem on tomorrow's Mars rover? Watch a=
 human engineer steal from origami, from their coffee percolation, from the=
 way their cat stretches after a nap. It's not analogical reasoning in any =
clean sense=E2=80=94it's conceptual piracy at scale. JRR Tolkien famously s=
cribbled a nonsense phrase on the back of his exam papers that became the s=
eed for one of the best-selling children=E2=80=99s books of all time: in a =
hole in the ground their lived a hobbit. That=E2=80=99s how human cognition=
 works=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s not how LLMs work.
LLMs interpolate brilliantly within their training manifold. They can blend=
 concepts, vary parameters, explore the space between known points with sup=
erhuman finesse. But they can't reach into the void and grab something that=
 has no business being there. They can't take a principle from mycorrhizal =
networks and slam it into a caching problem just because the shapes feel si=
milar in some ineffable way.
The difference is visceral when you're in the thick of it. The model gives =
you correct solutions. The human gives you wrong solutions that turn out to=
 be right for reasons nobody could have predicted.
2. The Courage to Create (Or: Backing the Wrong Horse Until It Wins)
There's a moment in most creative processes=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve seen it ov=
er and over again=E2=80=94where you have to choose the stupid option. Not t=
he risky option. Not the innovative option. The stupid one. The melody that=
 refuses to resolve. The architecture that breaks every best practice. The =
hypothesis that makes senior engineers do that thing with their eyebrows.=
=20
Amazon does this so much it=E2=80=99s an interview question. What would you=
 change about the Amazon homepage? The correct answer is everything is test=
ed to hell and back. And so even if a designer says it looks terrible (whic=
h it does). And it violates design principles=E2=80=94it doesn=E2=80=99t ma=
tter. It works.=20
As an example of stupid=E2=80=94where are the buttons on this page?
(Yes, I=E2=80=99m shopping for shelving.)
Look, this is especially true with design. LLM-generated designs are cleane=
r, more consistent, often have higher usability scores in testing. But they=
 also cluster around the mid. They are not particularly creative.
LLMs don=E2=80=99t understand that wrongness can have a point, can be the p=
oint. It forces attention in exactly the right places.
Models can generate a thousand variations, each more polished than the last=
=2E They can even inject randomness, co=
ntrolled chaos, calculated rule-breaki=
ng. What they can't do is fall in love with the wrong solution and nurse it=
 through the valley of death on pure conviction.
Creativity isn't just generating options=E2=80=94any decent model can do th=
at now. It's having the taste to recognize the ugly duckling and the spine =
to defend it until everyone else sees the swan.
3. The Weight of Consequences (Or: Why Humans Double-Check and Machines Don=
't)
An LLM has never sat in a blameless post-mortem that everyone knows is actu=
ally blameful. Never felt the specific texture of dread when Datadog starts=
 lighting up at 11 PM on a Friday. Never had to explain to a room full of p=
eople why your "elegant refactor" just cost the company six figures in down=
time.
This shapes everything. When I review work now, I'm not just checking corre=
ctness=E2=80=94I'm pattern-matching against every post-mortem I've ever att=
ended, every hard conversation about a failed launch I=E2=80=99ve been a pa=
rt of. That clever optimization? I've seen its cousin take down production.=
 That innocent-looking customer request? It was tried four jobs ago and boy=
 did that not go well.
The model sees code. I see scars.
This isn't about risk aversion=E2=80=94sometimes the scars tell you when to=
 be more aggressive, not less. It's about the invisible physics of accounta=
bility. Every decision carries the weight of future explaining, future emai=
ls, future "quick sync" meetings that are never quick. That weight shapes t=
he solution space in ways no training data captures.
Watch a senior engineer review a PR sometime. Half their feedback isn't abo=
ut the code at all=E2=80=94it's about the humans who will maintain it, the =
on-call rotation that will debug it, the junior dev who will misunderstand =
it six months from now. They're optimizing for a loss function that include=
s their own future 3 AM self.
4. The View from 30,000 Feet (Or: Why Context is a Superpower)
Models excel at local optimization=E2=80=94give them a function, they'll fi=
nd the gradient with brutal efficiency. But they can't hold the whole churn=
ing mess in view. The CEO's recent obsession with that competitor's blog po=
st. The unspoken tension between frontend and backend after the last reorg.=
 The way everyone's pretending the Q4 deadline is realistic when we all kno=
w it isn't.
Humans carry these massive, incoherent contexts in our heads. Not accuratel=
y=E2=80=94I once spent a month optimizing for a priority that had been depr=
ioritized in a meeting I'd missed. But usefully. We feel the temperature of=
 the room, sense the political undercurrents, know which technical debt wil=
l actually get paid down and which will metastasize.
There's a specific kind of knowledge that lives in the gaps between documen=
ted decisions. Why we never touch that particular service even though it's =
a mess. Which team actually owns that repo despite what the CODEOWNERS file=
 says. The real reason we use that weird library (hint: it's not technical)=
=2E Or the real reason we=E2=80=99re havin=
g so much trouble getting to WCAG c=
ompliance (hint, it=E2=80=99s usually not technical either).
This isn't intelligence in any clean sense. It's the accumulated scar tissu=
e of living in the system, not just analyzing it. It's knowing that the ele=
gant solution to today's problem creates next quarter's migration nightmare=
, feeling when the data is right but the timing is wrong, sensing when a te=
chnical victory would be a political disaster.
5. Stories All the Way Down (Or: The Compression Algorithm of Meaning)
Hand a board of directors a perfectly accurate 100-page analysis and watch =
their eyes glaze over by slide three. Tell them a two-minute story about a =
customer who almost churned but didn't, and watch them lean forward. This i=
sn't a bug in human attention=E2=80=94it's our deepest technology.
Pattern recognition is table stakes now. Any frontier model can surface ins=
ights that would take human analysts months to find. And that=E2=80=99s ama=
zing! But patterns aren't persuasive. Stories are. The ability to take a co=
nstellation of facts and thread them into a narrative that carries not just=
 information but significance=E2=80=94that's how we turn analysis into acti=
on.
Stories aren't just good pedagogy. They're compression algorithms for meani=
ng. They take the state space of all possible interpretations and collapse =
it to a single narrative trajectory. Beginning, middle, end. Tension, resol=
ution. Character, change.
We're not just pattern-matching machines. We're meaning-making machines. An=
d meaning travels at the speed of story. And stories have tremendous utilit=
y in business (just ask Steve Jobs [ https://substack.com/redirect/0df70feb=
-a4e2-4b45-b4f0-e0ee961d32fb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC=
7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]).
6. The Uncomfortable Choice (Or: Calculating Regret in Base Human)
Here's where it gets interesting. Revenue projections say launch. Technical=
 debt says refactor. Team morale says slow down. Market window says speed u=
p. The model says A/B test. Your gut says something's wrong but can't artic=
ulate what.
This isn't a problem to be solved. It's the human condition.
Models can enumerate options, calculate probabilities, simulate outcomes wi=
th error bars. But they can't choose which regret you're willing to carry. =
They can't weigh your personal risk tolerance against your team's burnout a=
gainst your startup's runway against your own imposter syndrome at 4 AM.
I've made too many of these calls. The worst ones were sometimes the most "=
correct" by any objective measure. The best ones often looked insane on pap=
er but felt right in some ineffable way. Not because intuition is magic=E2=
=80=94because it's running calculations in a base we don't have notation fo=
r.
These aren't decisions in the clean, algorithmic sense. They're judgments=
=E2=80=94messy, value-laden, context-drenched judgments that only make sens=
e if you're the one who has to live with them. The model can tell you the o=
dds. Only you can decide which dice to roll.
The Partnership Proposition
So where does this leave us? The bleeding edge right now is learning to wor=
k with spiky intelligence [ https://substack.com/redirect/8047f60c-2888-4f1=
a-9da8-6c2a2fe4d572?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6Rx=
Q4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94models that are breathtakingly capable in one dimens=
ion while blind in another. Claude 4 Opus can sustain coding focus for hour=
s, producing volume and complexity that would burn out a human team. But so=
meone still needs to ask: will this actually deploy? Will the tests catch t=
he edge cases? Does this solve the real problem or just the one we articula=
ted?
The future isn't about protecting human jobs from AI encroachment=E2=80=94t=
hat ship has sailed, caught fire, and sunk. It's about recognizing that int=
elligence was never one thing. It's a symphony of capabilities, and we're j=
ust starting to learn which instruments play which parts.
The models are getting scary good at the measurable stuff: pattern recognit=
ion, optimization, generation, transformation. They'll own these territorie=
s completely within two years. Meanwhile, humans are retreating upmarket in=
to the ineffable: the leap, the story, the judgment call, the accountabilit=
y, the meaning.
The most powerful systems won't be pure AI or pure human, but the weird cyb=
ernetic centaurs that emerge when both parties play to their strengths. Whe=
n models do what they do best=E2=80=94process, pattern-match, and propose=
=E2=80=94while humans do what we do best=E2=80=94connect, create, and choos=
e.
That vertigo I mentioned at the start? It's not about being replaced. It's =
about discovering that we've been playing the wrong game. We thought intell=
igence was about getting the right answer. Turns out it's about asking the =
right question. And sometimes, more importantly, knowing when the right ans=
wer is actually wrong.
I'm collecting edge cases where human judgment beats model intelligence. Se=
nd me your weirdest examples=E2=80=94especially the ones that make no sense=
 until they do.
