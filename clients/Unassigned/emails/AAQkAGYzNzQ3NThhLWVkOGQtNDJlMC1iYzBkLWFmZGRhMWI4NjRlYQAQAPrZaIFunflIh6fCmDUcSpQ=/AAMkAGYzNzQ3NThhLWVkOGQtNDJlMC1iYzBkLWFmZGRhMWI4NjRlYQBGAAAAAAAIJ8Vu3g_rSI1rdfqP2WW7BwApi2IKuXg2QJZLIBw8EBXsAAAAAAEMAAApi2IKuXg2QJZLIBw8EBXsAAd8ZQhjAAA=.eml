DAILY MEMO: DEVELOPMENTS IN ISRAEL [3]
THE ISRAELI OPERATION TO TAKE OVER GAZA CITY IS PROGRESSING.
BY: GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES
GAZA UPDATE. The Israel Defense Forces currently control 40 percent of Gaza City, an IDF spokesperson said [4] at a press conference on Israel’s operation to take over the city. The Israeli military
has begun mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists this week in preparation for the next phases of the campaign, he added. Meanwhile, senior Israeli security officials and ministers are reportedly
pushing [5] the prime minister privately to reconsider expanding the Gaza ground operation and focus on ceasefire talks instead. Relatedly, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks on Thursday in
Paris with Qatari officials on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli media reported [6].
WEST BANK UPDATE. Senior Israeli security officials have warned the country's leadership about signs of the Palestinian Authority’s internal disintegration, Israel’s Channel 12 reported [7].
According to the assessment, economic conditions in the West Bank are deteriorating and unemployment is rising. Security forces are receiving meager or no salaries. The officials warned that this
situation could lead to an outbreak of violence and that measures would have to be taken if the Israeli government wants to ensure the PA's continued existence.
PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will travel to Moscow [8] in October for the first-ever Russian-Arab summit. Representatives of other Arab countries are also expected
to take part in the meeting.
IRAN AND HAMAS. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks [9] with Hamas leaders Khalil al-Hayya and Abu Marzouk in Doha. Araghchi is in Qatar for meetings with diplomatic officials,
including Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas [10].
DISINTEGRATION. Syrian Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri has called for [11] the creation of an “independent entity” in the southern Syrian province of Sweida. He said Druze forces in
the region were ready to manage security there and asserted the Druze minority’s right to self-determination under international law. He also expressed gratitude to the U.S., Israel, European
coalition states, Kurdish allies and the Alawite community for their support.
ON UKRAINE. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned [12] that foreign troops in Ukraine would be targets for the Russian army if they were deployed during ongoing hostilities. Speaking at the plenary
session of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he dismissed the idea of deploying foreign forces to Ukraine after a peace deal is reached. He also said he sees little point in holding talks
with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to him, a resolution to the conflict would require an end to martial law in Ukraine and new elections.
ON GAZPROM. Also at the forum, Russian energy giant Gazprom signed [13] with Mongolian officials a memorandum of cooperation to study the possibility of exporting natural gas to Ulaanbaatar. Gazprom
also agreed to [14] increase gas supplies to Kazakhstan in 2025 and 2026. The company also announced [15] that it plans to develop the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye oil and gas field in Russia by 2030.
BERLIN'S PART. Germany reportedly plans [16] to contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine by supporting the country’s air defenses. Under the proposal, Berlin would also help boost Ukraine’s
air capabilities with Ukrainian-made cruise missiles and supply equipment for four mechanized infantry brigades. These commitments, however, are conditional on U.S. participation in providing
guarantees, Russia’s involvement in negotiations, and consensus within the German coalition government.
BIG FIND. Rare earth reserves in Kazakhstan’s Karaganda region are estimated to total 28.2 million tons, the region’s deputy leader said [17] following completion of a geological study. He added
that “promising” deposits of gold, copper and tungsten have been identified. This comes after it was recently reported that the U.S. is exploring investment opportunities in Kazakhstan’s rare
earth industry.
INDIA AND SINGAPORE. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong agreed [18] on a roadmap to boost bilateral relations during a meeting in New Delhi. The plan
includes eight main areas of cooperation: economic, skills development, digitalization, sustainability, connectivity, health care and medicine, people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and defense and
security.
MEETING IN UZBEKISTAN. A delegation of military officials from Azerbaijan held talks [19] in Tashkent with their Uzbek counterparts. They discussed a draft plan for bilateral military and
military-technical cooperation in 2026.
PARTNERS. Japan and Australia agreed [20] to expand security cooperation following talks between their defense and foreign ministers. They welcomed Australia’s recent decision to acquire
Japanese-made Mogami-class frigates to replace its own aging fleet of warships.
