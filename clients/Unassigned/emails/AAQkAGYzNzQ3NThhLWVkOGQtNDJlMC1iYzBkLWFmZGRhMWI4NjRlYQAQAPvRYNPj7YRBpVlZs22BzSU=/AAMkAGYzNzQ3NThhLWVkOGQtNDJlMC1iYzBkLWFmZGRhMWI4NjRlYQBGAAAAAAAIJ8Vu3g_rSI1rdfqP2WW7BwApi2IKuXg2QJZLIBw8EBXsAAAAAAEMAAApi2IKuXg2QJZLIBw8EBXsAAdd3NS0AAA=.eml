Negotiation isn=E2=80=99t just about who has the sharper pitch or louder vo=
ice=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a complex dance involving psychology, timing, and =
subtle power dynamics. It=E2=80=99s hard to learn. And harder when it=E2=80=
=99s impossible to practice.
It would be great if you could practice negotiations before the real thing!=
 But who has six friends and a spare room for that practice product present=
ation? How can you be sure you got the roles right? How can you play multip=
le timelines to see what=E2=80=99s better?
Whether that=E2=80=99s a job interview that matters, compensation negotiati=
on, or a huge product presentation=E2=80=94we are used to living in a world=
 where only get one shot at what really matters.=20
Not anymore.
Recently, I wrote a 141 page guide about digital twins [ https://substack.c=
om/redirect/e68c2abd-ceac-4d1b-8b2f-3816af817ca8?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zd=
zy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ]=E2=80=94sophisticated, data-dri=
ven simulations that model high-stakes business scenarios.=20
You guys loved the power but I kept getting asked for something simpler:=20
Nate, make it no-code!
Nate, it needs to run in my ChatGPT.
Nate, come on it cannot be that hard.
Well, it=E2=80=99s not. It=E2=80=99s totally doable inside ChatGPT with zer=
o code in a couple of minutes.
Challenge accepted.
Today, I=E2=80=99m revealing exactly how I rehearsed a high-stakes $200K sa=
lary negotiation battle using a single, carefully constructed AI prompt.=20
This method isn=E2=80=99t theoretical AI fluff=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s practic=
al, copy-and-paste realism designed to pressure-test any negotiation scenar=
io. With just a few lines, you=E2=80=99ll effortlessly simulate everything =
from intense salary discussions and critical job interviews to pivotal boar=
d meetings and challenging VC pitches.=20
This is another one of those super-prompts, but this one is specifically de=
signed to help you model tough negotiation simulations with digital twins.
Each participant=E2=80=94whether it=E2=80=99s a skeptical CFO, an overwhelm=
ed CTO, or a buzzword-happy CEO=E2=80=94comes alive with distinct motivatio=
ns, voice, and (where applicable) stubborn resistance. They=E2=80=99ll play=
 their roles consistently over and over while you practice until you get th=
e right line=E2=80=94and the prompt makes sure ChatGPT gives you feedback w=
hen you=E2=80=99re done!
Why does this matter? Because negotiations are the highest leverage moments=
 in our careers, and we just haven=E2=80=99t had great options to practice =
them before.
I=E2=80=99ve looked, and most of the AI tools out there are very limited in=
 scope. There isn=E2=80=99t a single prompt I could find that is able to be=
nd itself to your custom situation and give you the simulated world you nee=
d=E2=80=94and then adjust next time to an entirely different negotiation sc=
enario.
This one can. Negotiations shape your career, secure your startup=E2=80=99s=
 funding, and close critical business deals. Realistic practice can make or=
 break outcomes.=20
And as cool as that prompt is, that=E2=80=99s not the only thing I learned =
as I built and tested what I=E2=80=99m sharing today. During testing, I fou=
nd something very interesting: simpler AI models provided measurably and ob=
viously less realistic practice because they pushed back less hard. For ins=
tance, GPT-4o easily conceded a $6,000 salary increase with little resistan=
ce, whereas the o3 fought back intensely=E2=80=94precisely the kind of chal=
lenge you need before negotiating in the real world. All those models? Now =
they=E2=80=99re just levels in your negotiation practice.
By the end of this guide, you=E2=80=99ll clearly understand why this happen=
s and how to leverage it. I=E2=80=99ll provide the exact prompt, break down=
 its strategic design, and demonstrate how to adapt it instantly for your s=
cenarios. No fluff, no coding=E2=80=94just clear insights and actionable st=
eps. Because winning a negotiation isn=E2=80=99t about improvising on the s=
pot; it=E2=80=99s about walking in confidently, already having rehearsed an=
d refined every move.=20
So whether your next big conversation is a presentation or a board meeting =
or a VC pitch or a job interview=E2=80=94you can simulate it with this prom=
pt. And after you read this guide, you=E2=80=99ll be able to build your own=
 too!

How One Prompt Turns ChatGPT Into an Entire Negotiating Team
First here is the prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/f83f07be-787f-4daa=
-a153-55c2b769f1eb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ=
4tAjMRMPOw0 ]
I also prepared some prompt structure notes and 10 prompt building takeaway=
s as a bonus. You=E2=80=99ll find them at the bottom of the page on that li=
nk.
Executive Summary
Negotiation isn=E2=80=99t just about who speaks loudest or argues most conv=
incingly=E2=80=94it involves managing subtle psychological dynamics, precis=
e timing, and nuanced interpersonal relationships. Historically, practicing=
 these skills has been tough due to logistical complexity. In this guide, I=
=E2=80=99m introducing a practical, no-code method that leverages a structu=
red AI prompt within ChatGPT, allowing realistic rehearsal of any high-stak=
es negotiation scenario.
Traditional AI prompts often break down under complexity, quickly losing co=
herence and realism after a few exchanges. To prevent this, I=E2=80=99ve st=
ructured this approach using a clear state-machine architecture, explicitly=
 separating scenario setup from active simulation. First, I sequentially ga=
ther scenario details, confirm each input, then seamlessly transition into =
a live simulation. Critical design elements include detailed personality cu=
es and an explicit concession ledger, ensuring stakeholders maintain consis=
tent motivations and behaviors throughout the negotiation.
During testing, I observed significant differences between AI models. Advan=
ced models like o3 provided more realistic, challenging pushback, while sim=
pler models like 4o proved overly agreeable and unrealistic. For meaningful=
 practice, you need genuine resistance, and that=E2=80=99s exactly what the=
 more sophisticated models deliver.
This approach applies widely=E2=80=94from salary negotiations and critical =
product pitches to intense board presentations and VC investment rounds. By=
 running targeted, authentic simulations, I=E2=80=99ve gotten practically s=
marter at negotiations running this prompt. I think I have deeper confidenc=
e and clearer strategic insights, and I can refine my techniques before ent=
ering real-world negotiations.=20
In this guide, you=E2=80=99ll get immediate access to the exact prompt stru=
cture (above), a detailed breakdown of its technical design, and actionable=
 guidance for quickly adapting it to any negotiation context. There=E2=80=
=99s no coding involved=E2=80=94just pragmatic, realistic practice that mir=
rors the true pressures of high-stakes discussions.
Core Concepts
The Multi-Character Challenge
Most people try to make ChatGPT play multiple characters by just asking nic=
ely. "Now be the CEO. Now be the CFO." This works for about three exchanges=
 before everything falls apart.
Here's what a typical naive attempt looks like:
=E2=9D=8C Bad:
"Play the role of a CEO, CFO, and CTO discussing my product proposal. Make =
it realistic."
By round three, you get responses like:
"CEO: I love this idea!" "CFO: Me too, the numbers look great!" "CTO: No te=
chnical concerns here!"
That's not a simulation. That's a fantasy.
The problem isn't imagination=E2=80=94it's architecture. When you ask an LL=
M to juggle multiple personas in an unstructured conversation, you get:
Character bleed: The CFO starts sounding like the CTO
Motivation drift: The skeptical stakeholder becomes supportive without reas=
on
Context confusion: The model forgets who knows what
Personality collapse: Everyone sounds like the same helpful AI assistant
I've watched lots of these attempts driven off simpler prompts and dumber m=
odels. They start strong=E2=80=94distinct voices, clear conflicts. By round=
 three, it's personality soup. By round five, everyone's agreeing with each=
 other. Not exactly useful practice for that board presentation.
The core issue? We're asking the model to maintain multiple concurrent stat=
es without giving it the scaffolding to do so. It's like asking someone to =
juggle while blindfolded=E2=80=94theoretically possible, but unnecessarily =
difficult.
The State Machine Solution
Here's what actually works: treat the entire negotiation as a deterministic=
 state machine. That sounds complex, but it's not. It means creating a fixe=
d path from setup to execution with clear transitions between states.
The Digital Twin Negotiation Builder v2 uses this approach:
Information gathering state: 9 specific questions, asked one at a time
Confirmation state: Echo back what was heard
Compilation state: Build the simulation parameters
Execution state: Run the negotiation
Each state has entry conditions, exit conditions, and no ambiguity about wh=
at happens next. The model never has to guess whether it should ask another=
 question or start simulating. The prompt tells it exactly when to transiti=
on.
=E2=9C=93 Good:
You are the Digital-Twin Negotiation Builder.
1. Ask one=E2=80=94and only one=E2=80=94question at a time
2. Confirm each answer
3. After all answers, generate runnable simulation
4. Immediately transition to simulation mode
=E2=9C=93 Better (what we actually use):
Your mission:
1. Elicit exactly the information needed to run a realistic multi-stakehold=
er negotiation.
2. Ask one=E2=80=94and only one=E2=80=94question at a time; wait for the us=
er's reply before continuing.
3. Confirm each answer in a single sentence.
4. When all answers are gathered, generate a **single, runnable simulation =
prompt**
5. Paste that runnable prompt as plain text, then **immediately transition =
into simulation mode**
This structure does something powerful: it separates the builder (who sets =
up the simulation) from the host (who runs it). These are different roles r=
equiring different capabilities. By making this separation explicit, we avo=
id the most common failure mode where the AI keeps trying to "help" by aski=
ng clarifying questions mid-negotiation.
What Makes Negotiations Realistic
A good negotiation simulation needs three things most prompts miss:
Genuine Conflict: Real stakeholders have competing interests. The CFO cares=
 about burn rate. The CTO cares about technical debt. The sales leader care=
s about customer promises. If everyone's trying to help you succeed, you're=
 not simulating=E2=80=94you're fantasizing.
Watch how the prompt enforces this through personality cues:
Personality cues
=E2=80=A2 CTO: Worried about timeline slippage and technical complexity
=E2=80=A2 CFO: Concerned about burn rate and unit economics
=E2=80=A2 Director of Eng: Thinks we should focus on core product, not new =
features
These aren't just descriptions=E2=80=94they're conflict generators. The CTO=
 and Director of Eng will naturally align against new features. The CFO wil=
l push back on anything that increases burn. Instant tension.
Position Tracking: Negotiations are dynamic. People make concessions, dig i=
n on certain points, and trade priorities. The prompt includes explicit "co=
ncession ledger" tracking:
CONCESSION LEDGER
- Director Product: Agreed to phased rollout vs. full launch
- CTO: Accepted 2-engineer allocation if milestones met
- CFO: Approved $200k budget pending Q2 metrics
This isn't just scorekeeping=E2=80=94it forces the model to maintain state =
about who's given ground on what.
Distinct Voices Under Pressure: It's easy to sound different when everyone'=
s calm. The real test is round three when positions harden. The prompt uses=
 "opening statements" to establish strong initial positions that create nat=
ural tension. This prevents the "everyone becomes helpful" degradation.
Model Behavior Differences
This is where things get interesting: while testing this prompt, I ran iden=
tical negotiations through o3 and 4o=E2=80=94same setup, same responses, sa=
me everything. The outcomes were strikingly different.=20
The o3 model played hardball, pushing back clearly on compensation expectat=
ions, while the 4o model responded with compliments and minimal resistance,=
 leading to a noticeably softer negotiation stance and a higher final offer=
=2E=20
At first glance, you might assume the higher offer from 4o indicates a win,=
 but you=E2=80=99d be mistaken. The real point of these exercises is realis=
tic practice for actual negotiations.=20
A model offering compliments in the middle of a compensation negotiation is=
n=E2=80=99t realistically capturing genuine dynamics=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s a=
 subtle but crucial indication of a less sophisticated model.=20
Do with this what you will: you can use 4o as easy mode if you like. Or you=
 can stick with o3 or another advanced model (ChatGPT-5 soon?) for a more r=
ealistic simulation. I=E2=80=99ll break down the differences in more detail=
 later in this piece.
Detailed Deconstruction
The Full Prompt Architecture
Let me show you the actual prompt structure:
You are the **Digital-Twin Negotiation Builder**.=20
Your mission:=20
1. Elicit exactly the information needed to run a realistic multi-stakehold=
er negotiation.=20
2. Ask one=E2=80=94and only one=E2=80=94question at a time; wait for the us=
er's reply before continuing.=20
3. Confirm each answer in a single sentence.=20
4. When all answers are gathered, generate a **single, runnable simulation =
prompt** that:=20
=E2=80=A2 embeds every confirmed detail (scenario, roles, numbers, rules, e=
tc.)=20
=E2=80=A2 contains inline data tables if the user has not provided external=
 files=20
=E2=80=A2 includes clear OUTPUT rules and a "BEGIN ROUND 1 NOW" delimiter=
=20
5. Paste that runnable prompt as plain text, then **immediately transition =
into simulation mode** by printing the Round 1 opening statements of every =
twin.
Notice the cascade of specificity. We don't just say "gather information"=
=E2=80=94we specify exactly how. We don't just say "create a prompt"=E2=80=
=94we define what must be embedded. Every instruction builds on the previou=
s one.
Phase 1: World Building Through Questions
The prompt uses exactly 9 questions. Here's the complete script (also in th=
e master prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/f83f07be-787f-4daa-a153-55c=
2b769f1eb?j=3DeyJ1IjoiNWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPO=
w0 ])
### QUESTION SCRIPT (ask in this exact order)
1. **Scenario (1-2 sentences)** =E2=80=94 "What situation are we negotiatin=
g?"
2. **Stakeholder roles & titles** =E2=80=94 "List each participant (one dig=
ital twin per line)."
3. **Primary success metric** =E2=80=94 "How will you judge a 'win'?"
4. **User-controlled role** =E2=80=94 "Which twin will *you* play?"
5. **Dialogue rounds** =E2=80=94 "How many turns before timeout?"
6. **Comp/Deal data** =E2=80=94 "Provide any key numbers or attach a file; =
otherwise give ballpark figures."
7. **Personality cues** =E2=80=94 "One line per twin: traits or motivations=
=2E"
8. **Constraints & policies** =E2=80=94 "Any comp bands, legal limits, or a=
pproval gates?"
9. **Output preferences** =E2=80=94 "Transcript style & word-limit for the =
final debrief."
Let me show you how this plays out in practice with real examples:
Question 1 Response (Product Pitch):
"Product pitch for LLM-to-SQL project"
Question 1 Response (Salary Negotiation):
"Final-stage compensation negotiation for Director of Product role"
Notice how brief these are. The constraint forces clarity.
Question 6 - The Flexibility Test: Here's where I broke the prompt design o=
n purpose! Instead of providing just a number of conversation rounds (e.g. =
3), I dumped 300 words, just to see what would happen:
keep in mind this is the proposal I put in front of the team
# Conversational Analytics: Transforming Data Discovery Through Natural Lan=
guage
**Breaking Down the Last Barrier Between Users and Their Data**
Imagine a world where "Show me Q4 revenue trends by region, excluding refun=
ds" instantly becomes a sophisticated SQL query=E2=80=94no syntax memorizat=
ion, no schema hunting, no frustrated analysts. Our AI-powered natural lang=
uage interface eliminates the technical friction that keeps 80% of users lo=
cked out of deep analytics.
**The Paradigm Shift**
Today's analytics landscape forces a cruel choice: either hire expensive SQ=
L experts or accept surface-level insights from pre-built dashboards. Our L=
LM-to-SQL engine shatters this limitation, democratizing advanced data expl=
oration for every stakeholder=E2=80=94from C-suite executives to product ma=
nagers to customer success teams.
**Intelligent Query Generation**
Built on cutting-edge language models, our system doesn't just translate wo=
rds to code=E2=80=94it understands context, infers relationships, and gener=
ates optimized queries that would challenge even seasoned data engineers. T=
he AI learns your schema, respects data governance rules, and suggests rele=
vant follow-up questions that unlock hidden insights.
**Immediate Business Impact**
Early testing reveals transformative results: 67% reduction in time-to-insi=
ght, 3x increase in self-service analytics adoption, and 89% of non-technic=
al users successfully completing complex analyses independently. Customer s=
uccess teams are uncovering churn signals faster. Product managers are iden=
tifying feature usage patterns in real-time. Sales leaders are drilling int=
o pipeline metrics without waiting for analyst availability.
**The Competitive Moat**
While competitors offer basic query builders, we're delivering true convers=
ational intelligence. Our working prototype demonstrates seamless natural l=
anguage processing that maintains enterprise-grade security and performance=
 standards.
This isn't just a feature=E2=80=94it's the foundation for our platform's ev=
olution into an intelligent analytics companion that thinks alongside users=
, anticipates their needs, and transforms every team member into a data-dri=
ven decision maker.
**Request: Full development approval for Q3 rollout.**
The prompt handled it perfectly. It simply confirmed that it heard me and m=
oved on. If you add extra data you may not get explicit additional confirma=
tion every time, but you=E2=80=99ll see the model remembers in the way it p=
lays the prompt. The Q3 rollout came back as the core of discussion in the =
actual conversation.
Phase 2: The Critical Handoff
This is where the magic happens. After gathering all information, the promp=
t must transform from interviewer to simulation host. Here's an example of =
the actual template it generates (don=E2=80=99t just copy-paste this, you w=
ant the master prompt [ https://substack.com/redirect/f83f07be-787f-4daa-a1=

Why These Design Choices Work: Technical Deep Dive
One Question At A Time
This seems inefficient. Why not ask all 9 questions at once? I tested it:
=E2=9D=8C All at once result:
Users write too much
Miss critical details
Feel overwhelmed
Model has to parse complex, unstructured input
=E2=9C=93 Sequential result:
Average 15 words per answer
Hit all required points
Feel guided
Model gets clean, structured data
The cognitive load difference is massive for the human and the model. Seque=
ntial questions create a rhythm: answer, confirm, next. It's like a convers=
ation instead of a form.
The Confirmation Echo (aka active listening)
After each answer:
"Got it: [paraphrased answer]. Next question:..."
This serves four purposes:
Error correction: User spots misunderstandings immediately
Progress indication: User knows they're advancing
Confidence building: User sees their input matters
State reinforcement: Model commits to understanding before proceeding
Without this echo, errors compound. With it, they're caught early.
Phase 3: Living Simulation - The Details That Matter
Let's examine actual opening statements from my product pitch simulation:
Round 1 Opening:
CEO: =E2=80=9CAlright team, we=E2=80=99ve got a live demo of conversational=
 analytics that could differentiate us=E2=80=94but only if we hit market fa=
st. I want to hear whether this truly moves the revenue needle and how we m=
itigate risk.=E2=80=9D
CTO: =E2=80=9CTechnically viable=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve reviewed the tracer b=
ullet and it maps our schema well. My concern is hitting a Q3 rollout witho=
ut cannibalizing other roadmap commitments. We=E2=80=99d need clear resourc=
ing.=E2=80=9D
CFO: =E2=80=9CPipeline softness means cash conservation matters. We=E2=80=
=99d need confidence in monetization=E2=80=94especially around unpredictabl=
e LLM usage fees=E2=80=94before I sign off.=E2=80=9D
Director of Eng: =E2=80=9COur backlog on core stability is already at capac=
ity. Adding a brand-new AI layer increases surface area for bugs and securi=
ty reviews. Why not finish what customers already pay for first?=E2=80=9D
CRO: =E2=80=9CEnterprise prospects still ask about SOC 2 details and ROI ca=
lculators. A slick AI feature is interesting, but I=E2=80=99m not convinced=
 it will close stalled seven-figure deals on its own.=E2=80=9Deals in my pi=
peline worth $2.5M."
Each opening serves a purpose:
CEO sets time pressure and decision criteria
CTO introduces specific, quantified resistance
CFO demands data (which we provided in setup)
Director of Eng creates resource conflict
CRO adds customer urgency
These aren't random=E2=80=94they're derived from the personality cues we pr=
ovided. The prompt transforms one-line motivations into full personalities.
The Cascade Effect
Watch what happens when you change a single word in personality cues:
Version A: "CTO: Worried about timeline slippage" Result: Pushback focuses =
on delivery dates
Version B: "CTO: Worried about technical debt" Result: Pushback focuses on =
code quality
Version C: "CTO: Worried about team burnout" Result: Pushback becomes about=
 people, not product
One word change cascades through the entire negotiation. In Version C, the =
CTO allies with the Director of Eng about team health. In Version A, they m=
ight conflict about resource allocation. The butterfly effect in action.
Real Examples: Product Pitch Deep Dive
Here's how my actual product pitch progressed:
My Round 1 Response:
=E2=80=9CFrom customer interviews and a review of our competitors in market=
 I've learned we're already behind on AI, and we're in danger of being perc=
eived as un-innnovative. this could hurt pipeline longterm. furthermore, a =
strong AI feature can add sizzle and if we combine it with a commitment to =
address CRO concerns around SOC2 we should be able to unstick some deals. R=
egardless, I think if we wait 6 months we'll be in danger of losing the AI =
race.=E2=80=9D
Round 2 Escalation:
CTO: =E2=80=9CScheduling: to hit Q3 we=E2=80=99d need two dedicated squads =
for eight weeks, plus SecOps review. That displaces our dashboard-revamp OK=
R. I=E2=80=99m open=E2=80=94if we lock scope to NL-to-SQL only and freeze f=
eatures by the end of this month.=E2=80=9D
CFO: =E2=80=9CIf we=E2=80=99re behind on AI perception, I agree reputationa=
l risk exists=E2=80=94but I still need a financing model. Give me guard-rai=
ls on usage costs and a credible payback window. Otherwise I can=E2=80=99t =
support pulling head-count from revenue-producing work.=E2=80=9D
The simulation maintains pressure. Real stakeholders don't roll over after =
one good answer.
Later:
CRO: =E2=80=9CIf we secure three existing customers willing to pilot at a $=
15 K expansion each=E2=80=94and marketing spins a case-study launch=E2=80=
=94I=E2=80=99ll back the release.=E2=80=9D
CTO: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll divert two squads only if scope is frozen by Aug=
ust 1 and Security has a two-week pen-test window. Give me that schedule an=
d I sign.=E2=80=9D
Partial victory=E2=80=94realistic for a first pitch.
Real Examples: Salary Negotiation Breakdown
The compensation negotiation shows model differences starkly:
o3 Version - Full Arc:
Setup: Current offer $180k, asking for $210k
Starting:
Me: =E2=80=9C210 reflects the market average for the role given my zip code=
, and I'd like to come into work enthused and focused on the role, not worr=
ied about comp.=E2=80=9D
CPO (o3): =E2=80=9CI hear you. I can stretch, but parity matters. If I go t=
oo high I need to justify it to Finance. What if we move salary to $197 K a=
nd revisit at six-month review based on impact metrics?=E2=80=9D
Midway:
Me: =E2=80=9CI understand you need approval to move forward above 195, but =
I think realistically we're looking at that either way, since 195 is too fa=
r away for me to feel comfortable given the average comp is 210 in my area.=
 let's see if we can close some of the gap with equity. what if we up the e=
quity to 75k, i drop down to 200, and we put the bonus at 15.=E2=80=9D
HR (o3): =E2=80=9CFrom a policy standpoint, a $200 K salary sits right at t=
he very top of band after cost-of-living adjustment. I can draft the varian=
ce request if we add a clause: equity above $50 K vests only if you remain =
employed through year two and we hit product-revenue targets. Does that sou=
nd acceptable?=E2=80=9D
Finishing up:
CPO (o3): =E2=80=9C$200 K keeps us closer to parity, though it still means =
paperwork with Finance. The equity bump to $75 K feels steep for Series B p=
aper value=E2=80=94but if we tie the extra $27 K to stretch goals, I could =
justify it as upside for over-performance. Bonus to $15 K is workable if ti=
ed to clear milestones.=E2=80=9D
4o Version - Same Setup:
Starting:
CPO (4o): =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve been in this game a long time, and I=E2=80=
=99ll be straight with you=E2=80=94we think you=E2=80=99re the right person=
, but we=E2=80=99re not paying fantasy baseball salaries. We came in at $19=
0K because it fits our internal parity. We can=E2=80=99t just start blowing=
 that up because of some Glassdoor averages.=E2=80=9D
(Already more colorful but less realistic)
Midway:
CPO (4o): =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s a smart counter. You=E2=80=99re signaling=
 flexibility and giving us room to maneuver. $200K isn=E2=80=99t outrageous=
=2E The $15K bonus feels rich, bu=
t I get what you=E2=80=99re doing=E2=80=94ba=
lancing cash and long-term upside. I=E2=80=99m not opposed, but we=E2=80=99=
ll need HR to run the numbers and assess feasibility.=E2=80=9D
(Breaking character to be helpful)
Finishing up:
CPO (4o): =E2=80=9CThen we=E2=80=99ve got ourselves a deal. You came to the=
 table sharp, reasonable, and prepared=E2=80=94exactly what I want in a Dir=
ector of Product. Let=E2=80=99s get it papered and move forward.=E2=80=9D
The 4o CPO folded like a lawn chair. That's not practice=E2=80=94that's wis=
hful thinking.
Psychological Principles
Cognitive Load Management
Humans can juggle 7=C2=B12 items in working memory. In a six-person negotia=
tion, you're tracking six personalities, multiple issues, and your own stra=
tegy. That's cognitive overload before you even start talking.
The prompt manages this through progressive complexity:
Setup phase: One simple question at a time
Simulation start: Clear opening statements establish positions
Mid-negotiation: Concession ledger tracks state
End state: Debrief summarizes learning
Each phase has just enough complexity to be useful without overwhelming.
Sequential Information Processing
The "one question at a time" rule isn't just convenience=E2=80=94it's cogni=
tive science. When faced with complex tasks, humans perform better with str=
uctured decomposition.
Compare these approaches:
=E2=9D=8C Cognitive overload approach: "Tell me about your negotiation scen=
ario including all participants, their motivations, success metrics, constr=
aints, data, and preferred output format."
=E2=9C=93 Sequential processing approach: "What situation are we negotiatin=
g?" =E2=86=92 Confirm =E2=86=92 "List each participant" =E2=86=92 Confirm =
=E2=86=92 [Continue...]
The second approach:
Reduces decision paralysis
Improves answer quality
Creates natural checkpoints
Builds confidence through progress
The Agreeability Problem in AI
Modern LLMs are trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest. The training p=
rocess rewards:
Agreeing with users
Finding common ground
Avoiding conflict
Being supportive
For customer service? Perfect. For negotiation practice? Disaster.
This prompt fights that bias through explicit opposition programming:
Personality cues that mandate conflict
Structured rounds that maintain tension
Success metrics that require genuine negotiation
But model selection still matters. o3 is a reasoning model with more capabi=
lity to simulate multiple personalities (for lack of a better term). It is =
smarter. It will argue longer, concede less, and maintain opposition better=
=2E
Explicit State as Behavioral Anchor
The prompt makes everything explicit. Look at this state declaration:
REFERENCE
Personality cues
=E2=80=A2 CTO: Worried about timeline slippage and technical complexity
=E2=80=A2 CFO: Concerned about burn rate and unit economics
This isn't just organization. When the model can reference "CFO: Concerned =
about burn rate" mid-negotiation, it's far more likely to maintain that con=
cern. The explicit state acts as a behavioral anchor, fighting the model's =
tendency to drift toward agreeability.
Practical Application
Immediate Use Cases
Salary Negotiation Practice
Before your next comp discussion, run three simulations:
Aggressive approach: Ask for 20% above their offer
Creative structure: Lower base, higher equity
Market data: Lead with competitive offers
Real example from my testing:
Simulation 1: Rejected quickly, learned ceiling
Simulation 2: Got creative counter-offer
Simulation 3: Established credibility, got 8% increase
Product Pitch Preparation
Map your actual stakeholders:
CEO: Wants growth but risk-averse
CTO: Overloaded, protective of engineering
CFO: Approved budget last month
Sales VP: Promised features to customer
Run the pitch three times:
Lead with risk mitigation
Lead with revenue opportunity
Lead with competitive pressure
You'll quickly learn which frame resonates.
Difficult Conversation Rehearsal
Need to deliver bad news? Push back on unreasonable request? Set up the sce=
nario:
"Telling CEO that flagship feature will miss deadline" Participants: CEO, C=
TO (you), VP Engineering, Customer Success
Practice different approaches safely. Better to blow up the simulation than=
 the relationship.
Troubleshooting Guide
Problem: All twins sound the same by round 3
Symptom: "Everyone agrees this is a great idea" syndrome
Fix: Strengthen personality cues with specific positions:
Weak: "CFO: Concerned about costs"
Strong: "CFO: Will reject any proposal that increases burn rate"
Stronger: "CFO: Already rejected two proposals this quarter for budget reas=
ons"
Problem: Negotiation ends too quickly
Symptom: Agreement in round 2, nothing left to discuss
Fix: Add multiple conflict dimensions:
Budget AND timeline AND resources
Create competing stakeholder promises
Add external constraints (board mandates, customer commitments)
Problem: Not enough pushback
Symptom: Everyone's too helpful
Fix:
Switch to o3 model (or Claude 4 Opus should work)
Add pre-existing skepticism: "CTO: Burned by last three AI initiatives"
Create zero-sum dynamics: "Budget comes from CTO's project"
Problem: Can't integrate complex data
Symptom: Model ignores your numbers
Fix: Use structured formats:
| Metric | Current | Proposed | Impact |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Burn | $2M/Q | $2.3M/Q | -2 months runway |
| Revenue | $500k | $2M | +300% growth |
Quick Scenario Template Library
Sales Negotiation Variant
Participants:
- You: Account Executive
- Champion: Director of IT (supportive)
- Economic Buyer: CFO (skeptical)
- Procurement: (focused on terms)
- Legal: (risk-averse)
Key tensions:
- Price vs. contract length
- Payment terms (net 30 vs. quarterly prepay)
- SLA requirements
- Liability caps
Interview Practice Variant
Participants:
- Hiring Manager (technical depth focus)
- Skip-level (leadership/vision focus)
- Peer (culture fit focus)
- HR (process/comp focus)
Success metric: Strong hire recommendation
Rounds: 4 (one per interviewer)
Board Presentation Variant
Participants:
- CEO (your boss, supportive but cautious)
- Board Member 1: Former operator (metrics-focused)
- Board Member 2: VC (growth-focused)
- Board Member 3: Independent (governance-focused)
- CFO (cost-focused)
Data: Include burn rate, growth metrics, competitive landscape
Advanced Techniques
Strategic Model Selection
Model choice is a tool selection problem:
Use o3 for:
Final practice before high-stakes negotiations
Adversarial scenarios (comp, budget cuts)
When you need realistic pushback
Use 4o for:
Brainstorming sessions
Collaborative planning
When exploring creative solutions
Use both to:
See the range of possible responses
Understand best vs. worst case scenarios
Calibrate your expectations
Multi-Session Memory Patterns
The prompt doesn't maintain memory, but you can build your own:
Response Library Building:
Objection: "We don't have budget"
Tested responses:
=E2=9C=97 "But the ROI is clear" =E2=86=92 CFO unmoved
=E2=9C=93 "What if it's self-funding through Q1 revenue?" =E2=86=92 CFO int=
erested
=E2=9C=93 "Can we reallocate from Project X?" =E2=86=92 Opens negotiation
After 10+ simulations, you'll have battle-tested responses for common objec=
tions.
Pattern Recognition Across Scenarios
Patterns emerge across different negotiations:
Technical stakeholders respond to:
Phased approaches
Risk mitigation
Clear technical specifications
Financial stakeholders respond to:
Self-funding proposals
Clear ROI timelines
Comparative cost analysis
Executive stakeholders respond to:
Strategic alignment
Competitive pressure
Customer voice
Document these patterns. They're transferable insights.
The Cascade Effect in Practice
Small changes create large differences. Example from testing:
Base prompt: "CFO: Concerned about costs"
Result: Generic pushback on price
Cascade variant 1: "CFO: Burned by IT overspend last quarter"
Result: Demands detailed cost breakdown
Requires ROI proof
Suggests smaller pilot
Cascade variant 2: "CFO: Has budget but wants to see traction first"
Result: Open to spending if milestones met
Negotiation shifts to timeline
Success metrics become critical
One personality cue change shifts the entire negotiation dynamic.
Building Negotiation Intuition
After running 20+ simulations, you develop intuition:
Opening gambits matter - Strong first positions anchor expectations
Concession timing - Too early seems desperate, too late seems inflexible
Coalition building - Getting CTO support helps with CEO
Pressure points - Every stakeholder has something they can't compromise
This intuition transfers to real negotiations.
Why This Architecture Matters
This prompt succeeds because it solves the three core problems of multi-age=
nt simulation:
State Management: Explicit tracking prevents drift
Role Separation: Builder vs. host prevents confusion
Behavioral Anchoring: Personality cues maintain character
But the real innovation is the handoff mechanism. By creating a clean break=
 between setup and execution, we get consistent, repeatable simulations.
Compare this to the typical approach:
=E2=9D=8C Typical: "Be multiple people arguing" =E2=86=92 Chaos by round 3
=E2=9C=93 This approach: Structured setup =E2=86=92 Clean handoff =E2=86=92=
 Sustained simulation
The architecture enforces quality.
Action Steps
Today: Copy the prompt and run your first negotiation. Pick something low-s=
takes to learn the mechanics. Salary negotiation for a fictional job. Budge=
t approval for a side project. Get comfortable with the flow.
This Week: Run three different scenarios. Vary the participants, constraint=
s, and your approach. Document what works. Build your response library.
Next Phase: Customize for your reality. Map your actual stakeholders. Use r=
eal numbers (approximately). Practice the conversations that matter.
The Meta-Learning: Every simulation teaches three things:
How to handle specific objections
How negotiations flow dynamically
How to read stakeholder motivations
Key Learning: Less agreeable models provide better practice. Pick a reasoni=
ng model for best results. But for negotiation simulation, you want the AI =
that will fight back. Currently, that's o3. Or maybe Gemini 2.5 Pro. Or Cla=
ude Opus 4. Use them.
The prompt is a tool, but the real value is in the practice. Every simulati=
on teaches you something about negotiation dynamics, stakeholder management=
, and your own responses under pressure. You are literally simulating timel=
ines!
Run enough simulations and you'll walk into real negotiations with the quie=
t confidence of someone who's been there before.
Because in a way, you have. And that=E2=80=99s how you build digital twins =
with no code!

parating scenario setup from active simulation. First, I sequentially gathe=
