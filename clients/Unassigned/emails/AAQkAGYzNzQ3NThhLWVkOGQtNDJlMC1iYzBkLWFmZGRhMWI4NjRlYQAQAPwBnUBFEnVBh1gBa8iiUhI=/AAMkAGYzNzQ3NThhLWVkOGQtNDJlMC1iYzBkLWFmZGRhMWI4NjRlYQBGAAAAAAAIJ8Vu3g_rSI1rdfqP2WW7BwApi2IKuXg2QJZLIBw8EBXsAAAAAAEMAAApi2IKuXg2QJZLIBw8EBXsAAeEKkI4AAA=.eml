Engineering teams ask the wrong questions about AI all the time.
And the rest of us suffer.
Because this isn=E2=80=99t just about picking the best tool (Claude or Code=
x?) for AI coding.=20
It=E2=80=99s really about the kinds of assumptions we make when we add mass=
ive rocket boosters to our existing systems. Because that=E2=80=99s what AI=
 is: a rocket booster. It can lift you to the moon, or you can crash out wi=
th bad assumptions, bad data, bad team practices=E2=80=A6the list goes on.
So when OpenAI launched a brand new ChatGPT-5 model for engineers and made =
it available via their Codex platform, I wanted to do a special on Codex an=
d how teams should use it.
But then I looked at my inbox. And I shook my head. Because that would be i=
rresponsible until we talk about this piece first: the truth is that the ri=
ght tool is the wrong question for most teams, because a suboptimal tool wi=
th the right team and infrastructure configuration will matter MUCH more th=
an a perfect coding model.
And so we=E2=80=99ll do Codex! In fact if you want the details on that I re=
corded a bonus video on Codex just for this newsletter. And we=E2=80=99ll a=
 deep dive soon.
But in the meantime, most of this newsletter is about 14 questions that eng=
ineering teams need to be asking=E2=80=94not just for themselves, but for a=
ll of us.=20
Because the truth is so called =E2=80=9Ccoding agents=E2=80=9D are increasi=
ngly used for much more than coding, so these technical decisions affect pr=
oduct managers, marketers, customer success=E2=80=94really everyone in the =
business. And teams aren=E2=80=99t asking that wider question when they eva=
luate these tools because they=E2=80=99re used to software.
So let=E2=80=99s ask ourselves better questions! Let=E2=80=99s give ourselv=
es the chance to actually accelerate with AI by setting up our infrastructu=
re so that AI rockets us in the right direction, not toward a big messy dis=
aster.=20
Both futures are possible, and these questions are what separate good teams=
 from bad. Dig in and let=E2=80=99s have a good conversation on this one!

Why AI Coding Assistants Fail at Most Companies
Sidebar: Yes Codex dropped an update
I was going to write about Codex. I really was. But what I=E2=80=99m actual=
ly gonna do is give you a quick summary of Codex and then hop right into th=
e bigger issue: you=E2=80=99re not ready for Codex. Because you=E2=80=99re =
probably not asking the real questions you need to ask about how you engine=
er.=20
Want the deets on Codex? Check out this extra video here:
But that=E2=80=99s not the real story
The real story is that most people ask the Claude vs. Codex question when t=
hey SHOULD be asking these questions instead. (And no it=E2=80=99s not just=
 me asking this=E2=80=94check out this viral Reddit post [ https://substack=
=2Ecom/redirect/73257329-47d3-4a73-a7f=

zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ] on vibe coding at FAANG.)
So with infrastructure top-of-mind, this piece is divided into two sets of =
7 questions each:
Section 1: What do I do before picking an AI agent?
Section 2: I picked an AI agent, now what do I do?
And because we like to have fun around here, I=E2=80=99ll give you one bonu=
s question here at the top:
Bonus Q: Do we know where in our overall development workflow we are bottle=
necked?
Why ask that? Because that=E2=80=99s a question that may imply you don=E2=
=80=99t need a coding AI to go faster at all. What if the bottleneck is you=
r PM=E2=80=99s? Or what if the bottleneck is your own understanding of code=
? What if the bottleneck is your marketing team=E2=80=99s approval loops?
Most teams would benefit from asking this first, because that=E2=80=99s the=
 more correct way to frame the problem.=20
That being said, if you do need a coding AI=E2=80=94these are the questions=
 to ask!
If you are trying to add a coding AI=E2=80=A6
What specific problem are we solving?
Why Ask: Vague goals like =E2=80=9Cboost productivity=E2=80=9D lead to misa=
ligned tools and unmet expectations. Define measurable outcomes (e.g., =E2=
=80=9Ccut onboarding time by 25%=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Creduce bug rates in U=
I code by 15%=E2=80=9D).
The Stakes: A 2024 GitHub study found 55% faster task completion with Copil=
ot for boilerplate tasks, but only when teams targeted specific use cases l=
ike unit test generation or code refactoring. Broad =E2=80=9Cproductivity=
=E2=80=9D goals often diluted ROI, with 60% of surveyed teams reporting unc=
lear benefits due to undefined objectives. X posts from engineering leaders=
 highlight that focusing on narrow tasks (e.g., automating CRUD operations)=
 yields better results than expecting holistic gains.
Action: Actually name what you are specifically solving for here. What prob=
lem matters that a coding assistant can help with?
Do we have strong engineering practices to amplify?
Why Ask: AI amplifies existing patterns=E2=80=94consistent or chaotic. With=
out design docs, TDD, or clear error-handling standards, AI can propagate a=
ntipatterns, increasing tech debt.
The Stakes: A 2025 METR study of experienced developers found that AI tools=
 actually slowed developers down by 19% when working on real-world projects=
, contradicting developer expectations of 24% speedup. The Uplevel 2024 stu=
dy tracking 800 developers showed AI coding assistants introduced 41% more =
bugs while providing no significant productivity improvements. IBM research=
 indicates that incorporating AI into traditional coding tasks can reduce e=
rror rates by up to 30% when proper governance frameworks are established, =
but only when teams have documented standards and consistent practices in p=
lace.
Action: Can you name a particular practice you know could be better across =
the technical team? Can you define the inputs needed to level up?
Does the tool align with our workflow and tech stack?
Why Ask: Mismatched integrations (e.g., poor IDE support) disrupt workflows=
, reducing adoption. Compatibility with languages or frameworks is non-nego=
tiable.
The Stakes: A Jellyfish guide emphasized that tools like Codex thrive in VS=
 Code-heavy workflows but struggle in niche environments (e.g., legacy COBO=
L systems). A 2025 IEEE study on Brazilian teams found 65% adoption rates f=
or tools with seamless GitHub integration, versus 30% for those requiring c=
ustom setups. X discussions note that CLI-focused teams prefer Claude Code,=
 while IDE-centric ones lean toward Codex=E2=80=99s browser integrations.
Action: Test across your primary IDE, sure. But also look at those non-conv=
entional workflows that may be high value (like non-technical people using =
your coding agent).
How will we measure success and track changes?
Why Ask: Without metrics, you can=E2=80=99t distinguish real gains from per=
ceived ones. Track quality and debt, not just speed.
The Stakes: GitClear's analysis of 211 million lines of code from 2020-2024=
 reveals an 8-fold increase in duplicated code and a 39.9% decline in refac=
toring activities when AI tools are used without proper quality controls. G=
oogle's 2024 DORA report found that while 25% increase in AI usage can quic=
ken code reviews, it also results in 7.2% decrease in delivery stability. M=
cKinsey reports companies pay an additional 10-20% to address technical deb=
t, while IBM research shows over 70% of IT budgets go to maintenance of cur=
rent systems, leaving less than 30% for new projects.
Action: First name why the metrics are matter, then figure out how to measu=
re them and install the metrics.
Is security and data privacy addressed?
Why Ask: AI can leak IP or introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded secre=
ts). Compliance risks are real in regulated industries.
The Stakes: Veracode's 2025 GenAI Code Security Report analyzing 80 coding =
tasks across 100+ large language models found AI-generated code introduces =
security vulnerabilities in 45% of cases. Java is the riskiest language wit=
h over 70% security failure rate, while Python, C#, and JavaScript show 38-=
45% failure rates. AI models failed to secure code against cross-site scrip=
ting in 86% of cases and log injection in 88% of cases. Despite advances in=
 syntax accuracy, security performance has remained unchanged over time, wi=
th GenAI models choosing insecure coding methods 45% of the time.
Action: Demand vendor clarity on data usage. There is no substitute.
Do we have buy-in and training plans?
Why Ask: Resistance from seniors or over-reliance by juniors derails adopti=
on. Training prevents misuse and builds trust.
The Stakes: Harvard Business Review's 2025 study confirmed only 41% of engi=
neers adopted AI tools after a year, with female engineers at 31% and those=
 over 40 at 39%. Fastly's 2025 survey found 95% of developers spend extra t=
ime fixing AI suggestions, while 32% of senior developers report that half =
their shipped code is AI-generated, turning them into "AI babysitters". Res=
earch shows AI adoption breakdown is 40% technical challenges, 30% personal=
 transition issues, and 30% cultural/organizational factors, indicating tha=
t simple prompting workshops miss the real barriers to effective adoption.
Action: Don=E2=80=99t skip this one. Invest like 3-4x more here than you th=
ink you need to.
What=E2=80=99s the total cost beyond pricing?
Why Ask: Setup, maintenance, and fixing bad outputs add hidden costs. ROI h=
inges on sustainable integration.
The Stakes: Geeky Gadgets reported that 25% of teams underestimated mainten=
ance costs (e.g., context engineering), spending 15% more time on fixes tha=
n anticipated. A 2025 IEEE study noted that small teams (<10 devs) saw high=
er relative costs due to setup overhead. Blogs warn that rushed pilots unde=
r delivery pressure inflate long-term debt, offsetting initial gains.
Action: Expect your costs to show up before the value does=E2=80=94and in p=
articular value scales non-linearly at big teams. You=E2=80=99ll get a big =
bang of value once you get that first large AI-assisted project through.
If you already have an AI and it=E2=80=99s not working=E2=80=A6
Is the AI amplifying inconsistencies in our codebase?
Why Ask: AI learns from your code=E2=80=99s patterns=E2=80=94good or bad. I=
nconsistent error handling or naming conventions lead to erratic suggestion=
s.
The Stakes: An arXiv study found that teams with mixed error-handling style=
s saw a 15% increase in debugging time due to AI propagating inconsistencie=
s. X threads describe cases where AI mixed exceptions and error codes, brea=
king systems. A 2025 IBM study noted that clean codebases with documented p=
atterns reduced AI-related bugs by 20%.
Action: Figure out how to measure this in a way that matters to you. Commen=
ts on PR=E2=80=99s? Bugs in production? Issues flagged in architecture revi=
ews? Define it and do it.
Are we reviewing and testing AI output rigorously?
Why Ask: Blindly accepting AI code, especially by juniors, invites subtle b=
ugs. Reviews must treat AI output like human code.
The Stakes: Fastly's 2025 survey confirmed 95% of developers spend extra ti=
me fixing AI-generated code, with senior developers shipping 2.5x more AI c=
ode but becoming quality gatekeepers. The Uplevel study found developers us=
ing AI assistants introduced 41% more bugs into production, while METR's ra=
ndomized controlled trial showed experienced developers took 19% longer to =
complete tasks when using AI tools, despite believing they were 20% faster.=
 Veracode's analysis reveals 45% of AI-generated code contains security vul=
nerabilities, requiring rigorous human oversight to catch flaws that automa=
ted testing often misses.
Action: Are your teams actually checking AI PR=E2=80=99s? Be honest.
Is prompting or context the issue?
Why Ask: Vague prompts or poor context (e.g., outdated docs) lead to irrele=
vant code. Clear specs are critical.
The Stakes: A 2025 IEEE study found that 60% of AI errors stemmed from ambi=
guous prompts, fixable with iterative refinement (e.g., breaking tasks into=
 steps). Blogs on X emphasize =E2=80=9Ctest-first=E2=80=9D prompting: Gener=
ate a failing test, then ask AI to fix it, improving accuracy by 30%. AlgoC=
ademy notes that teams with up-to-date docs saw 40% fewer context errors.
Action: Prompting is probably an issue, as is context retrieval / data chun=
king. Assume it=E2=80=99s an issue until you can prove it=E2=80=99s not a b=
locker and zero in here.
Are errors due to tool limitations or our setup?
Why Ask: AI struggles with complex tasks (e.g., legacy systems) or niche do=
mains without proper setup. Distinguish tool flaws from user error.
The Stakes: CTOL reported that Codex excels at simple tasks but fails 40% o=
f complex, context-heavy tests. A 2025 government study noted 25% lower acc=
uracy in poorly documented systems. X posts suggest switching to agentic mo=
des (e.g., GPT-5-Codex=E2=80=99s --full_auto) for multi-step tasks, boostin=
g success by 15%.
Action: Take an audit approach. How can you root cause issues you=E2=80=99r=
e discovering by getting curious about why rather than settling for a gener=
ic blame-the-AI position. Think Five Why=E2=80=99s here.
Is team usage causing problems?
Why Ask: Over-reliance erodes skills; resistance stalls adoption. Misuse (e=
=2Eg., copy-pasting without review) compounds errors.
The Stakes: AlgoCademy found that 30% of juniors lost coding fluency after =
over-relying on AI, while seniors=E2=80=99 resistance dropped adoption by 2=
0%. A LinkedIn post noted that pairing AI with mentorship reduced blind acc=
eptances by 35%. X threads report teams catching 10% more breaking changes =
with mandatory =E2=80=9Cwhy=E2=80=9D explanations in reviews.
Action: Especially with juniors, make sure that you can show that team unde=
rstanding is scaling. It shouldn=E2=80=99t just be a promotions thing.
Are metrics showing real issues?
Why Ask: Velocity gains can mask quality degradation. Measure amplification=
 (e.g., pattern consistency) over raw output.
The Stakes: The Uplevel 2024 study tracking nearly 800 developers found 41%=
 higher bug detection rates in teams using GitHub Copilot, with no signific=
ant improvements in cycle time, pull request throughput, or developer burno=
ut metrics. METR's study revealed a massive disconnect between perceived an=
d actual AI impact - developers estimated 20% faster completion but actuall=
y took 19% longer. GitClear's analysis shows AI-generated code has 41% high=
er churn rate compared to human-written code, indicating technical debt acc=
eleration rather than quality improvement.
Action: Your metrics should map to anecdotes about product quality. If they=
 don=E2=80=99t, the anecdotes are correct.
Do we need to pivot or prepare better?
Why Ask: Persistent failures often signal inadequate prep (e.g., no cultura=
l audit). Pausing to fix foundations can salvage adoption.
The Stakes: A 2025 government study noted 95% of AI pilots failed due to sk=
ipped audits or vague use cases. Zenvanriel=E2=80=99s framework cut failure=
s by 30% with pre-adoption guidelines (e.g., RAG for context). X posts from=
 CTOs describe pausing pilots to document one system, boosting AI accuracy =
by 25%.
Action: Be willing to take a different approach where your root cause point=
s to a real issue.=20
TLDR
Data confirms that disciplined teams see 20-55% productivity gains with AI =
coding assistants, but undisciplined ones face 10-20% more debugging or deb=
t. The difference lies in preparation and integration. Use these questions =
to build a culture worth amplifying, whether you=E2=80=99re starting fresh =
or fixing a stalled rollout. Pilot small, measure rigorously, and iterate=
=E2=80=94because no AI, not even GPT-5-Codex, can create discipline where n=
one exists.
Start with auditing your discipline, not your code. Don't analyze your code=
base=E2=80=94analyze your practices. How many architectural decisions are d=
ocumented versus tribal knowledge? What percentage of code follows consiste=
nt patterns? How often does code review result in educational discussions? =
When did you last update documentation without being forced?
This isn't a technical audit=E2=80=94it's a cultural one.
The real question isn't which AI tool to choose. It's whether your engineer=
ing practices are solid enough to benefit from amplification in the first p=
lace.
Most aren't. And that's the work that needs to happen first.

20% more debugging or debt. The difference lies in preparation and integrat=
