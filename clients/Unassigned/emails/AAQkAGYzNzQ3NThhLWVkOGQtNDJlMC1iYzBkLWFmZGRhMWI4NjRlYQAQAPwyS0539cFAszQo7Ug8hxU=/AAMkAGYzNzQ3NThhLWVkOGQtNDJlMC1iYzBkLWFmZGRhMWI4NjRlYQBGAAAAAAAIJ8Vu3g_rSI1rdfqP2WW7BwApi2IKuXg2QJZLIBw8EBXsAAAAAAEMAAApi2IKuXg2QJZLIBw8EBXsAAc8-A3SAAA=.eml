So Mary Meeker wrecked my weekend. She=E2=80=99s an incredible internet leg=
end and she dropped a 340 slide report on AI (her first major public report=
 in 5 years). I had to dig in.=20
Fair warning, there=E2=80=99s a lot here. I=E2=80=99ll cover the report its=
elf. What I think of it as far as takeaways go, and give you more on Mary a=
nd reaction around the web toward the end.
Small note for free subscribers: this is my monthly free deep dive report, =
hope you enjoy! Lots more good stuff like this weekly behind the paywall.

Part 1: The report itself
Key Insights from Mary Meeker=E2=80=99s 2025 TAI Report on AI
In Bond Capital=E2=80=99s 2025 Technology as Innovation (TAI) Report [ http=
s://substack.com/redirect/404052be-874a-48f4-8bb7-0aed8f245468?j=3DeyJ1Ijoi=
NWtiOTN6In0.zdzy88YFxPmLQJf9hshgUC7BDnPG6RxQ4tAjMRMPOw0 ], Mary Meeker =E2=
=80=93 the famed tech analyst known for her Internet Trends decks =E2=80=93=
 delivers a data-packed analysis of the ongoing AI revolution. The 340-page=
 slideshow (titled =E2=80=9CTrends =E2=80=93 Artificial Intelligence=E2=80=
=9D) emphasizes that the pace of AI development and adoption is historicall=
y unprecedented. Below is a summary of the report=E2=80=99s most important =
AI-related insights. It=E2=80=99s a bit dense, and there are lots of graphs=
!
Top AI Trends and Takeaways from the Report
Meeker=E2=80=99s report backs up its bold claims with extensive data and ch=
arts. Key AI insights include:
Unprecedented User Adoption: Generative AI has reached users at a record-sh=
attering pace. For example, ChatGPT hit 800 million weekly active users in =
just 17 months, a user growth curve =E2=80=9Cunprecedented=E2=80=9D in tech=
 history . In under two years, ChatGPT accumulated about 365 billion annual=
 searches, a milestone that took Google 11 years to achieve . This meteoric=
 rise highlights how quickly AI tools are being embraced worldwide.
Soaring Investment in AI Infrastructure: The =E2=80=9CBig Six=E2=80=9D U.S.=
 tech giants (Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) spent $212=
=E2=80=AFbillion on capital expenditures in 2024, a 63% year-over-year jump=
, largely pouring into AI chips, data centers, and cloud infrastructure. Me=
eker frames this as tech=E2=80=99s next platform bet =E2=80=93 AI is prompt=
ing record investment to keep up with demand. Even chip innovation is racin=
g ahead: NVIDIA=E2=80=99s latest 2024 Blackwell GPU achieves 105,000=C3=97 =
greater energy-efficiency per AI token than its 2014 predecessor, enabling =
far cheaper and faster model inference.
Costs: High to Train, Plummeting to Use: Training cutting-edge AI models is=
 extremely capital-intensive =E2=80=93 up to $1 billion for a single model =
=E2=80=93 but the cost of using AI (=E2=80=9Cinference=E2=80=9D) has plunge=
d by ~99% in two years (measured per million tokens). In other words, it=E2=
=80=99s incredibly expensive to build frontier models, yet using AI service=
s is rapidly becoming cheaper. This sharp cost decline for usage is enablin=
g wider adoption, even as top-tier model development remains accessible onl=
y to well-funded players.
Intense Competition & Rapid Imitation: The AI arena has become a fiercely c=
ompetitive global =E2=80=9Cspace race.=E2=80=9D Rival labs and even open-so=
urce communities are matching new AI features at breakneck speed and often =
at lower cost . Meeker notes that open-source and Chinese models are quickl=
y catching up to proprietary Western AI models, eroding traditional moats. =
For example, she highlights that Chinese firms (like the hypothetical =E2=
=80=9CDeepSeek=E2=80=9D) are developing cheaper custom models that challeng=
e U.S. leaders . Tech giants are also building their own silicon (e.g. Goog=
le=E2=80=99s TPU, Amazon=E2=80=99s Trainium) to accelerate AI =E2=80=93 =E2=
=80=9Cthese aren=E2=80=99t side projects, they=E2=80=99re foundational bets=
,=E2=80=9D Meeker writes . The upshot is a fast-follow environment: innovat=
ions propagate globally in weeks, not years, keeping even early leaders on =
their toes.
Uncertain Path to Profits: Enormous sums of VC and corporate money are floo=
ding into AI, but financial returns lag behind the hype. Meeker points out =
that even a premier player like OpenAI generated ~$3.7=E2=80=AFbillion in r=
evenue in 2024 yet spent even more on computing power . Collectively, major=
 AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc.) are valued around $400 billion and =
have raised $95 billion, but many operate at a loss. The report likens the =
current AI boom to a commodity business with sky-high burn rates =E2=80=93 =
similar to how Uber or Tesla spent years unprofitable while scaling . This =
means winners aren=E2=80=99t guaranteed: it=E2=80=99s still unclear which A=
I ventures will achieve sustainable profits, as rapid innovation has come w=
ith intense cash burn and price competition. Meeker=E2=80=99s takeaway is t=
hat consumers benefit from falling costs and fast improvements, but investo=
rs must be cautious until true monetization power shakes out.
AI Approaching Human-Level Abilities: The capabilities of AI models have ma=
de a leap toward human-like performance. By early 2025, 73% of outputs from=
 a prototype =E2=80=9CGPT-4.5=E2=80=9D were mistaken for human writing by e=
valuators . In other words, test subjects could only tell 27% of the time t=
hat the text was machine-generated. This indicates we are nearing a point w=
here AI can produce language nearly indistinguishable from a human=E2=80=99=
s =E2=80=93 a milestone with big implications for education, media, and com=
munication.
Shifting Job Market & Skills: AI is already reshaping the labor landscape. =
U.S. job postings for AI-related IT roles have jumped 448% since 2018, whil=
e listings for other IT roles fell ~9% in that same period . This dramatic =
shift shows how demand is surging for AI skills (machine learning engineers=
, data scientists, prompt engineers) even as traditional software roles evo=
lve or shrink. In essence, tech talent needs to =E2=80=9Cpivot or perish=E2=
=80=9D by upskilling in AI. Meeker=E2=80=99s report underscores that every =
knowledge worker may need to become conversant in AI tools, as companies pr=
ioritize AI expertise in hiring.
Real-World AI Adoption Across Industries: Far from being confined to resear=
ch labs, AI is rapidly penetrating everyday industries and services. Meeker=
 gives striking examples: Over 10,000 doctors at Kaiser Permanente now use =
an AI =E2=80=9Cmedical scribe=E2=80=9D assistant to automatically document =
patient visits . In transportation, about 27% of ride-hailing trips in San =
Francisco are already handled by autonomous vehicles (e.g. Waymo and Cruise=
 cars) =E2=80=93 a remarkably high share in a major city. And in healthcare=
, the U.S. FDA has now approved 223 AI-powered medical devices in 2023, up =
from only 5 such devices in 2015 . These data points illustrate how quickly=
 AI is moving from demo to deployment =E2=80=93 doctors, drivers, and many =
others are already working alongside AI, and that trend is accelerating.
Global AI =E2=80=9CSpace Race=E2=80=9D and Geopolitics: The report casts th=
e rise of AI as a geopolitical and economic game-changer. One standout stat=
istic: China has more industrial robots in operation than the U.S. and the =
rest of the world combined, reflecting how aggressively China is automating=
=2E Meeker suggests that AI prowess may=
 determine future global dominance, as=
 nations that lead in AI and automation could gain massive economic advanta=
ges . She notes that AI has ascended to a =E2=80=9Cnational strategy=E2=80=
=9D level priority for countries . In her words, =E2=80=9CAI leadership may=
 determine geopolitical dominance,=E2=80=9D so the stakes extend beyond tec=
h companies to entire economies and governments. This contrarian framing =
=E2=80=93 thinking of AI innovation in terms of a Sputnik-like race for wor=
ld order =E2=80=93 emphasizes why the U.S., China, and others are investing=
 so heavily. As one investor summarized, the speed of innovation, talent di=
stribution, and infrastructure built now will define who leads and who lags=
 in the next era.
Mary=E2=80=99s Unconventional Perspectives vs. Mainstream Narratives
While much of Meeker=E2=80=99s AI analysis aligns with the tech industry=E2=
=80=99s excitement, some of her emphases stand out as contrarian or unconve=
ntional compared to mainstream narratives:
=E2=80=9CBest of Times=E2=80=9D Optimism for Education: Instead of echoing =
common anxieties about AI in schools (cheating, misinformation, etc.), Meek=
er strikes an optimistic tone about AI=E2=80=99s impact on learning. She wr=
ites that after ChatGPT=E2=80=99s arrival, =E2=80=9Cwe have likely reached =
a generational, fast and furious change across education=E2=80=A6 This shou=
ld be the best of times.=E2=80=9D This upbeat view =E2=80=93 that AI will e=
nhance learning and that universities can thrive if they adapt =E2=80=93 is=
 less gloomy than the mainstream. She urges universities to lead in AI rath=
er than treat it as a threat, calling U.S. colleges =E2=80=9Cbastions of te=
chnological progress=E2=80=9D that must partner with industry and governmen=
t to drive innovation. It=E2=80=99s a pro-innovation stance on academia tha=
t runs somewhat against the grain of popular narratives focused on fear of =
AI displacing teachers or undermining student learning.
Focus on Speed over Caution: Meeker=E2=80=99s report is unabashedly focused=
 on the breakneck speed of AI advancement, repeatedly using the word =E2=80=
=9Cunprecedented=E2=80=9D to celebrate that progress. Notably, she praises =
the bold moves that enabled this rapid growth =E2=80=93 for example, highli=
ghting that Google =E2=80=9Ccouldn=E2=80=99t have launched a product that h=
allucinated like OpenAI did=E2=80=9D and that startups can do crazy things.=
 This perspective implicitly defends the =E2=80=9Cmove fast and break thing=
s=E2=80=9D approach in AI. Mainstream discourse, by contrast, often critici=
zes AI products for their inaccuracies and calls for more cautious rollouts=
=2E Meeker=E2=80=99s take is unconventio=
nal in that she credits OpenAI=E2=80=
=99s willingness to launch an imperfect (occasionally hallucinating) AI as =
a pragmatic gamble that paid off =E2=80=93 something large incumbents might=
 not have dared.
Minimal Focus on AI Ethics/Regulation: Unlike many public discussions of AI=
 in 2023=E2=80=932024, Meeker=E2=80=99s 340-page analysis gives little atte=
ntion to calls for AI pauses or heavy regulation. The report centers on gro=
wth, competition, and opportunities, with scant mention of AI=E2=80=99s soc=
ietal downsides (e.g. bias, misinformation, existential risk) that frequent=
ly headline mainstream media. One policy area she does stress is talent: Me=
eker argues the U.S. must continue attracting the world=E2=80=99s brightest=
 AI minds, implicitly cautioning against restrictive immigration moves. =E2=
=80=9CAmerica has to be a place where the brightest people in the world wan=
t to come=E2=80=A6 Our tech ecosystem would not be where it is today withou=
t a lot of first-generation immigrants,=E2=80=9D she told Axios. This pro-i=
mmigration, pro-talent stance contrasts with more protectionist currents in=
 politics. Overall, her perspective is optimistic and market-driven =E2=80=
=93 assuming that fierce competition and investment (not heavy-handed regul=
ation) will address many issues, a view not universally shared outside of S=
ilicon Valley.
Beyond the Silicon Valley Bubble: Meeker deliberately highlights that AI=E2=
=80=99s biggest impacts are happening outside of the usual tech hotspots. S=
he notes that =E2=80=9Cthe biggest changes aren=E2=80=99t coming from Silic=
on Valley. They=E2=80=99re showing up where software meets the physical wor=
ld=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 in sectors like healthcare, agriculture, manufacturin=
g. This emphasis is a bit unconventional because mainstream tech coverage o=
ften fixates on Big Tech companies or shiny consumer apps. Meeker=E2=80=99s=
 report, by ranging from the printing press to Roomba robots , takes a broa=
der historical and cross-industry view. It=E2=80=99s contrarian in remindin=
g readers that AI=E2=80=99s transformative power extends to =E2=80=9Creal e=
conomy=E2=80=9D industries and that innovation there may have the most prof=
ound societal effects, even if it=E2=80=99s less hyped in tech media.
Part 2: My take
TLDR: Mary is right that Generative AI adoption is exploding, but value acc=
rues only where organizations align real-world problems AI=E2=80=99s actual=
 strengths in workflows; every bigger claim demands commensurately bigger e=
vidence.
I break down this overall take into eight places where Mary and I diverge.=
=20
1. Headline Adoption =E2=89=A0 Uncomplicated Enthusiasm
ChatGPT really did race past every consumer-tech adoption record: eight hun=
dred million weekly active users in just seventeen months is Apple-launch v=
elocity without the hardware luggage. Mary Meeker=E2=80=99s slide is not wr=
ong, and for mid-career operators it matters because it explains why board =
decks suddenly say stuff like =E2=80=9CAssume ubiquitous LLM literacy by Q3=
=2E=E2=80=9D
But nose-bleed user curves can fool you. When Pew Research puts a microphon=
e in front of the same market, 52 percent of U.S. adults say they=E2=80=99r=
e more concerned than excited about AI, and roughly four-fifths insist they=
 =E2=80=9Chaven=E2=80=99t used it at work=E2=80=9D (which again may not be =
true, since people lie in surveys).=20
Those two statements can co-exist because people under-report behaviour tha=
t feels rule-breaking (or r=C3=A9sum=C3=A9-threatening) yet still hammer Ch=
atGPT for rewrite-my-email errands. If you look at TikTok, AI how-to clips =
do crazy engagement even as the comments fill with =E2=80=9Cthis is how we =
lose our jobs.=E2=80=9D Usage is feeding anxiety, not replacing it.
That fear-while-using dynamic shows up inside companies as AI resistance=E2=
=80=94the quiet decision to keep the LLM sandboxed in =E2=80=9Csafe=E2=80=
=9D corners of the workflow. The sales VP mandates a call-summary bot; reps=
 paste call notes in once a week so the dashboard lights up green, then typ=
e the real deal analysis in a private Slack thread. Engineering leadership =
buys twenty Copilot seats; half the team switches it off after the first au=
to-import fiasco. The metric you=E2=80=99re staring at looks like adoption,=
 but as a leader you can=E2=80=99t figure out why you don=E2=80=99t feel th=
e change.
Why does this matter for you, the person who has to green-light an AI budge=
t before the next sprint review? Because behavioural adoption =E2=89=A0 org=
anisational value capture. Meeker=E2=80=99s chart tells you the surface are=
a is there=E2=80=94hundreds of millions of people are now culturally comfor=
table opening an LLM prompt. What it doesn=E2=80=99t tell you is how much f=
riction sits between that first prompt and repeatable, audited, P&L-visible=
 output. If you mistake raw usage for strategic buy-in you will overspend o=
n tooling, underestimate training time, and meet the CFO in a very unpleasa=
nt conversation six months from now.
The practical takeaway is to treat headline adoption as a floor rather than=
 a forecast. Assume your end-users already use LLMs=E2=80=94some openly, ma=
ny surreptitiously=E2=80=94and design roll-outs that convert that skunkwork=
s energy into sanctioned, supportable workflows. That means:
Re-instrumenting for depth of use, not just active users.
Surfacing early wins where anxiety flips to confidence (e.g., =E2=80=9Cdraf=
t my Jira ticket=E2=80=9D instead of =E2=80=9Cown the whole sprint plan=E2=
=80=9D).
Baking in guardrails and explainability so skeptics inside legal or complia=
nce can say =E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D without losing face.
In other words, believe Meeker=E2=80=99s curve=E2=80=94but read the distrus=
t hiding underneath it. Adoption at scale is real, enthusiasm isn=E2=80=99t=
, and your rollout plan has to bridge the gap.
2. Where the Value Is (and Where It Isn=E2=80=99t)
Capital is no longer the bottleneck. 2024 saw the =E2=80=9CBig Six=E2=80=9D=
 tech firms plough $212 billion into AI=E2=80=90heavy cap-ex=E2=80=94a 63 p=
ercent jump year-on-year and, by Meeker=E2=80=99s own math, almost fifteen =
cents of every top-line dollar those companies earned. It=E2=80=99s the lar=
gest cash commitment to a single computing platform in history. If AI were =
going to print money everywhere, we would already be bathing in the ink.
Yet when you trace the money back to P&Ls, the yield is weirdly patchy. Str=
ipe=E2=80=99s transformer trained on payment events pushed one fraud-patter=
n catch rate from fifty-seven to ninety-seven percent overnight and dropped=
 straight to the bottom line. Kaiser Permanente=E2=80=99s ambient-scribe ro=
llout frees three hours a week for twenty-five thousand clinicians; even at=
 not-for-profit wage rates the ROI lands comfortably in eight figures. Nvid=
ia=E2=80=99s sovereign-cloud business=E2=80=94the deal where a national tel=
co pays to keep all tokens onshore=E2=80=94books up-front hardware revenue =
and locks in a decade of GPU service fees. These are boring, contract-backe=
d wins and they live almost entirely inside B2B or infra workflows.
Contrast that with the consumer side. Two years after ChatGPT=E2=80=99s deb=
ut we still have=E2=80=A6ChatGPT. Not because founders aren=E2=80=99t tryin=
g, but because incremental consumer features die the moment OpenAI or Googl=
e wedges them into the base model, and because consumers habit-stack: once =
you have a single chat box anchored on your phone, every new one feels like=
 toggling search engines circa 2004. The economics look even harsher for ve=
nture-backed =E2=80=9CGPT wrappers=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94Meeker=E2=80=99s slide =
on collapsing inference costs is good news for end-users and hyperscalers, =
lethal for startups that mark up tokens for margin.
Inside the enterprise the story is different. Token deflation is a tail-win=
d, not a threat, if you own a lever the platforms won=E2=80=99t touch:
Data gravity =E2=80=93 proprietary or regulated corpuses (medical imaging, =
trade documents, tele-metrics) that outsiders cannot legally pull into pre-=
training.
Reward ambiguity =E2=80=93 industries where you can underwrite the outcome =
(fraud risk, quality-of-care scores, turbine uptime) and price on financial=
 exposure rather than tokens. Risk pays!
Compliance bottlenecks =E2=80=93 any workflow where passing the audit is th=
e moat, because you already paid that year-long legal bill and your faster-=
moving competitor hasn=E2=80=99t.
Meeker=E2=80=99s deck tallies the cap-ex and the cost curves; it doesn=E2=
=80=99t call out these friction points because friction isn=E2=80=99t visib=
le from the thirty thousand foot level this deck operates at. But for opera=
tors these constraints define where the next tranche of value will land.
So as you plan the next two quarters, ask three questions Meeker doesn=E2=
=80=99t:
What is my non-fungible input? (Data, distribution, or domain liability.)
Will cheaper tokens enlarge my margin, or compress it?
Can I prove ROI inside a budgeting cycle, the way Stripe and Kaiser did?
Answer yes to all three and the money pouring into infrastructure will flow=
 straight through your ledger. Miss one, and you=E2=80=99ll end up writing =
the polite post-mortem titled =E2=80=9CWhy Our AI Initiative Was Strategica=
lly Important But Commercially Premature.=E2=80=9D
3. Advanced Models =E2=89=A0 Magic=E2=80=94Bigger Claims Need Bigger Proof
Every quarter the benchmarking headlines arrive: GPT-4o beats humans at X; =
o3 beats humans at Y; Gemini jumps backwards through hoops and discovers ca=
ncer drugs. I kid I kid. Even if we joke about overfitting on tests, the nu=
mbers are real=E2=80=94Meeker=E2=80=99s slide deck plots a straight-line as=
cent from GPT-3 to today=E2=80=99s frontier models=E2=80=94but the temptati=
on is to treat that line as a direct proxy for business value. It isn=E2=80=
=99t, and the gap between benchmark brilliance and production impact widens=
 the closer you work to messy, legacy workflows.
Think of it as a gear-ratio problem.=20
Benchmarks measure output per token; businesses pay for output per unit of =
context. When the context is a single well-posed coding exercise, the ratio=
 is almost one-to-one=E2=80=94Cursor users really do experience a 10=C3=97 =
speed-up on fresh, green-field files. Move the same model into a 12-million=
-line monolith that predates React and half the juice evaporates.=20
With a context window that big, the LLM burns through its context window lo=
ng before it can map the dependency tree, mis-types a function signature, a=
nd your diff fails CI. The benchmark gain hasn=E2=80=99t disappeared; it=E2=
=80=99s just geared down by integration friction, legacy debt, and the cost=
 of human babysitting.
The same mismatch shows up in non-code domains. Feed Opus or o3 a pristine =
PDF of a sales contract and it extracts key clauses flawlessly; feed it a f=
older of half-scanned, half-redacted image files of documents and the recog=
nition pipeline breaks before the reasoning engine even spins up. Reasoning=
 improvements don=E2=80=99t fix ingestion bottlenecks, memory limits, or re=
al-world variance=E2=80=94they merely amplify them.
This is why the loudest =E2=80=9Cagent=E2=80=9D demos rarely survive contac=
t with production. A frontier model can plan a fifteen-step code refactor i=
n a sandbox, yet the moment you deploy it against live infra you need:
High-recall retrieval just to keep the relevant files in context.
A water-tight eval harness so the agent can=E2=80=99t merge broken code at =
3 a.m.
A human escalation path for the 2 percent of cases the eval still misses.
You need to assume extra investment in evals and systems if you want to dep=
loy production grade LLMs, particularly agents, in 2025. Ignore those extra=
 checks and you=E2=80=99ll be in for a nasty surprise.
4. =E2=80=9CJust add agents=E2=80=9D is the new =E2=80=9Cjust add blockchai=
n=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94until the pager goes off at 2 a.m.
Google Trends confirms Mary Meeker=E2=80=99s hunch: in the first five month=
s of 2025 global search interest in the phrase =E2=80=9CAI agent=E2=80=9D c=
limbed more than a thousand per-cent. Venture memos now swap the word copil=
ot for autonomous agent as though the re-branding alone tacks basis points =
onto IRR. The fantasy is powerful: point a frontier model at your workflow,=
 let it plan its own tool calls, and come back to a finished outcome while =
the humans drink coffee.
And it can work! Companies from Kaiser to Bank of America are realizing rea=
l benefits to the tune of billions on real workflows. I mentioned it above,=
 but Kaiser Permanente has a specialised agent that listens to a doctor-pat=
ient conversation, consults a taxonomy of visit types and ICD codes, then d=
rafts the note in the EHR before the clinician stands up. Early pilots give=
 roughly three hours a week back to twenty-five thousand practitioners=E2=
=80=94a monotonous administrative chore vaporised, and no one need worry ab=
out malpractice because the note still passes through the doctor=E2=80=99s =
eyes before signing.=20
Wayfair tells a parallel story in customer support: an LLM-driven triage ag=
ent classifies chat intent, suggests an answer, and escalates only the corn=
er cases. Resolution time is down, CSAT is up, and the worst-case miss is a=
n annoyed shopper, not a corrupted production database.
Those wins share three characteristics. First, the scope is tight=E2=80=94d=
raft a single note, tag a single chat=E2=80=94so the agent=E2=80=99s entire=
 working set fits into a context window or a tightly-bounded retrieval laye=
r. Second, the input schema is predictable: medical conversations and ecomm=
erce chats follow patterns the training data already knows. Third, the down=
-side risk is capped. If the scribe mishears a medication dosage the physic=
ian corrects it on review; if the chat agent chooses the wrong canned respo=
nse the human rep still owns the ticket.
The moment you step outside that comfort zone your agent is liable to run o=
ff the road like a Porsche on after a late Saturday night. Long-running mem=
ory remains brittle; even with the fattest context windows you can buy, a m=
ulti-tool agent burns tokens faster than it solves problems and falls back =
on retrieval hacks that add latency and drop recall. Orchestration becomes =
a state-machine problem your staff now owns: someone must encode which func=
tion to call, when to loop, and how to back-off on rate-limit errors. Conti=
nuous evaluation is non-negotiable, because a QA pass at the end of a thirt=
y-step plan is too late to catch a silent data mutation in step four. And n=
o matter how glossy the pitch-deck looks, a real production agent still nee=
ds a human on-call who can read stack traces in the middle of the night. Th=
at staffing line item alone prices most mid-market vendors out of the =E2=
=80=9Cfully autonomous=E2=80=9D dream.
Scope is the only lever you wholly control. When an executive asks for an a=
gent, shrink the mandate until you can prove three things in a sandbox: fir=
st, the agent finishes the task 90%+ of the time without rescue; second, th=
e remaining share of failures is bounded, auditable, and reversible; third,=
 every miss surfaces fast enough that a human=E2=80=94not a cron job=E2=80=
=94decides whether to roll back or roll forward. Only after those proofs ar=
e green should you widen the mandate, and even then only a click at a time.=
 Do that and the word agent becomes what Meeker=E2=80=99s deck really promi=
ses: a cheaper execution unit that lives inside the reliability envelope yo=
ur ops team already owns. Skip the proofs, and the first night you leave th=
e thing unsupervised will be the night you remember why cron jobs from 1998=
 still wake people up. Lol.=20
5. Tokenisation Wins Battles=E2=80=94Tacit Knowledge Wins Wars
Transformers have turned the word token into a universal Lego brick. Once y=
ou accept that a payment event, a protein sequence or a LiDAR point-cloud c=
an be sliced into discrete pieces and embedded just like words, almost ever=
y structured dataset in your organisation looks model-ready. Stripe proved =
the point recently: by tokenising the narrative of a transaction (=E2=80=9C=
card-swiped =E2=86=92 merchant =E2=86=92 geo =E2=86=92 device=E2=80=9D), tr=
aining a bespoke transformer, and looking for subtle fraud patterns=E2=80=
=94the company pushed a stubborn enterprise fraud-catch metric from 57 perc=
ent to 97 percent overnight. Meeker flags that case as evidence that =E2=80=
=9CAI eats vertical data sources faster than people expect,=E2=80=9D and fo=
r once the hype is justified.
But tokenization=E2=80=99s reach stops where tacit knowledge starts. The ps=
ychologist Michael Polanyi observed that =E2=80=9Cwe know more than we can =
tell,=E2=80=9D and that aphorism bites every time a model collides with the=
 unsaid parts of work. Your team carries political context the model never =
sees: the CEO who isn=E2=80=99t really plugged in but still demands green-l=
ight status updates; the junior finance analyst who triages vendor emails b=
ecause she knows which supplier will blow up if their invoice is delayed. N=
one of that subtext appears in the source of truth, so no RAG pipeline can =
retrieve it, and no chain-of-thought prompt can reason about it. The result=
 is what I call the gear-slip: the model predicts a perfectly logical next =
action that falls flat the moment it meets unwritten office reality.
Memory and privacy constraints amplify the gap. Even if you wanted to recor=
d every hallway conversation and ingest it as context, you would have to so=
lve three unsolved problems at once: (1) the storage bill for petabytes of =
transient chat; (2) the legal nightmare of capturing material information y=
our own compliance team hasn=E2=80=99t seen; (3) the technical task of patt=
ern-matching across that fire-hose without a billion-token window. Workplac=
e realities mean a lot of work will remain unspoken for a long time to come=
=2E
What to do with this tension
Tokenise with intent. Hunt for data streams where sequence truly implies me=
aning=E2=80=94sensor telemetry, claim workflows, audit logs=E2=80=94then bu=
ild or buy a micro-model that speaks that dialect natively. That is where t=
ransformers still generate shocking delta.
Map the tacit gap. Ask: Which decisions in this workflow rely on political =
context, unwritten norms or pure taste? Flag them for human review up-front=
; don=E2=80=99t trick yourself into thinking a giant context window will er=
ase them.
Treat private context as a privilege, not an inevitability. When legal or p=
rivacy teams block raw chat ingestion, assume they are doing you a financia=
l favor. You have dodged an infinite-storage, infinite-liability bill. Chan=
nel your energy into the parts of the dataset you=E2=80=99re allowed to cac=
he.
Instrument everything you can, narrate the rest. A note-taking agent that d=
rafts a board packet is valuable; the board=E2=80=99s off-the-record reacti=
on lives outside the model=E2=80=99s scope. Capture the first faithfully an=
d accept the second belongs to a human.
The strategic mistake is to swing from =E2=80=9Ctokenization solves nothing=
=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9Ctokenization solves everything.=E2=80=9D It solves th=
e parts of the problem that already speak in tokens=E2=80=94and those parts=
 are growing=E2=80=94but capturing those token streams isn=E2=80=99t going =
to replace the unspoken calculus of power, trust and taste that drives many=
 workplaces. Builders who respect that boundary will keep their models shar=
p and their humans engaged. Those who ignore it will ship systems that draw=
 the right conclusion on paper and still miss the reality.
6. The Durable Human Edge: Judgment, Taste, and Time Horizons
Machines are sprinting; humans still win the marathons that matter. Meeker =
devotes several slides to the hiring boom around AI roles=E2=80=94postings =
for =E2=80=9CAI-adjacent IT=E2=80=9D positions are up 448 percent since 201=
8=E2=80=94but the deck stops short of explaining why those openings persist=
 even as transformer accuracy climbs a power curve. The answer lives outsid=
e benchmark scores. Knowledge has become cheap; judgment has not. Model out=
puts can compress research, drafting, even first-pass designs to seconds, b=
ut the final call=E2=80=94ship or scrap, invest or walk away=E2=80=94still =
hinges on a felt sense for risk, opportunity, and political feasibility.
That sense is built the slow way. Seven-year thinking, the horizon Jeff Bez=
os swore by at Amazon, tends to outperform any quarterly cadence precisely =
because it captures compounding context: how sales, ops, finance, and regul=
ation grind against one another through an economic cycle. The unspoken d=
=C3=A9tente between infosec and product, the latent fear that the market mi=
ght freeze next winter=E2=80=94none of this stuff appears in the token stre=
am. A head of product who has watched five strategic resets and three re-or=
gs carries that texture the way an oak carries growth rings.
Taste is the flip side of judgment. When interface latency, copy tone, and =
error surfacing all converge on user trust, an LLM can propose five viable =
variants; only a human with aesthetic conviction can say, =E2=80=9CThat one=
 feels right for our brand.=E2=80=9D Meeker nods to this without labeling i=
t: she highlights Jony Ive=E2=80=99s partnership with OpenAI as evidence th=
at design will define the next hardware wave, yet the lesson applies everyw=
here. Builders love to adopt Linear over Jira not because Linear=E2=80=99s =
AI is bigger, but because the product feels frictionless. Taste is not a lu=
xury flourish; it is a differentiation layer that tokens cannot undercut.
Persistence is the last unfair advantage. A frontier model can crank throug=
h a day-long coding sprint; it still falters on projects that unfold across=
 quarters=E2=80=94refactors that touch twenty micro-services, partnerships =
that require six legal reviews, migrations that hinge on a vendor=E2=80=99s=
 unspoken roadmap. Humans tolerate ambiguity over long timelines, repriorit=
ize when market winds shift, and, crucially, remain curious after the tenth=
 setback. That capacity is why Shopify and GitHub doubled down on junior =
=E2=80=9CAI-centaur=E2=80=9D hires: they want workers who metabolize tools =
quickly, then stay curious enough to drive cultural change for years, not w=
eeks.
So the edge for mid-career builders is not in knowing the latest prompt syn=
tax; it is in combining synthetic speed with human judgment, taste, and per=
sistence. LLMs will keep gaining IQ points, but the ROI curve flattens with=
out someone who can see around fiscal-year corners, decide which 5 percent =
of output to scrap, and shepherd the rest through compliance, politics, and=
 design polish. If you cultivate that triad=E2=80=94judgment, taste, and se=
ven-year endurance=E2=80=94the cheaper-and-smarter token flood amplifies yo=
ur leverage instead of threatening your relevance.
7. Economics and Policy: Why the Clock Is Ticking Faster Than the Rulebook
On price curves alone, AI is still operating in broadband time while most p=
olicy moves at railroad speed. Meeker=E2=80=99s slide on training economics=
 shows the cost of building a frontier model falling by roughly one order o=
f magnitude each year (today=E2=80=99s GPT-4-class system for under $20 mil=
lion, GPT-3 money now buys you Alpaca-scale pocket toys). Meeker=E2=80=99s =
inference chart is even starker: tokens that cost $1.00 in 2022 cost about =
a cent today and will round to zero inside two more hardware cycles. For bu=
ilders, that graph is both the good news and the booby trap. Every quarter =
you delay shipping, margin assumptions written in last November=E2=80=99s d=
eck are out of date; every experiment that looked =E2=80=9Ctoo expensive=E2=
=80=9D six months ago deserves a fresh run.
Meanwhile, regulators are discovering just how uneven global terrain can be=
=2E The EU is busy wrapping foundationa=
l-model audits, the U.S. banking agenc=
ies are floating =E2=80=9Cmodel-risk principles,=E2=80=9D and half a dozen =
national governments=E2=80=94from Saudi Arabia to Korea=E2=80=94have jumped=
 the queue by dangling tax holidays and GPU subsidies in exchange for sover=
eign-cloud installs. Nvidia=E2=80=99s sales heat-map in the deck is a geogr=
aphy lesson in real time: anywhere a telco or cash-rich ministry can host i=
ts own L40 racks, a =E2=80=9Cnational-alignment=E2=80=9D model is suddenly =
on the roadmap. That fragmentation explains why broad capability caps are a=
 fantasy; you can=E2=80=99t pause a technology when every new data-centre r=
ibbon-cutting creates a fresh jurisdiction.
The practical implication is that cost curves sprint while compliance gates=
 jog. A Chief Risk Officer may need twelve months to sign off on a model th=
at the infra team can train in three weeks, fine-tune in another three, and=
 run for pennies. Builders have two levers to stay ahead of that mismatch:
Audit-ready instrumentation from day one. If you can=E2=80=99t surface what=
 data the model saw, which tool calls it made, and how many tokens it burne=
d, compliance will push your launch past the window where the economics wer=
e attractive. Cheap compute is perishable; don=E2=80=99t waste it waiting f=
or an after-the-fact trace-ability retrofit.
Distribution as insurance. Because code is now the cheapest component, dura=
ble value hides in user relationships and proprietary datasets. When a new =
sovereign-model ordinance pops up, the team that owns the workflow=E2=80=94=
and the trust that rides with it=E2=80=94can swap a backend with minimal ch=
urn. The team that owns only an LLM prompt can=E2=80=99t.
So the clock you are racing is not just Moore=E2=80=99s Law in GPU clothing=
; it is the gap between hardware cadence and policy lead-time. Every quarte=
r, tokens get cheaper and the regulatory thicket gets taller. Ship before t=
he branches close overhead, instrument so you can prove you=E2=80=99re safe=
, and keep distribution close enough that a backend swap doesn=E2=80=99t er=
ase your moat.
8. Ground-Level Value: Where Meeker=E2=80=99s Physics Meet a Builder=E2=80=
=99s Reality
Mary Meeker has always been the internet=E2=80=99s best pilot at 30,000 fee=
t, and this year=E2=80=99s deck is another master-class in macro vision. He=
r slides prove three things beyond argument: compute is compounding faster =
than anyone predicted, capital is willing to chase that curve indefinitely,=
 and consumers are already dipping a billion fingertips into the interface.=
 All of that is true. What those altitude readings can=E2=80=99t show is th=
e topography that decides whether a company makes money while the curve ste=
epens. That part lives closer to the runway, and it looks very different.
Value lives in the stack, not in the curve.
A chip that renders a token for a tenth of a cent is wonderful, but it does=
 not by itself close a customer ticket, file an insurance claim, or pass an=
 FDA audit. The builder=E2=80=99s question is always, =E2=80=9CWhere in thi=
s stack does a customer get value?=E2=80=9D Most often the answer is two or=
 three layers above the silicon=E2=80=94at the pixel-level detail of a use-=
case that finally removes a pain the buyer feels every day.
Detail is what unlocks B2B.
Spend ten minutes with an excellent AI-enabled application and you=E2=80=99=
ll realize the breakthrough is not =E2=80=9Co3-class reasoning=E2=80=9D; it=
 is the fifteen edge-cases the team hunted down until the error rate slippe=
d below the annoyance threshold or the finance team=E2=80=99s charge-back t=
olerance.=20
That surgical discipline is why B2B AI is scaling while consumer AI, outsid=
e ChatGPT itself, feels like a lottery: without strong distribution or bran=
d gravity a new app has no room to iterate through the ugly details before =
it gets copied or drowned out. In business software, detail is defensible; =
in the consumer feed, it is ephemeral. It gets eaten by the consumer gravit=
y well of ChatGPT.
Channel and brand still decide who earns the surplus.
When code is virtually free and features commoditize in weeks, the durable =
moats look old-fashioned: a direct line to the budget owner, a renewal clau=
se, a brand that signals =E2=80=9Cthese people sweat the edge-cases so you =
don=E2=80=99t have to.=E2=80=9D Linear wins because it feels better than Ji=
ra, not because it runs a proprietary model. Nvidia wins sovereign-cloud de=
als because ministries trust its roadmap, not because no one else can fab a=
 GPU. Brand and channel are what let you keep value when the physics give i=
t away.
Talent is the real scarcity.
Meeker shows job postings rocketing, but she treats the supply of skill as =
an eventual function of capital. On the ground that assumption fails. You c=
an=E2=80=99t run an agent in production without someone who understands ret=
rieval fall-off, tool-calling schemas, and guard-rail evaluation.=20
Those people don=E2=80=99t materialize when you wire money to AWS; you have=
 to hire them or grow them, and the market for LLM engineers, prompt archit=
ects, and evaluation-ops leads is white-hot. Companies that treat =E2=80=9C=
AI talent=E2=80=9D as an after-thought discover, six months in, that their =
proof-of-concept is stuck in red-team limbo because no one on staff can deb=
ug a wandering chain-of-thought. And training up teams (often the only opti=
on) is a very hit-or-miss process without LLM expertise inside the company.
The AI acceleration headines are real, but value follows expertise, specifi=
city, and trust. Chips will keep getting faster, tokens cheaper, models sma=
rter=E2=80=94that is the part Meeker measured. The part she could only hint=
 at is where operating value shows up: in the teams that pair taste with do=
main chops, in junior =E2=80=9CAI-native=E2=80=9D hires who drag legacy org=
anizations forward, and in leaders who are willing to grind a use-case unti=
l the last edge-case behaves. It=E2=80=99s the builders that will unlock th=
at AI future in practice.
If you=E2=80=99re wrestling with where to take these takeaways, read Meeker=
=E2=80=99s slides for the direction of the industry, then drop to tree-top =
level and ask three questions:
Which use-case can we own all the way to the pixel?
Which channel or brand asset will keep customers coming back when features =
leak?
Which people=E2=80=94present or newly hired=E2=80=94can carry the load that=
 models still drop?
Answer those with specificity and the macro curve becomes your tail-wind in=
stead of a blur in the sky.
A note on Mary Meeker: Tech Visionary and =E2=80=9CQueen of the Internet=E2=
=80=9D
Yes, if you haven=E2=80=99t heard of her you=E2=80=99re missing out!
Track Record: Mary Meeker is a veteran technology analyst and investor reno=
wned for her foresight. In the 1990s she rose to fame at Morgan Stanley wit=
h influential reports on internet companies, earning the nickname =E2=80=9C=
Queen of the Internet=E2=80=9D. She correctly predicted the potential of on=
line giants like Google, Amazon, and Apple early on. Her annual Internet Tr=
ends reports, published from 1995 through 2019, became a must-read in Silic=
on Valley, crammed with insights on how the web and mobile were transformin=
g business and society .
Investor & Bond Capital: Beyond analysis, Meeker has been an active partici=
pant in tech=E2=80=99s growth. She joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers =
in 2010 to lead its growth-stage venture fund, where she backed future star=
s including Facebook, Spotify, Airbnb, Slack, Ring, and Square (now Block).=
 In 2018 she co-founded Bond Capital, a VC firm where she is General Partne=
r. This dual experience as both analyst and investor gives her a unique 360=
=C2=B0 perspective on tech trends. When Mary Meeker speaks, founders and CE=
Os tend to listen, as she=E2=80=99s seen multiple innovation cycles up clos=
e.
Return to Publishing: After a four-year hiatus from her famed reports, Meek=
er=E2=80=99s 2024 TAI report marks her return to public trend-analysis, thi=
s time laser-focused on artificial intelligence. At 340 pages, =E2=80=9CTre=
nds =E2=80=93 Artificial Intelligence=E2=80=9D is effectively her first maj=
or report since 2019, signaling how important she believes AI=E2=80=99s imp=
act will be. Co-authored with her team at Bond (Jay Simons, Daegwon Chae, a=
nd others), the TAI report extends Meeker=E2=80=99s legacy of data-driven s=
torytelling. By quantifying everything from AI adoption rates to model cost=
s and global talent flows, Mary Meeker is once again leveraging her experti=
se and influence to frame the conversation in tech. Given her history of ac=
curate trend-spotting and the sheer breadth of this report, it=E2=80=99s li=
kely to influence how executives, policymakers, and practitioners understan=
d the state of AI today for the rest of 2025.
Reactions from Other Experts and Media
Meeker=E2=80=99s return to publishing a tech trends report =E2=80=93 and he=
r focus on AI =E2=80=93 has drawn significant attention in just the last co=
uple of days. Tech analysts, investors, and media outlets have offered thei=
r takes on her report=E2=80=99s AI findings:
TechCrunch: The tech press highlighted Meeker=E2=80=99s almost breathless f=
ocus on AI=E2=80=99s speed. TechCrunch noted that Meeker used the word =E2=
=80=9Cunprecedented=E2=80=9D on 51 slides to hammer home how AI adoption an=
d innovation are unlike anything before . Their coverage emphasized her fin=
dings that ChatGPT=E2=80=99s user growth was record-breaking and that AI co=
sts are dropping precipitously. They also echoed her point that competition=
 (including open-source and Chinese models) is driving down costs and match=
ing features quickly, citing her example of NVIDIA=E2=80=99s latest chip be=
ing vastly more efficient than its 2014 counterpart . In short, TechCrunch =
conveyed Meeker=E2=80=99s message that it=E2=80=99s not your imagination =
=E2=80=93 AI really is accelerating everything (the very headline of their =
piece).
Axios (Dan Primack=E2=80=99s Q&A): Axios distilled Meeker=E2=80=99s top tak=
eaways in an interview format. Primack underscored Meeker=E2=80=99s astonis=
hment at ChatGPT=E2=80=99s global growth =E2=80=93 especially outside the U=
=2ES. (hello India) =E2=80=93 and the chan=
ging dynamics of tech distribution=20=
=2E The Q&A highlighted Meeker=E2=80=99=
s view that Microsoft=E2=80=99s early=20=
investment in OpenAI was pivotal, and that Google, despite its AI prowess, =
was constrained from launching a ChatGPT-like product due to reputational r=
isks (hallucinations). She told Axios she doesn=E2=80=99t think OpenAI has =
an insurmountable lead, but she expects ChatGPT to be around for a long tim=
e and noted the =E2=80=9Cintense competition the likes of which we=E2=80=99=
ve never seen=E2=80=9D now underway. Axios also drew attention to her polic=
y angle on talent: Meeker gently criticized U.S. immigration restrictions t=
hat block AI talent, implying that winning the AI race requires remaining a=
 magnet for researchers and developers worldwide.
Inside Higher Ed: This outlet zoomed in on Meeker=E2=80=99s education-focus=
ed insights. It reported on her call for a =E2=80=9Cmindset change=E2=80=9D=
 in universities and for higher ed to =E2=80=9Ctake on an AI leadership rol=
e in partnership with government and tech firms.=E2=80=9D Inside Higher Ed =
noted Meeker=E2=80=99s belief that the next five years are =E2=80=9Cconsequ=
ential=E2=80=9D for academia and that institutions must =E2=80=9Cfind and s=
ustain their differentiators=E2=80=A6 or risk losing market share in an AI-=
enabled world.=E2=80=9D The piece positioned Meeker=E2=80=99s 17-page =E2=
=80=9CAI & Universities=E2=80=9D mini-report (released in mid-2024) as a wa=
ke-up call to university leaders: adapt curricula, embrace AI in research/t=
eaching, and uphold values in an AI era. This educational angle in Meeker=
=E2=80=99s work was well-received in higher ed circles as a clear, if chall=
enging, roadmap for institutions to remain relevant amid AI disruption.
Investor and Analyst Commentary: Many industry watchers seized on Meeker=E2=
=80=99s framing of AI as a transformative =E2=80=9Cspace race.=E2=80=9D Pit=
chBook=E2=80=99s analysis (and posts by VCs on LinkedIn) highlighted her da=
ta showing how AI could =E2=80=9Creshape the world order.=E2=80=9D For exam=
ple, investors noted Meeker=E2=80=99s stat that China=E2=80=99s industrial =
robot installations now exceed those of the U.S. and rest of world combined=
, seeing it as evidence of a national race for automation leadership . The =
consensus among these commentators is that Meeker=E2=80=99s report =E2=80=
=9Creads like a timestamp on a major shift already in motion,=E2=80=9D not =
a distant forecast. In other words, AI=E2=80=99s rapid deployment across in=
dustries is happening now, and Meeker=E2=80=99s trove of charts captured ho=
w far things have already progressed by 2025. This struck a chord with tech=
 investors, who tend to agree with her that the next tech giants (and leadi=
ng economies) will be decided by who masters AI =E2=80=93 a narrative reinf=
orced by her geopolitical and corporate investment data.
Media and Critic Reactions: The tech media broadly praised Meeker=E2=80=99s=
 comprehensive analysis and the return of her famous report. Outlets like T=
he Information dubbed it =E2=80=9CMeeker=E2=80=99s AI bombshell=E2=80=9D an=
d noted how it underscores AI=E2=80=99s breakneck trajectory. A few observe=
rs offered critical nuance: for instance, on forums like Hacker News, some =
argued that not all of Meeker=E2=80=99s comparisons are one-to-one. They po=
inted out that Google=E2=80=99s early growth happened in a smaller internet=
 era, whereas ChatGPT launched into a world with billions online =E2=80=93 =
context that might temper the =E2=80=9C5.5=C3=97 faster than Google=E2=80=
=9D headline. Nonetheless, most coverage concurred with Meeker=E2=80=99s bi=
g picture: AI is rewriting the tech playbook in real time, and even seasone=
d analysts are amazed. The report has been described as both =E2=80=9Cexhau=
stive=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cexhilarating,=E2=80=9D compiling a persuasive c=
ase that we are in a hyper-accelerated tech cycle driven by AI=E2=80=99s su=
dden maturity.
Phew! That=E2=80=99s a lot of info. If you=E2=80=99ve made it this far, wel=
l done! Hope this is a helpful overview of Meeker=E2=80=99s 340 page monste=
r deck and reaction to it. As long as this article might have seemed, I pro=
mise you it isn=E2=80=99t close to 340 pages lol.

 Meeker points out that even a premier player like OpenAI generated ~$3.7=
=E2=80=AFbillion in revenue in 2024 yet spent even more on computing power =
. Collectively, major AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc.) are valued aro=
und $400 billion and have raised $95 billion, but many operate at a loss. T=
he report likens the current AI boom to a </span><strong>commodity business=

esla spent years unprofitable while scaling . This means </span><strong>win=

hich AI ventures will achieve sustainable profits, as rapid innovation has =

mains brittle; even with the fattest context windows you can buy, a multi-t=

rieval hacks that add latency and drop recall. Orchestration becomes a stat=
e-machine problem your staff now owns: someone must encode which function t=
o call, when to loop, and how to back-off on rate-limit errors. Continuous =
evaluation is non-negotiable, because a QA pass at the end of a thirty-step=
 plan is too late to catch a silent data mutation in step four. And no matt=
er how glossy the pitch-deck looks, a real production agent still needs a h=

the slow way. Seven-year thinking, the horizon Jeff Bezos swore by at Amazo=

one another through an economic cycle. The unspoken d=C3=A9tente between in=
fosec and product, the latent fear that the market might freeze next winter=
=E2=80=94none of this stuff appears in the token stream. A head of product =

me how AI adoption and innovation are unlike anything before . Their covera=

<span>. They also echoed her point that </span><strong>competition (includi=

soft=E2=80=99s early investment in OpenAI was pivotal</strong><span>, and t=
hat Google, despite its AI prowess, was constrained from launching a ChatGP=
