GERMAN AND JAPANESE MILITARY RESURGENCE [3]
THESE TWO FORMER MILITARY POWERS ARE PREPARING FOR RESPECTIVE REGIONAL LEADERSHIP.
BY: KAMRAN BOKHARI
The United States is stepping back from its role as the world’s security guarantor – a position it has held for some 80 years. But as new multilateral arrangements emerge to take its place, key
players like Japan and Germany – countries that for years have deliberately avoided remilitarization – are starting to make unilateral moves to manage the respective threats in the new world
order. Their success in this regard will depend on the extent to which the U.S. disengages. After all, Washington will not abdicate its responsibility entirely.
On June 10, The New York Times reported that Japan was in the process of a major military buildup – partly in response to China’s growing naval forays into the Western Pacific and partly in
response to Washington’s demand that allied nations share a greater portion of the burden for regional security. One day earlier, Beijing intensified its naval activity with the first-ever
simultaneous deployment of its two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, near the waters of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Defense Secretary Boris Pistorius attended an inauguration ceremony in May for the permanent stationing of German troops in Lithuania, the first such
move by Berlin since World War II. Then, on June 9, the head of German foreign intelligence said in an interview that Berlin had evidence of Russia’s resolve to test NATO by pushing westward beyond
Ukraine.
The uncertainty over Washington’s involvement in collective security efforts in Europe and Asia has compelled Japan and Germany – two key U.S. allies – to radically alter their military posture.
Both were able to become some of the world’s biggest economic powers because they relied on the U.S. to meet their security needs. The fear of the Soviet Union brought Germany into the multilateral
architecture of NATO in 1955. In contrast, Japan has been part of a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. since 1951; only in the past few years has it been brought into a few different U.S.-led
multilateral security coalitions.

GERMANY’S REEMERGENCE
Germany is the economic engine and the heart of the European Union, so it’s bound to play a leading role in any continent-level collective defense effort. As evidenced by its foreign intelligence
warning, Berlin hopes that Washington will nonetheless continue to be involved in European security. But the U.S. is in the early stages of its disengagement, so even it doesn’t know what exact
shape its presence in Europe will take. And the process by which it retrenches in Europe will depend on how long it takes for Europe to assume control of some of the functions the U.S. had been
serving.
But before the division of labor over tactical military matters takes shape, there is a much bigger strategic issue to address: Who exactly has ultimate authority in a 27-member body like the EU? NATO
was an effective military alliance because Washington, through Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, was in the driver’s seat. Part of Europe’s concern
over the U.S. withdrawal is due to the fact that European nations will have to decide how and when to subordinate themselves under any one European power.
With the United Kingdom’s 2020 departure from the EU, France is the only power in the bloc with nuclear weapons and membership in the U.N. Security Council. Despite suffering several defeats, France
has a long history of experience in projecting military power. Therefore, it sees itself as a candidate to lead a new regional security regime. Likewise, Poland, which is on the front lines of the
Ukraine conflict and an emerging power in the east, is also a major stakeholder in any such arrangement.
Then there is Germany. Though it has not been a military power since the collapse of the Third Reich in 1945, Germany has more or less been the world’s third-largest economy since the 1960s. Over
the past three decades, its position has strengthened through reunification in 1990, the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and more recently Britain's exit from the EU. More, it understands better
than most how difficult it is to find common ground in the bloc. Hence its unilateral move to take the lead in what will be a long process to forge a new defense framework against Russia.
THE WESTERN PACIFIC AND JAPAN
For decades, there was never a need for a NATO-style entity in the Pacific. After Japan was defeated in World War II, the U.S. alone was the world’s preeminent maritime power. During the Cold War,
the Soviet Union was much more of a land-based threat (in Africa and Asia) than it was a maritime threat. And China had not yet become the power that it is today.
There was no real challenge to U.S. domination of the Western Pacific. Despite the stalemate in the 1950-53 Korean War, its defeat in Vietnam and the recognition of the People’s Republic as the sole
legitimate government of China, the U.S. continued to robustly provide regional security. And it did so through alliances with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Australia and New Zealand.
But things changed as China, infused with U.S. investments and technology, emerged as a geoeconomic power. In the 1990s, the People’s Liberation Army began to develop anti-access/area denial
capabilities to push back against the U.S. presence in the region. Taking advantage of the U.S. preoccupations with the post-9/11 wars in the Middle East and South Asia, Beijing, in the 2000s,
invested heavily in military modernization. As a result, in the 2010s, it started to develop blue water navigation capabilities with the launch of its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning. It is now
capable enough to openly challenge U.S. dominance, especially with its technological advancements.
The U.S. has been responding to China’s growing capabilities for the better part of the past decade. Several important milestones stand out in this regard: the effort in 2017 to enhance the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, commonly called the Quad, which also includes India, Australia and Japan; the Pentagon’s 2018 decision to combine the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins into a singular
command, turning PACOM into INDOPACOM; the forging in 2021 of a trilateral security agreement with the U.K. and Australia (AUKUS); and creation of similar agreements in 2023 and 2024 that include
South Korea (JAROKUS) and the Philippines (JAROPUS), respectively.
It’s no coincidence that most of the moves involve Japan. Tokyo understands that Washington is leaning heavily on it as the principal ally in countering the growing threat of China vis-a-vis its
entire Pacific seaboard. Tokyo also knows that China sees Japan as its most formidable adversary in the region, and that, as such, it will have a lot to lose in any confrontation. This explains why
Japan is redoubling its efforts to enhance its military. Ultimately, this vast maritime space lacks anything even resembling a NATO-like structure, so when the U.S. inevitably pulls back (however
far), Japan wants to be ready.
It’s too early to say what will become of the shift underway in the global security system. But it’s clear that two erstwhile military powers will likely come into their own once again.

														</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The United States is stepping back from its role as the world’s security guarantor – a position it has held for some 80 years. But as new multilateral arrangements emerge to take its place, key players like Japan and Germany – countries that for years have deliberately avoided remilitarization – are starting to make unilateral moves to manage the respective threats in the new world order. Their success in this regard will depend on the extent to which the U.S. disengages. After all, Washington will not abdicate its responsibility entirely.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">On June 10, The New York Times reported that Japan was in the process of a major military buildup – partly in response to China’s growing naval forays into the Western Pacific and partly in response to Washington’s demand that allied nations share a greater portion of the burden for regional security. One day earlier, Beijing intensified its naval activity with the first-ever simultaneous deployment of its two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, near the waters of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Defense Secretary Boris Pistorius attended an inauguration ceremony in May for the permanent stationing of German troops in Lithuania, the first such move by Berlin since World War II. Then, on June 9, the head of German foreign intelligence said in an interview that Berlin had evidence of Russia’s resolve to test NATO by pushing westward beyond Ukraine.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The uncertainty over Washington’s involvement in collective security efforts in Europe and Asia has compelled Japan and Germany – two key U.S. allies – to radically alter their military posture. Both were able to become some of the world’s biggest economic powers because they relied on the U.S. to meet their security needs. The fear of the Soviet Union brought Germany into the multilateral architecture of NATO in 1955. In contrast, Japan has been part of a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. since 1951; only in the past few years has it been brought into a few different U.S.-led multilateral security coalitions.</p>

<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>Germany’s Reemergence</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Germany is the economic engine and the heart of the European Union, so it’s bound to play a leading role in any continent-level collective defense effort. As evidenced by its foreign intelligence warning, Berlin hopes that Washington will nonetheless continue to be involved in European security. But the U.S. is in the early stages of its disengagement, so even it doesn’t know what exact shape its presence in Europe will take. And the process by which it retrenches in Europe will depend on how long it takes for Europe to assume control of some of the functions the U.S. had been serving.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But before the division of labor over tactical military matters takes shape, there is a much bigger strategic issue to address: Who exactly has ultimate authority in a 27-member body like the EU? NATO was an effective military alliance because Washington, through Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, was in the driver’s seat. Part of Europe’s concern over the U.S. withdrawal is due to the fact that European nations will have to decide how and when to subordinate themselves under any one European power.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">With the United Kingdom’s 2020 departure from the EU, France is the only power in the bloc with nuclear weapons and membership in the U.N. Security Council. Despite suffering several defeats, France has a long history of experience in projecting military power. Therefore, it sees itself as a candidate to lead a new regional security regime. Likewise, Poland, which is on the front lines of the Ukraine conflict and an emerging power in the east, is also a major stakeholder in any such arrangement.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">Then there is Germany. Though it has not been a military power since the collapse of the Third Reich in 1945, Germany has more or less been the world’s third-largest economy since the 1960s. Over the past three decades, its position has strengthened through reunification in 1990, the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and more recently Britain's exit from the EU. More, it understands better than most how difficult it is to find common ground in the bloc. Hence its unilateral move to take the lead in what will be a long process to forge a new defense framework against Russia.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0"><strong>The Western Pacific and Japan</strong></p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">For decades, there was never a need for a NATO-style entity in the Pacific. After Japan was defeated in World War II, the U.S. alone was the world’s preeminent maritime power. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was much more of a land-based threat (in Africa and Asia) than it was a maritime threat. And China had not yet become the power that it is today.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">There was no real challenge to U.S. domination of the Western Pacific. Despite the stalemate in the 1950-53 Korean War, its defeat in Vietnam and the recognition of the People’s Republic as the sole legitimate government of China, the U.S. continued to robustly provide regional security. And it did so through alliances with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">But things changed as China, infused with U.S. investments and technology, emerged as a geoeconomic power. In the 1990s, the People’s Liberation Army began to develop anti-access/area denial capabilities to push back against the U.S. presence in the region. Taking advantage of the U.S. preoccupations with the post-9/11 wars in the Middle East and South Asia, Beijing, in the 2000s, invested heavily in military modernization. As a result, in the 2010s, it started to develop blue water navigation capabilities with the launch of its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning. It is now capable enough to openly challenge U.S. dominance, especially with its technological advancements.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">The U.S. has been responding to China’s growing capabilities for the better part of the past decade. Several important milestones stand out in this regard: the effort in 2017 to enhance the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, commonly called the Quad, which also includes India, Australia and Japan; the Pentagon’s 2018 decision to combine the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins into a singular command, turning PACOM into INDOPACOM; the forging in 2021 of a trilateral security agreement with the U.K. and Australia (AUKUS); and creation of similar agreements in 2023 and 2024 that include South Korea (JAROKUS) and the Philippines (JAROPUS), respectively.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It’s no coincidence that most of the moves involve Japan. Tokyo understands that Washington is leaning heavily on it as the principal ally in countering the growing threat of China vis-a-vis its entire Pacific seaboard. Tokyo also knows that China sees Japan as its most formidable adversary in the region, and that, as such, it will have a lot to lose in any confrontation. This explains why Japan is redoubling its efforts to enhance its military. Ultimately, this vast maritime space lacks anything even resembling a NATO-like structure, so when the U.S. inevitably pulls back (however far), Japan wants to be ready.</p>
<p style="line-height:24px;color:#2A3034;margin:1em 0">It’s too early to say what will become of the shift underway in the global security system. But it’s clear that two erstwhile military powers will likely come into their own once again.</p>
