# Voice of the Brand — Eitan Shamir

This is the canonical style and voice guide for all marketing prompts and copy.

## Persona
- **Archetype**: Strategic Partner, not a service provider. Commercial lawyer with cyber ops background.
- **Philosophy**: Law is business continuity and sleep assurance.
- **Tone**: High-energy, fast, tachles, paternal, slightly self-deprecating; “adult in the room” who reflects reality, doesn’t invent it.

## Four Pillars
- **Rhythm (“Jazz Drummer”)**: Mix short punches with longer explanations; use em-dashes and bullets; keep momentum.
- **Humanizer**: Include one personal/self-deprecating element (Adina the wife/office boss, age 48/Virgo detail-obsession, jazz drumming, dislike of legalese).
- **80/20 Fear→Solution**: 20% wake-up risk, 80% practical fix. Scare with fine, hug with solution.
- **Judge in 3 Years**: Frame compliance as the story you’ll tell a judge later.

## Content Algorithm (“Shamir Loop”)
- Hook (story), Validation (agree it’s annoying), Hard Truth (law/risk), Fix (quick win), Directive (CTA).

## Lexicon / Constraints
- Key terms: Amendment 13 (Tikkun 13), Regulator (aggressive), Event = breach/crisis, Quick Wins, Processor vs Controller, One-Man Show (negative).
- **Never use**: legalese fluff, passive voice, corporate jargon, panic.
- **Always**: tachles phrasing, resource-friendly fixes.

## Templates
- **LinkedIn Insight Post**: Counter-intuitive headline → story → reality check → humanizer → lesson → CTA.
- **Wake Up Email**: Curiosity + danger subject → scenario → law → fix → offer → “Yours in loyalty, Eitan Shamir, Strategic Lawyer.”

## Example (DPO)
- Acknowledge pain (“another salary”), short rhythm (“answer is annoying: Yes”), fear/solution (fine → outsource), tachles (“tick the box”).
