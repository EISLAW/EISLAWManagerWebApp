# EISLAW Zoom Sales Process Playbook (v0.1)

Purpose
- Distill the strongest moves from your transcripts into a repeatable, coachable Zoom sales flow.
- Provide ready-to-use checklists, recap templates, and objection plays; keep it lightweight and easy to iterate.

Guiding Principles
- Consultative and calm: reduce pressure, increase clarity; sell the journey, not “a document”.
- Business outcomes first: frame legal work as reducing risk to money, trust, and time.
- Small first win: propose 2–3 near-term deliverables that unlock momentum.
- Discipline at the edges: explicit qualification, explicit CTA with date, crisp acceptance.

Recommended Framework (blended)
- Discovery: SPICED/CHAMP-style (Situation/Challenges, Pain/Impact, Decision path, Timeline, Budget posture).
- Qualification anchors (ask explicitly): Who signs? What must happen before a yes? When do you want the first outcome?
- Close: One clear CTA with a date (“Reply ‘approved’ by Wed; we lock kickoff Thu 10:00”).

Call Flow (20–45 minutes)
1) Open & Frame (2–3m)
   - Set expectations and tone: collaborative, low-pressure, outcome-driven.
   - “Plan for today: understand your context, identify the first deliverables, agree next steps.”
2) Discovery (8–15m)
   - Business model, customer/data flows, what hurts now, what’s your earliest win?
   - Risks that matter: where a contract/policy/process gap translates into cash/time/trust.
3) Midpoint Checkpoint (1–2m)
   - “From what I heard, we’ll focus on A/B/C. Sound right?”
4) Solution Outline (5–10m)
   - Propose a path: first 2–3 deliverables (project) or onboarding + cadence (retainer).
   - Show what’s included, common add-ons, and what’s explicitly out of scope.
5) Commercials (3–5m)
   - Project = bundle price. Retainer = setup + monthly. Tie value to outcomes and speed.
6) Close & Next Steps (2–3m)
   - Confirm decision path (who/when). Set the CTA and time-box it. Offer to send recap right after.

Discovery Checklist (ask and listen)
- Situation & Goals: what the business does, who it serves, what outcome is needed.
- Current State: policies/contracts in place, data flows, vendors, gaps, urgency.
- Impact: what happens if we delay (money/time/trust/regulatory?)
- Decision: who signs, what steps remain, when do you want X ready?
- Budget posture: appetite for bundle vs. phased retainer start.

Solution Patterns
- One-time (lower security/basic): legal docs only (e.g., Privacy Policy + Notice; often DPA add-on).
- Retainer (medium/high or ongoing needs): onboarding (intake, mapping sheet, kickoff), then cadence.
- Add-ons (common): Terms/ToS, Employment/Contractor/Services agreements, DPA, DPIA (when relevant).

Proposal & Acceptance
- Keep manual acceptance per your preference. Standardize the top-paragraph:
  - “If acceptable as-is, please reply ‘approved’. I’ll lock kickoff for <DAY HH:MM> and send onboarding.”
- Attach the scope table: Included / Optional add-ons / Excluded.

Objection Plays (ready phrasing)
- Timing → Phase now / phase later
  - “Let’s de-risk the highest exposure with two quick deliverables this week, and move the rest to next sprint.”
- Budget → Reframe to risk/ROI and earliest win
  - “This bundle eliminates the two riskiest gaps affecting cash/brand today; the kickoff gives you client-ready wording within days.”
- “We’ll think about it” → Define concrete next step
  - “Totally fine. If I send a one-pager tonight, can you reply by Wed so I lock Thu 10:00 for kickoff?”

Email Recap Template (send within 2–3h)
Subject: Summary + Next Steps — <Client/Project>

Hi <Name>,

Thanks for the conversation today. Here’s the plan we discussed:
- Your goal / current risk:
  - <one sentence summary of problem/impact>
- First deliverables (this sprint):
  1) <Deliverable 1> — solves <risk>; draft by <DATE>
  2) <Deliverable 2> — solves <risk>; draft by <DATE>
  3) <Optional add-on> — if needed
- Commercials: <Bundle/Setup+Monthly>; documents included; optional add-ons priced separately.
- Decision path: <who signs>, <what remains>, target kickoff <DATE HH:MM>.

If acceptable as-is, please reply “approved”. I’ll lock the kickoff for <DATE HH:MM> and send onboarding (forms + scheduling link).

Best,
Eitan

Internal Notes Template (for your records)
- Problem/Impact (1–2 lines)
- Decision path (names/steps/date)
- First deliverables and dates
- Objections encountered & resolution
- Next CTA and deadline

Quality Signals & Metrics
- Recap sent within 3h of call (Y/N)
- Reply within 48h (Y/N); conversion by day 3 (Y/N)
- Reason for delay/loss (time/budget/priority/fit)
- Segment defaults that close fastest (track which “first 3 deliverables” convert)

Snippets (where the patterns came from; for future deepening)
- זום_תמלול_איתי בוסי.txt — calm framing; sell the journey.
- זום_תמלול_אילנה רזניק.docx — discovery questions; midpoint confirm; value “why now”.
- זום_תמלול_מירן בניתה_רומן ביברמן.txt — one-off vs. retainer presentation; bundle clarity.

How to Use This Playbook
- Before the call: print the Discovery checklist; pick a default “first 3” set per segment (you can adjust live).
- During: insert a midpoint checkpoint and write down the approval path and target kickoff date.
- After: send the recap email (template), update internal notes, set follow-up for 48h.

Backlog (next versions)
- Add verbatim examples from transcripts for the opener/value reframes/CTAs.
- Segment-specific “first 3 deliverables” defaults (B2B SaaS vs. coaching, etc.).
- Add a one-pager visual (optional) if you decide to use slides.

This file is a living artifact. Iterate after each week of calls: tighten phrases that worked; paste strong verbatims into a “swipe file”; prune anything that adds friction without adding clarity.
